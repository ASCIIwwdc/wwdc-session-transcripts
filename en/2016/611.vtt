00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:29.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone.

00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:31.016 A:middle
Thank you for coming.

00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:33.096 A:middle
My name is Megan Gardner.

00:00:33.096 --> 00:00:35.496 A:middle
I am a Software Engineer
on the Game Center Team

00:00:35.696 --> 00:00:37.056 A:middle
and today we're going
to be talking

00:00:37.056 --> 00:00:39.406 A:middle
about what's new in Game Center.

00:00:40.446 --> 00:00:42.826 A:middle
So if you don't know what
Game Center is already,

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:45.556 A:middle
Game Center is Apple's
social gaming network.

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.466 A:middle
It allows you, as developers,
to define leaderboards

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.866 A:middle
which your users can
then submit scores to,

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:53.876 A:middle
also define achievements
that your players can earn.

00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:57.636 A:middle
We also have challenges which
leverage both leaderboards

00:00:57.636 --> 00:00:59.966 A:middle
and achievements to add
a multiplayer element

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.046 A:middle
to your single player games.

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.046 A:middle
to your single player games.

00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:04.086 A:middle
We also have two
multiplayer API's,

00:01:04.086 --> 00:01:05.726 A:middle
both real-time and turn-based.

00:01:06.306 --> 00:01:10.196 A:middle
And we ship all of these
things on iOS, macOS, tvOS,

00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:12.296 A:middle
and this year we are
announcing watchOS.

00:01:12.826 --> 00:01:13.756 A:middle
So what's new?

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:15.916 A:middle
We've got a few new
things this year.

00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:20.956 A:middle
First is we have a great new way
of sending multiplayer invites.

00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:23.206 A:middle
Next we have big news
for the Game Center app

00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:24.496 A:middle
if you haven't figured
it out already.

00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:29.566 A:middle
We have a brand new API for
persistent game sessions

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.026 A:middle
that we're really excited about.

00:01:31.406 --> 00:01:33.596 A:middle
And we're also announcing
Apple Watch support.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.906 A:middle
Now we don't have time
to talk about Apple Watch

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:38.036 A:middle
in this session, but if that's
what you're interested in,

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:41.306 A:middle
I really suggest that you
go to the "Game Technologies

00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:44.306 A:middle
for Apple Watch" later this
afternoon in this room.

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:46.496 A:middle
So let's talk

00:01:46.496 --> 00:01:49.456 A:middle
about message-based
multiplayer invites.

00:01:50.016 --> 00:01:52.986 A:middle
Now you can play with
anyone that you can message.

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:55.576 A:middle
Currently our multiplayer

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:58.716 A:middle
for Game Center pretty
much looks like this.

00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:00.546 A:middle
This is our
GKMatchmakerViewController

00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:00.546 A:middle
This is our
GKMatchmakerViewController

00:02:00.546 --> 00:02:03.056 A:middle
and this is what most of you are
using to set up your matches.

00:02:03.616 --> 00:02:05.406 A:middle
This is a built-in
UI that we have done.

00:02:05.716 --> 00:02:07.176 A:middle
It allows your users to be able

00:02:07.176 --> 00:02:09.006 A:middle
to invite their Game
Center friends as well

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:10.976 A:middle
as do play now which
is automatch.

00:02:11.246 --> 00:02:14.366 A:middle
Some of you have
implemented GKMatchmaker

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.666 A:middle
which is our programmatic
API which allows you

00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:19.276 A:middle
to do your own UI and
set up your own invites.

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:22.056 A:middle
But if you've been using
GKMatchmakerViewController,

00:02:22.846 --> 00:02:25.116 A:middle
it now looks like this.

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:28.006 A:middle
This is our new integrated
Messages View Controller.

00:02:28.446 --> 00:02:30.296 A:middle
You'll notice some differences.

00:02:30.296 --> 00:02:33.416 A:middle
There's no bubbles but that's
not the most important part.

00:02:34.436 --> 00:02:37.496 A:middle
It now integrates
directly in with Messages

00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:40.866 A:middle
which will allow your users
to be able to send a message

00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:43.346 A:middle
to anyone in their
Contacts and then be able

00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:44.146 A:middle
to play a game with them.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.146 A:middle
So let's see what
this looks like.

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:49.736 A:middle
This is the Multiplayer View
Controller in Doodle Jump.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:50.636 A:middle
You can click Play Now

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:53.506 A:middle
and automatch will work
just as it has before.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.226 A:middle
However, we're more interested
in seeing what happens

00:02:56.226 --> 00:02:57.356 A:middle
when we click Invite Friends.

00:02:57.356 --> 00:03:01.596 A:middle
So that will bring in this
new Messages View Controller.

00:02:57.356 --> 00:03:01.596 A:middle
So that will bring in this
new Messages View Controller.

00:03:01.596 --> 00:03:03.936 A:middle
You can see we have this
beautiful rich link here

00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:04.426 A:middle
that we've got.

00:03:04.426 --> 00:03:06.646 A:middle
We've got the little Doodle
Jump icon in the corner.

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:09.846 A:middle
I added a little bit of text
that can tell your users

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:13.956 A:middle
about what this link is
going to let them do.

00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:16.636 A:middle
And this is all based on
iCloud technology so all

00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:18.256 A:middle
of your users will
need to be signed

00:03:18.256 --> 00:03:21.016 A:middle
into iCloud for this to work.

00:03:21.316 --> 00:03:23.536 A:middle
You can then start
typing in the To field.

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:27.326 A:middle
This will autocomplete to
Contacts or you can just type

00:03:27.326 --> 00:03:31.366 A:middle
in a email address or phone
number of anyone that you know

00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:33.916 A:middle
or anyone that you just met.

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:36.416 A:middle
Or you can click on that
Plus button which is going

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:37.896 A:middle
to bring in the Contacts.

00:03:38.056 --> 00:03:39.436 A:middle
So these are all my Contacts

00:03:39.676 --> 00:03:42.756 A:middle
that I have Messages
information for.

00:03:43.346 --> 00:03:45.506 A:middle
You'll also see that there's
a Recents tab in the middle.

00:03:45.506 --> 00:03:48.476 A:middle
That is where your Game Center
friends are going to be located

00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:51.946 A:middle
as well as anyone that your
users have recently played

00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:53.466 A:middle
on Game Center.

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:56.496 A:middle
And Nearby also functions the
same way that Nearby has worked

00:03:56.496 --> 00:04:00.056 A:middle
in that it will be looking
for players on local network

00:03:56.496 --> 00:04:00.056 A:middle
in that it will be looking
for players on local network

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:02.166 A:middle
that are also playing this game.

00:04:02.446 --> 00:04:04.326 A:middle
So I'm going to click on Alisha,

00:04:04.326 --> 00:04:05.826 A:middle
invite my friend,
Alisha, to play.

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:08.976 A:middle
And then we'll click Add
and it's going to fill her

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:10.446 A:middle
in into that To field.

00:04:12.116 --> 00:04:14.926 A:middle
You can then, this functions
just exactly as Messages.

00:04:14.926 --> 00:04:16.156 A:middle
This is basically Messages UI

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:18.546 A:middle
so you're users can
add additional text

00:04:18.546 --> 00:04:20.435 A:middle
and then it's going to
send to all the players.

00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:23.136 A:middle
If I clicked on a Game Center
player, their name is going

00:04:23.136 --> 00:04:25.866 A:middle
to show up in gray and
they will getting a Game

00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:26.756 A:middle
Center notification.

00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:27.636 A:middle
They're not going
to get some sort

00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:30.126 A:middle
of weird Game Center iMessage.

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:33.046 A:middle
It will come in as
a notification.

00:04:33.256 --> 00:04:37.966 A:middle
So if we click on that Send
button, then that will send it

00:04:38.026 --> 00:04:39.596 A:middle
to Alisha and this is
what it's going to look

00:04:39.596 --> 00:04:40.716 A:middle
like on Alisha's screen.

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:44.196 A:middle
She can then tap the link
to accept the invite,

00:04:44.196 --> 00:04:46.826 A:middle
and that will take her
directly into the game,

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:50.036 A:middle
and start connecting
just like it would have

00:04:50.036 --> 00:04:51.546 A:middle
if she had tapped
on the notification.

00:04:52.076 --> 00:04:53.906 A:middle
And the same functionality
we'll have

00:04:53.906 --> 00:04:56.766 A:middle
if she did not have Doodle
Jump, then it will take her

00:04:56.766 --> 00:05:00.016 A:middle
to the store where she can
then download and play just

00:04:56.766 --> 00:05:00.016 A:middle
to the store where she can
then download and play just

00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:01.966 A:middle
like she would be able
to from a notification.

00:05:02.286 --> 00:05:05.466 A:middle
Now I said that there's
nothing that you need to do

00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:07.096 A:middle
in order to implement this.

00:05:07.096 --> 00:05:09.666 A:middle
We have just replaced
the View Controller

00:05:09.666 --> 00:05:11.696 A:middle
so if you have been using
this View Controller,

00:05:12.026 --> 00:05:14.616 A:middle
then you've got this just
straight out of the box.

00:05:14.616 --> 00:05:17.896 A:middle
As soon as iOS 10 is shipped
all of your users will be able

00:05:17.896 --> 00:05:20.636 A:middle
to do this and invite
anyone that they know.

00:05:20.636 --> 00:05:23.176 A:middle
They will no longer be limited
to their Game Center friends.

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:25.926 A:middle
However, we have one thing
that you can customize

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:28.236 A:middle
if you would like, which
is this rich link image.

00:05:28.236 --> 00:05:30.516 A:middle
So you'll notice right here it's
the Game Center icon currently.

00:05:30.836 --> 00:05:33.256 A:middle
If you would like to change
that to be something else

00:05:33.386 --> 00:05:36.396 A:middle
that you feel more appropriately
represents your game,

00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:41.196 A:middle
or more appropriately indicates
that this is a gaming invite,

00:05:41.196 --> 00:05:44.896 A:middle
or a fun thing that people will
want to click on, then you can,

00:05:45.036 --> 00:05:47.836 A:middle
all you need to do
is add this file:

00:05:48.006 --> 00:05:49.746 A:middle
GKMessageInvite to your bundle.

00:05:49.746 --> 00:05:52.646 A:middle
And the same way that we will
just pull that out if you wanted

00:05:52.646 --> 00:05:55.776 A:middle
to customize your notification
sound, we'll just pull that out

00:05:55.776 --> 00:05:58.226 A:middle
and customize your rich link.

00:05:58.596 --> 00:06:00.616 A:middle
Notice this is the same
rich link technology

00:05:58.596 --> 00:06:00.616 A:middle
Notice this is the same
rich link technology

00:06:00.616 --> 00:06:02.836 A:middle
that is being used for
Safari and so it's used

00:06:02.836 --> 00:06:05.556 A:middle
to taking a wide
variety of images.

00:06:05.686 --> 00:06:08.036 A:middle
So what does this mean
for Game Center Friends?

00:06:08.606 --> 00:06:10.396 A:middle
Well, we don't need
friends anymore

00:06:10.396 --> 00:06:11.636 A:middle
because we can play with anyone.

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:14.256 A:middle
So we're freezing
the friends list.

00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:17.606 A:middle
But you will still
be able to see any

00:06:17.606 --> 00:06:19.366 A:middle
of the Game Center
friends that you have

00:06:19.366 --> 00:06:21.176 A:middle
in that Recents Player tab.

00:06:21.176 --> 00:06:23.356 A:middle
And you can still
pull the friends.

00:06:23.356 --> 00:06:24.266 A:middle
Friends still exists.

00:06:24.266 --> 00:06:25.186 A:middle
We're not deleting them.

00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:25.826 A:middle
They're still there.

00:06:26.206 --> 00:06:29.336 A:middle
But you won't be able
to send, receive,

00:06:29.336 --> 00:06:31.536 A:middle
or respond to any
more friend Requests.

00:06:31.536 --> 00:06:32.416 A:middle
And because of that,

00:06:32.416 --> 00:06:35.376 A:middle
GKFriendRequestCompose
ViewController is

00:06:35.376 --> 00:06:36.706 A:middle
now deprecated.

00:06:37.676 --> 00:06:40.686 A:middle
It wasn't really used
that much anyway.

00:06:40.686 --> 00:06:44.516 A:middle
So what does that mean
for the Game Center app?

00:06:44.836 --> 00:06:47.046 A:middle
Well, if you've downloaded
The Siege,

00:06:47.046 --> 00:06:49.406 A:middle
you might notice some changes.

00:06:49.406 --> 00:06:52.416 A:middle
Well, what is the Game
Center app used for?

00:06:52.416 --> 00:06:54.596 A:middle
In iOS 9 it was basically used

00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:56.536 A:middle
to manage your account,
manage your friends.

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:58.596 A:middle
You could browse
your games list.

00:06:58.736 --> 00:07:00.156 A:middle
You could look at
your leaderboards,

00:06:58.736 --> 00:07:00.156 A:middle
You could look at
your leaderboards,

00:07:00.376 --> 00:07:04.056 A:middle
check out your achievements,
view your challenges,

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:06.436 A:middle
send challenges, and
also view your turns.

00:07:07.316 --> 00:07:10.036 A:middle
Well, it turns out all of these
things you can basically do

00:07:10.036 --> 00:07:11.266 A:middle
in other places in the system

00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:13.136 A:middle
and more importantly,
in your app.

00:07:13.686 --> 00:07:19.216 A:middle
And so we have removed
the Game Center app.

00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:22.926 A:middle
So where did we do
all these things?

00:07:23.016 --> 00:07:25.016 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:07:25.246 --> 00:07:27.246 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:07:27.476 --> 00:07:29.776 A:middle
If you want to manage
your account,

00:07:29.776 --> 00:07:31.296 A:middle
you can do that in settings.

00:07:31.416 --> 00:07:32.836 A:middle
If you want to manage
your friends,

00:07:33.256 --> 00:07:34.656 A:middle
you can still do
that in settings.

00:07:34.786 --> 00:07:37.476 A:middle
If you want to browse your
games, we've got the App Store,

00:07:37.476 --> 00:07:39.136 A:middle
you can look at your
Home screen.

00:07:39.906 --> 00:07:42.606 A:middle
You view your leaderboards,
achievements, and challenges

00:07:42.606 --> 00:07:44.346 A:middle
from GKGameCenterViewController.

00:07:44.346 --> 00:07:46.536 A:middle
If you're not using
the View Controller,

00:07:46.536 --> 00:07:47.656 A:middle
you can also do your own UI.

00:07:48.196 --> 00:07:51.746 A:middle
If you're not presenting
challenges or leaderboards

00:07:51.746 --> 00:07:53.846 A:middle
and achievements in your
game, we strongly suggest

00:07:53.846 --> 00:07:54.986 A:middle
that you start doing that now.

00:07:55.426 --> 00:07:59.916 A:middle
And you can also view and take
your turns from GKMatchmaker,

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:02.426 A:middle
GKTurnBasedMatchmaker
ViewController.

00:08:03.206 --> 00:08:07.186 A:middle
So we've removed the app.

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:09.166 A:middle
Everything is really
available in other places and,

00:08:09.166 --> 00:08:11.176 A:middle
more importantly, in your app.

00:08:11.176 --> 00:08:13.766 A:middle
We would love our users to
spend, your users to spend,

00:08:13.766 --> 00:08:14.676 A:middle
more time in your app.

00:08:14.676 --> 00:08:16.336 A:middle
We've got the rest of the phone.

00:08:16.336 --> 00:08:17.646 A:middle
We don't need any
more of their time.

00:08:18.106 --> 00:08:21.956 A:middle
And so we've removed the app.

00:08:22.226 --> 00:08:24.436 A:middle
Now let's talk about Sessions.

00:08:24.436 --> 00:08:27.586 A:middle
This is our brand new
API and we're really,

00:08:27.586 --> 00:08:29.276 A:middle
really excited about this.

00:08:29.476 --> 00:08:32.106 A:middle
This is a brand new
way to multiplay.

00:08:33.556 --> 00:08:36.466 A:middle
So Game Center Multiplayer,
what does it look right now?

00:08:36.785 --> 00:08:39.166 A:middle
We basically have
our two main API's

00:08:39.166 --> 00:08:40.876 A:middle
with real-time and turn-based.

00:08:40.876 --> 00:08:45.576 A:middle
Real-time will connect
just two to four players.

00:08:45.576 --> 00:08:49.346 A:middle
Those connections will require
like an immediate handshake.

00:08:49.346 --> 00:08:51.156 A:middle
If anyone drops from
that connection,

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.506 A:middle
then that whole connection
will be lost.

00:08:53.876 --> 00:08:55.606 A:middle
You're just passing
data back and forth.

00:08:55.916 --> 00:08:58.566 A:middle
And as soon as that match is
over all of that data is gone.

00:08:59.256 --> 00:09:02.506 A:middle
Turn-based can connect
to 16 players.

00:08:59.256 --> 00:09:02.506 A:middle
Turn-based can connect
to 16 players.

00:09:02.916 --> 00:09:07.206 A:middle
We have a very formal
API for passing of turns

00:09:07.206 --> 00:09:10.816 A:middle
and also exchanges but
you kind of really have

00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:13.736 A:middle
to follow those rules and you
have to make sure your game

00:09:13.736 --> 00:09:14.996 A:middle
like fits within that structure.

00:09:15.276 --> 00:09:17.356 A:middle
And all games are stored
on the Game Center server

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:19.386 A:middle
until they are aged out.

00:09:19.866 --> 00:09:21.476 A:middle
So what is Sessions?

00:09:22.156 --> 00:09:24.876 A:middle
Sessions is our new
iCloud-based multiplayer.

00:09:25.176 --> 00:09:28.426 A:middle
So we have this great
generalized interface for saving

00:09:28.426 --> 00:09:29.416 A:middle
and sharing game data.

00:09:29.786 --> 00:09:32.796 A:middle
These are easily shareable
little instances of data

00:09:32.796 --> 00:09:34.636 A:middle
that people can share
with people

00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:36.376 A:middle
that they would like
to play with.

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:38.186 A:middle
It's a completely
flexible game structure.

00:09:38.186 --> 00:09:39.666 A:middle
We don't impose anything on you.

00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:42.116 A:middle
You can do whatever you want.

00:09:42.116 --> 00:09:45.336 A:middle
And we have really stable,
solid real-time streams

00:09:45.336 --> 00:09:46.796 A:middle
that you can set up
within these sessions.

00:09:47.256 --> 00:09:50.416 A:middle
And this is going to allow
you to play with anyone.

00:09:50.416 --> 00:09:52.716 A:middle
So what does a Session
look like?

00:09:53.376 --> 00:09:56.046 A:middle
So we have two main
items that we have.

00:09:56.286 --> 00:09:57.266 A:middle
We've got our game data.

00:09:57.266 --> 00:09:58.836 A:middle
It's probably one of the
more important parts.

00:09:59.386 --> 00:10:00.966 A:middle
But also equally
important is their players.

00:09:59.386 --> 00:10:00.966 A:middle
But also equally
important is their players.

00:10:01.046 --> 00:10:05.106 A:middle
And really this is all that
you need and all the basics

00:10:05.106 --> 00:10:07.286 A:middle
that you have to have
to have a session,

00:10:07.486 --> 00:10:08.746 A:middle
is a player and some game data.

00:10:08.886 --> 00:10:13.136 A:middle
You can have multiple players
which is useful if you would

00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:14.856 A:middle
like to play with other people.

00:10:14.856 --> 00:10:17.866 A:middle
We also have the ability to send
messages between those players.

00:10:17.866 --> 00:10:20.286 A:middle
These messages will come in
as Game Center notifications.

00:10:20.636 --> 00:10:23.236 A:middle
So you can have those messages
being passed back and forth

00:10:23.236 --> 00:10:25.786 A:middle
between players or multiple
players can send multiple

00:10:25.786 --> 00:10:28.046 A:middle
messages all at the same time.

00:10:28.746 --> 00:10:31.916 A:middle
Along with these messages we
have the ability to badge.

00:10:32.426 --> 00:10:34.956 A:middle
So you can send those messages
and also badge those players

00:10:35.046 --> 00:10:37.066 A:middle
to let them know that there's
something within your game,

00:10:37.066 --> 00:10:38.186 A:middle
something within that session,

00:10:38.186 --> 00:10:39.516 A:middle
that they might want
to take care of.

00:10:40.286 --> 00:10:44.196 A:middle
Now I only show four players
here but we can actually have

00:10:44.256 --> 00:10:48.516 A:middle
up to 100 players in a single
session which is a lot more

00:10:48.516 --> 00:10:49.876 A:middle
than we've been able
to have before.

00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:54.226 A:middle
And we can have multiple
different kinds of sessions.

00:10:54.226 --> 00:10:56.596 A:middle
So you can have small sessions
that have one or two players.

00:10:56.596 --> 00:10:59.556 A:middle
You can have four players,
100 players, seven players.

00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:02.426 A:middle
Those players can be
functionally grouped

00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:02.426 A:middle
Those players can be
functionally grouped

00:11:02.426 --> 00:11:03.446 A:middle
onto different teams.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.996 A:middle
And you can have all
of these sessions up

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.576 A:middle
and your player can be in
all of these different kinds

00:11:08.576 --> 00:11:11.286 A:middle
of sessions all at
the same time.

00:11:11.616 --> 00:11:14.456 A:middle
We also have real-time streams
so if you're in this session

00:11:14.456 --> 00:11:17.166 A:middle
and you would like to be able to
pass data quickly back and forth

00:11:17.166 --> 00:11:20.346 A:middle
between your different players,
then your players merely need

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:21.616 A:middle
to set their connection states

00:11:21.976 --> 00:11:24.656 A:middle
and we will be setting these
pipes up in the background

00:11:25.026 --> 00:11:26.856 A:middle
that will allow the
players to be able

00:11:26.946 --> 00:11:30.636 A:middle
to start communicating
with each other.

00:11:30.636 --> 00:11:34.906 A:middle
So, let's get into the
actual code, the actual API

00:11:35.316 --> 00:11:36.576 A:middle
of what makes up a session.

00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:38.216 A:middle
So we've got a couple
of classes.

00:11:38.316 --> 00:11:41.696 A:middle
We've got GKGameSession which
is going to allow your players

00:11:41.806 --> 00:11:43.676 A:middle
to basically interact
with that session data

00:11:43.676 --> 00:11:45.336 A:middle
as well as the other players.

00:11:45.646 --> 00:11:48.356 A:middle
We have GKCloudPlayer which
is a player in a session.

00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:50.966 A:middle
We have GKEventListener
which will help you know

00:11:50.966 --> 00:11:53.826 A:middle
when important things happen
on any of your sessions

00:11:53.826 --> 00:11:54.646 A:middle
that your players are in.

00:11:55.016 --> 00:11:57.386 A:middle
And we also have
GKGameSessionError

00:11:57.386 --> 00:12:00.056 A:middle
which will give you a little
bit more specific errors

00:11:57.386 --> 00:12:00.056 A:middle
which will give you a little
bit more specific errors

00:12:00.456 --> 00:12:04.556 A:middle
that you might encounter
when working with Sessions.

00:12:05.106 --> 00:12:07.666 A:middle
So let's talk about
GKGameSession.

00:12:08.546 --> 00:12:10.476 A:middle
So this is your main workhorse.

00:12:10.476 --> 00:12:12.056 A:middle
This is where almost
all of the work is going

00:12:12.056 --> 00:12:13.036 A:middle
to be done per session.

00:12:13.036 --> 00:12:15.106 A:middle
It allows you to do
basically everything.

00:12:15.106 --> 00:12:17.446 A:middle
You can create a
session, leave sessions,

00:12:17.446 --> 00:12:20.886 A:middle
load and store your game
data, share your sessions,

00:12:20.886 --> 00:12:23.666 A:middle
add your players, remove your
players, see who's playing,

00:12:23.696 --> 00:12:26.566 A:middle
send your notifications,
set and clear your badges,

00:12:26.876 --> 00:12:29.286 A:middle
join your streams, send
data on those streams.

00:12:29.286 --> 00:12:31.176 A:middle
Basically everything you're
going to be doing is going

00:12:31.176 --> 00:12:33.046 A:middle
to be interacting
with GKGameSession.

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:37.006 A:middle
Some more details about that.

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:39.506 A:middle
With your game data
you can store

00:12:39.506 --> 00:12:41.666 A:middle
up to 512 kilobytes of data.

00:12:42.176 --> 00:12:44.946 A:middle
This data is going to be
stored in the user's iCloud

00:12:44.946 --> 00:12:47.166 A:middle
so it's not something
associated with your game.

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:49.276 A:middle
And the user is going to
have it in their iCloud.

00:12:49.276 --> 00:12:51.936 A:middle
It will count against
their iCloud limits.

00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:54.546 A:middle
And it's going to follow
CloudKit conventions in terms

00:12:54.546 --> 00:12:57.506 A:middle
of who owns that data, how
the data is shared, privacy,

00:12:57.676 --> 00:13:00.506 A:middle
and what happens when
that data is deleted.

00:12:57.676 --> 00:13:00.506 A:middle
and what happens when
that data is deleted.

00:13:00.506 --> 00:13:02.046 A:middle
Messages and Badges,
as I've said,

00:13:02.046 --> 00:13:03.646 A:middle
come in as Game Center
notifications

00:13:03.646 --> 00:13:04.806 A:middle
and they're badged as such.

00:13:05.186 --> 00:13:08.116 A:middle
And badging is now going to
be more directly controlled

00:13:08.116 --> 00:13:09.296 A:middle
by you, as the developer.

00:13:10.336 --> 00:13:12.026 A:middle
We'll get into that a little
bit more but it's going

00:13:12.026 --> 00:13:13.866 A:middle
to be very clear where that
badge number is coming from

00:13:13.866 --> 00:13:17.036 A:middle
and you should be able to
understand why it is what it is

00:13:17.036 --> 00:13:21.776 A:middle
and change it to pretty
much whatever you want.

00:13:21.776 --> 00:13:24.456 A:middle
And we also have these
real-time streams

00:13:24.456 --> 00:13:26.906 A:middle
which basically leverage
existing Apple infrastructure.

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:29.566 A:middle
This is running on the same
technology that runs FaceTime

00:13:29.566 --> 00:13:31.596 A:middle
as well as iMessage
so it's really strong,

00:13:31.596 --> 00:13:34.396 A:middle
it's really stable, and it's
built to carry a lot of data.

00:13:34.866 --> 00:13:37.886 A:middle
So if we want to make a
session, what do we need to do?

00:13:38.326 --> 00:13:40.826 A:middle
Well, first we need a title,

00:13:40.996 --> 00:13:43.046 A:middle
something to describe
the session.

00:13:43.046 --> 00:13:45.416 A:middle
Either you can define that or
you can get that from your user.

00:13:45.856 --> 00:13:49.476 A:middle
You need your container ID
which your iCloud container

00:13:49.476 --> 00:13:50.876 A:middle
that you set up with your app.

00:13:51.026 --> 00:13:54.916 A:middle
And also set up a container that
can be used across multiple apps

00:13:55.136 --> 00:13:57.446 A:middle
so if you want multiple
games to be able to access

00:13:57.446 --> 00:13:59.926 A:middle
that same data, say if
you had your free version,

00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:02.496 A:middle
your pay version, or, you
know, other different kinds

00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:02.496 A:middle
your pay version, or, you
know, other different kinds

00:14:02.496 --> 00:14:04.706 A:middle
of versions of your
game, they will still,

00:14:04.706 --> 00:14:06.816 A:middle
if you set that up correctly,
they will still all be able

00:14:06.916 --> 00:14:09.456 A:middle
to access that same data.

00:14:09.996 --> 00:14:13.206 A:middle
And you can also set the max
number of streaming players.

00:14:13.376 --> 00:14:16.396 A:middle
There's a hard limit of
16 players that can be

00:14:16.396 --> 00:14:19.116 A:middle
in that real-time stream but
if you would like to make

00:14:19.116 --> 00:14:21.906 A:middle
that lower, or something
different, then you can lower

00:14:21.906 --> 00:14:24.426 A:middle
that when you create
the session but you need

00:14:24.426 --> 00:14:25.646 A:middle
to decide that when you create.

00:14:26.696 --> 00:14:31.126 A:middle
So once you've, so you just will
call createSessionInContainer

00:14:31.126 --> 00:14:32.536 A:middle
with all of that
relevant information

00:14:32.536 --> 00:14:34.606 A:middle
and that will give you a session

00:14:34.606 --> 00:14:37.386 A:middle
that you can start
manipulating and using.

00:14:38.376 --> 00:14:40.996 A:middle
One of the first things you're
probably going to want to do

00:14:40.996 --> 00:14:42.496 A:middle
with the session is
be able to figure how

00:14:42.496 --> 00:14:44.496 A:middle
to load and save your data.

00:14:44.496 --> 00:14:46.886 A:middle
Any player that's in a
session can access that data.

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:49.086 A:middle
It's just one big blob
that everybody plays with.

00:14:49.526 --> 00:14:51.906 A:middle
And there's a little
bit of metadata provided

00:14:51.906 --> 00:14:55.416 A:middle
with that session that will help
you avoid and resolve conflicts

00:14:55.666 --> 00:14:58.096 A:middle
which is last modified date
and last modified player.

00:14:58.096 --> 00:15:01.326 A:middle
So you'll know who was
touching it last and whether

00:14:58.096 --> 00:15:01.326 A:middle
So you'll know who was
touching it last and whether

00:15:01.326 --> 00:15:05.086 A:middle
or not it's important for you
to save or if your data is more

00:15:05.086 --> 00:15:05.856 A:middle
than likely up to date.

00:15:06.266 --> 00:15:08.416 A:middle
So you can just call
loadDataWithCompletionHandler,

00:15:08.416 --> 00:15:09.606 A:middle
that will pass you your data.

00:15:10.426 --> 00:15:13.506 A:middle
You'd also probably
like to save your data.

00:15:13.586 --> 00:15:15.526 A:middle
As I said before, 512 kilobytes

00:15:15.746 --> 00:15:18.936 A:middle
but you can do whatever
you want with that data.

00:15:18.936 --> 00:15:23.396 A:middle
It can be whatever
will fit in that size.

00:15:23.716 --> 00:15:26.786 A:middle
So you'll call saveData
with completionHandler.

00:15:26.816 --> 00:15:30.246 A:middle
If there is a conflict, if
someone else has tried to save

00:15:30.246 --> 00:15:33.846 A:middle
in the interim, you will get
an error and you will get

00:15:33.846 --> 00:15:34.896 A:middle
that conflicting data back.

00:15:34.896 --> 00:15:38.686 A:middle
And we'll talk a little bit
more about that in a second.

00:15:38.686 --> 00:15:41.606 A:middle
Anytime someone does save
data there's an Event Listener

00:15:41.606 --> 00:15:43.186 A:middle
that goes along with that.

00:15:43.186 --> 00:15:45.516 A:middle
So if you set up your
Event Listener to listen

00:15:45.516 --> 00:15:47.666 A:middle
for a session player to save
data, then you will know

00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:50.276 A:middle
when someone else has saved
data and you will know

00:15:50.276 --> 00:15:52.926 A:middle
that you will more than
likely will need to update

00:15:52.926 --> 00:15:55.746 A:middle
and resolve any conflicts
local you have with that data.

00:15:56.286 --> 00:16:00.316 A:middle
So as I said, Save
conflicts can occur.

00:15:56.286 --> 00:16:00.316 A:middle
So as I said, Save
conflicts can occur.

00:16:00.726 --> 00:16:03.276 A:middle
And this will happen where two
players who were basically going

00:16:03.276 --> 00:16:06.046 A:middle
to try to save data in
about the same time.

00:16:06.046 --> 00:16:09.916 A:middle
Since there's no real formal
turn passing it's very possible

00:16:09.916 --> 00:16:12.486 A:middle
that two players can be
taking a turn at the same time

00:16:12.486 --> 00:16:16.776 A:middle
if that's how you design
and implement your game.

00:16:16.776 --> 00:16:19.136 A:middle
So say we've got Players Two
and Three and they both try

00:16:19.136 --> 00:16:20.016 A:middle
to save at the same time.

00:16:20.016 --> 00:16:22.136 A:middle
Well, one of them is
going to win so I'm going

00:16:22.136 --> 00:16:22.956 A:middle
to say it's Player Two.

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:27.106 A:middle
That means when Player Three
tries to save they're going

00:16:27.106 --> 00:16:29.576 A:middle
to get an error and that
conflicted data will

00:16:29.576 --> 00:16:30.236 A:middle
be returned.

00:16:30.606 --> 00:16:33.746 A:middle
Now you are going to
need to figure out how

00:16:33.746 --> 00:16:35.106 A:middle
to resolve this conflict.

00:16:35.256 --> 00:16:38.106 A:middle
Since we have no
specific formalities

00:16:38.106 --> 00:16:41.416 A:middle
for what this data is we also
don't know what the data means.

00:16:41.536 --> 00:16:43.856 A:middle
And so it's going to be up
to you to architect your data

00:16:43.856 --> 00:16:46.646 A:middle
in such a way that it's going
to be easy for you to figure

00:16:46.646 --> 00:16:49.206 A:middle
out what those conflicts
are, resolve those conflicts,

00:16:49.206 --> 00:16:52.706 A:middle
and recall saved data in order

00:16:52.706 --> 00:16:54.356 A:middle
for that data to
actually be saved.

00:16:54.666 --> 00:16:58.336 A:middle
If you do not recall saved data,
your data will not be saved

00:16:58.336 --> 00:17:00.396 A:middle
and you need to continue
to call saved data

00:16:58.336 --> 00:17:00.396 A:middle
and you need to continue
to call saved data

00:17:00.666 --> 00:17:02.796 A:middle
until you return
without a conflict.

00:17:03.156 --> 00:17:06.906 A:middle
And then everything
will be up to date.

00:17:06.906 --> 00:17:10.146 A:middle
Everything will be the
same for all your users

00:17:10.146 --> 00:17:11.856 A:middle
and you can continue forward.

00:17:12.705 --> 00:17:18.356 A:middle
And then everything
will be grand.

00:17:18.836 --> 00:17:21.945 A:middle
We've talked about
having multiplayers, well,

00:17:21.945 --> 00:17:25.326 A:middle
how do you get additional
players into your session?

00:17:25.786 --> 00:17:28.936 A:middle
Any player that's in a session
can invite other players

00:17:28.936 --> 00:17:29.336 A:middle
to join.

00:17:29.796 --> 00:17:32.616 A:middle
Basically you're going
to be provided with a URL

00:17:32.616 --> 00:17:34.646 A:middle
that you need to
get to someone else.

00:17:34.646 --> 00:17:38.686 A:middle
You can send this via iMessage,
email, Twitter, Facebook,

00:17:38.756 --> 00:17:39.946 A:middle
print it out, paste
it on a tree --

00:17:39.946 --> 00:17:42.786 A:middle
that's probably not
the best way.

00:17:42.836 --> 00:17:45.226 A:middle
But as long as you can get
this URL to other people

00:17:45.546 --> 00:17:47.666 A:middle
and they can click on
it, then it will be able

00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:49.336 A:middle
to be added to that session.

00:17:49.686 --> 00:17:53.486 A:middle
The easiest way to do this
is through the share sheet

00:17:53.706 --> 00:17:55.596 A:middle
because it just pops
up right there

00:17:55.596 --> 00:17:57.216 A:middle
and you can send off a message.

00:17:57.456 --> 00:18:00.066 A:middle
And that's probably the
easiest way to do that.

00:17:57.456 --> 00:18:00.066 A:middle
And that's probably the
easiest way to do that.

00:18:00.066 --> 00:18:06.166 A:middle
So if like the Player One, if
they pull the URL from their,

00:18:06.166 --> 00:18:11.086 A:middle
from the session, they set up an
iMessage with that share sheet

00:18:11.456 --> 00:18:13.066 A:middle
to send to Player Two.

00:18:13.066 --> 00:18:14.736 A:middle
They've added a little
bit of text, "Hey,

00:18:14.736 --> 00:18:16.196 A:middle
want you want to play with me?"

00:18:16.196 --> 00:18:18.636 A:middle
It'll come out as
this iCloud URL.

00:18:18.996 --> 00:18:22.216 A:middle
It will be sent to Player
Two, they will click on it,

00:18:22.216 --> 00:18:25.456 A:middle
and as soon as they click
on it Player Two is added.

00:18:25.456 --> 00:18:28.896 A:middle
So in order to get the URL
you just call getShareURLWith

00:18:28.896 --> 00:18:29.546 A:middle
CompletionHandler.

00:18:29.546 --> 00:18:30.736 A:middle
It will give you the URL

00:18:30.736 --> 00:18:32.246 A:middle
that you can then do
whatever you want with.

00:18:32.726 --> 00:18:36.476 A:middle
And then anytime
a player is added

00:18:36.556 --> 00:18:40.946 A:middle
to a session the Event Listener
didAddPlayer will be called.

00:18:41.276 --> 00:18:42.696 A:middle
And that will let you know

00:18:42.696 --> 00:18:45.466 A:middle
that someone else has joined
your session and be able

00:18:45.546 --> 00:18:48.396 A:middle
to proceed with your
game accordingly.

00:18:48.826 --> 00:18:50.446 A:middle
So we've been talking
about players

00:18:50.506 --> 00:18:53.256 A:middle
so what exactly are they?

00:18:53.566 --> 00:18:55.076 A:middle
Well, we've got GKCloudPlayer.

00:18:55.466 --> 00:18:58.206 A:middle
This is different
than the GK Players

00:18:58.206 --> 00:18:59.696 A:middle
that you've been
dealing with before.

00:18:59.846 --> 00:19:03.746 A:middle
GKCloudPlayer is only for,
to be used for Sessions.

00:18:59.846 --> 00:19:03.746 A:middle
GKCloudPlayer is only for,
to be used for Sessions.

00:19:04.326 --> 00:19:08.426 A:middle
It basically has two pieces of
data, a player ID that is unique

00:19:08.466 --> 00:19:11.396 A:middle
to your app as well
as the display name,

00:19:11.666 --> 00:19:16.266 A:middle
that is what the user will have

00:19:16.266 --> 00:19:18.176 A:middle
as what they want they
name to be displayed.

00:19:18.636 --> 00:19:21.496 A:middle
This is not a GKPlayer
object at all.

00:19:21.716 --> 00:19:24.206 A:middle
If you try to use this for a
leaderboard, for achievements,

00:19:24.206 --> 00:19:27.686 A:middle
for other multiplayer, for
anything else, it will not work.

00:19:27.756 --> 00:19:28.846 A:middle
So please don't do that.

00:19:29.146 --> 00:19:31.456 A:middle
Everyone will be
very disappointed.

00:19:31.926 --> 00:19:35.706 A:middle
So how do we get
our Cloud Players?

00:19:36.996 --> 00:19:39.356 A:middle
Basically you can get your
current signed in player.

00:19:39.516 --> 00:19:42.766 A:middle
Most of the things in Sessions
basically are going to be called

00:19:42.846 --> 00:19:45.976 A:middle
from your current player though
there's not a whole lot of need

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:47.246 A:middle
to make sure that
you have the player,

00:19:47.246 --> 00:19:48.216 A:middle
that you are then saying, "Oh,

00:19:48.316 --> 00:19:49.876 A:middle
this player is saving
this data."

00:19:50.326 --> 00:19:52.426 A:middle
All that's handled for
you in the background.

00:19:52.636 --> 00:19:55.446 A:middle
But you might be
interested to know basically

00:19:55.446 --> 00:19:56.566 A:middle
like who owns this session?

00:19:56.606 --> 00:19:59.606 A:middle
So you might want to know if
the session is being deleted,

00:19:59.846 --> 00:20:00.786 A:middle
if other player owns it,

00:19:59.846 --> 00:20:00.786 A:middle
if other player owns it,

00:20:00.786 --> 00:20:01.976 A:middle
then that will delete the
data for everyone else.

00:20:02.046 --> 00:20:06.326 A:middle
And you also might want to
be able to clear your badges,

00:20:06.356 --> 00:20:10.186 A:middle
send messages, be a
little more aware of that.

00:20:10.186 --> 00:20:11.916 A:middle
You can also get any of
the other players that are

00:20:11.916 --> 00:20:14.876 A:middle
in the session, it's just
a property on that session.

00:20:15.096 --> 00:20:18.306 A:middle
And that's the best way that
you're going to need to be able

00:20:18.306 --> 00:20:19.946 A:middle
to send those messages
to those other players,

00:20:20.226 --> 00:20:22.126 A:middle
especially setting
and clearing badges.

00:20:22.516 --> 00:20:27.886 A:middle
So speaking of messages and
badges, let's talk about that.

00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:31.526 A:middle
These messages, we say
messages but they're coming

00:20:31.526 --> 00:20:32.826 A:middle
in as Game Center notifications.

00:20:33.386 --> 00:20:35.596 A:middle
As I said before, all
players can send messages

00:20:35.596 --> 00:20:37.146 A:middle
at any time to any other player.

00:20:37.206 --> 00:20:39.146 A:middle
Those messages are
easily localizable.

00:20:39.476 --> 00:20:43.136 A:middle
You can also send a little bit
of data along with that message

00:20:43.136 --> 00:20:47.676 A:middle
if there's any sort of relevant
information that you might want

00:20:47.676 --> 00:20:50.296 A:middle
to pass to the other players
about what this message is about

00:20:50.296 --> 00:20:53.286 A:middle
or what they might want to
be looking at specifically.

00:20:53.766 --> 00:20:58.136 A:middle
And you can also optionally
badge the message recipient

00:20:58.206 --> 00:21:01.176 A:middle
so anyone that gets this
message can also receive a badge

00:20:58.206 --> 00:21:01.176 A:middle
so anyone that gets this
message can also receive a badge

00:21:01.506 --> 00:21:03.176 A:middle
as well as that message.

00:21:03.366 --> 00:21:05.746 A:middle
So what does the code look like?

00:21:06.176 --> 00:21:08.366 A:middle
sendMessageWithLocalizedKey.

00:21:08.366 --> 00:21:10.826 A:middle
You've got all these arguments,
who to send it to, whether

00:21:10.826 --> 00:21:12.366 A:middle
or not you would like
to badge those players.

00:21:12.606 --> 00:21:15.556 A:middle
And the Event Listener
that is called is session

00:21:15.556 --> 00:21:17.646 A:middle
didReceiveMessage fromPlayer.

00:21:17.886 --> 00:21:21.416 A:middle
And that will be called any
time a notification comes

00:21:21.416 --> 00:21:25.626 A:middle
in to let the player know
that something has come

00:21:25.626 --> 00:21:27.866 A:middle
in that they might
want to be aware of

00:21:27.866 --> 00:21:30.376 A:middle
or might want to deal with.

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:32.236 A:middle
And badges.

00:21:32.696 --> 00:21:35.656 A:middle
So I've said badges can be
included with these messages.

00:21:36.026 --> 00:21:41.316 A:middle
So basically anytime you send a
message you can basically turn

00:21:41.556 --> 00:21:43.966 A:middle
that badge state
on for that player.

00:21:44.226 --> 00:21:48.586 A:middle
You've got one badge per
session so basically it means

00:21:48.586 --> 00:21:51.346 A:middle
like there's something you need
to deal with or there's not.

00:21:51.346 --> 00:21:56.456 A:middle
And these badges can be set
and cleared at any time.

00:21:56.456 --> 00:21:59.936 A:middle
So if you send a message
and then you're like, "Hey,

00:21:59.936 --> 00:22:02.726 A:middle
I need some help with this thing
that we're doing in the game,"

00:21:59.936 --> 00:22:02.726 A:middle
I need some help with this thing
that we're doing in the game,"

00:22:02.726 --> 00:22:05.246 A:middle
and then no one shows
up you can, you know,

00:22:05.246 --> 00:22:07.146 A:middle
clear those badges and
be like, "Never mind.

00:22:07.146 --> 00:22:10.146 A:middle
I didn't want to
talk to you anyway."

00:22:10.146 --> 00:22:11.596 A:middle
And so that you can keep all

00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:13.916 A:middle
of that badge data
relevant and up to date.

00:22:14.296 --> 00:22:17.306 A:middle
The app icon will
show the overall tally

00:22:17.306 --> 00:22:20.326 A:middle
so if you've got three sessions
and all of them are badges,

00:22:20.326 --> 00:22:22.226 A:middle
that app icon will say three.

00:22:22.636 --> 00:22:24.546 A:middle
If you have one, you know,

00:22:24.546 --> 00:22:26.816 A:middle
only one of them is
badge, it will say one.

00:22:26.816 --> 00:22:30.496 A:middle
We could aggregate that for
you but based off of the,

00:22:30.496 --> 00:22:32.886 A:middle
what is set in that session
it should be very clear

00:22:33.106 --> 00:22:34.556 A:middle
where that badge
number is coming from.

00:22:35.096 --> 00:22:39.976 A:middle
So let's talk about
managing these sessions.

00:22:40.546 --> 00:22:42.596 A:middle
So we've made a session.

00:22:42.596 --> 00:22:43.396 A:middle
We've saved it.

00:22:43.396 --> 00:22:44.456 A:middle
We've loaded it.

00:22:44.456 --> 00:22:46.296 A:middle
We've loaded the data.

00:22:46.296 --> 00:22:49.036 A:middle
We've sent it to some players.

00:22:49.036 --> 00:22:52.556 A:middle
Your user has turned
off your app.

00:22:53.226 --> 00:22:54.726 A:middle
They've done some other things.

00:22:54.726 --> 00:22:55.996 A:middle
You've come back.

00:22:55.996 --> 00:22:58.466 A:middle
You want to load those
sessions and make sure

00:22:58.466 --> 00:23:00.306 A:middle
that you've got all
the relevant data

00:22:58.466 --> 00:23:00.306 A:middle
that you've got all
the relevant data

00:23:00.306 --> 00:23:01.946 A:middle
so that they can
start playing again.

00:23:02.826 --> 00:23:06.466 A:middle
So the first thing you'll
want to call is Load Sessions.

00:23:06.956 --> 00:23:08.796 A:middle
loadSessionsInContainer,
that container,

00:23:08.796 --> 00:23:10.646 A:middle
that same app container
from the beginning

00:23:10.646 --> 00:23:11.816 A:middle
that you made the session in.

00:23:11.866 --> 00:23:15.826 A:middle
This will load the bare bones
information for all the sessions

00:23:15.826 --> 00:23:18.676 A:middle
that your local player
is a part of.

00:23:18.996 --> 00:23:23.476 A:middle
Then based off of that data
you're going to want to look

00:23:23.476 --> 00:23:25.706 A:middle
and figure out which session
you're going to want to load.

00:23:25.976 --> 00:23:29.336 A:middle
That session has two main
pieces to identify it.

00:23:29.336 --> 00:23:32.436 A:middle
One is that title that you gave
us but the title is not unique.

00:23:32.486 --> 00:23:34.366 A:middle
You can make it anything
that you want.

00:23:34.886 --> 00:23:39.066 A:middle
And so that's not enough to be
able to just load a session.

00:23:39.346 --> 00:23:42.896 A:middle
Upon creation of a session we
will give you an identifier

00:23:43.116 --> 00:23:45.946 A:middle
and that is what you will
need to use in order to load

00:23:45.946 --> 00:23:46.976 A:middle
that specific session.

00:23:47.316 --> 00:23:49.516 A:middle
Call loadSessionWithIdentifier

00:23:49.836 --> 00:23:51.536 A:middle
and that will give you
all the information

00:23:51.536 --> 00:23:53.836 A:middle
for the session including
everything that you will need

00:23:53.836 --> 00:23:57.826 A:middle
to do in order to start loading
that data, sending messages

00:23:57.826 --> 00:24:01.636 A:middle
to other players, and
continuing on with your game.

00:23:57.826 --> 00:24:01.636 A:middle
to other players, and
continuing on with your game.

00:24:01.746 --> 00:24:03.916 A:middle
You also might want
to delete a session.

00:24:04.696 --> 00:24:07.176 A:middle
If you call
removeSessionWithIdentifier,

00:24:07.176 --> 00:24:10.256 A:middle
that's the same identifier
that we just talked about,

00:24:10.256 --> 00:24:13.446 A:middle
if the player does
not own the session,

00:24:13.446 --> 00:24:15.836 A:middle
it will merely remove
them from the session.

00:24:16.046 --> 00:24:18.266 A:middle
It will not actually
delete any of that data.

00:24:18.696 --> 00:24:21.406 A:middle
However, if you're
deleting a session

00:24:22.316 --> 00:24:27.436 A:middle
that that player created,
then it will delete that data,

00:24:27.486 --> 00:24:28.586 A:middle
not only for that player,

00:24:28.586 --> 00:24:30.646 A:middle
but for everyone
else in that session.

00:24:30.646 --> 00:24:32.246 A:middle
And that may be one
of those times

00:24:32.246 --> 00:24:36.356 A:middle
that who your local player is,
figure out if they are going

00:24:36.356 --> 00:24:41.186 A:middle
to be doing that to
everyone, and maybe send,

00:24:41.186 --> 00:24:43.356 A:middle
alert the user that,
"Hey, you're deleting this

00:24:43.356 --> 00:24:46.916 A:middle
for everyone," so that they
know what they're doing.

00:24:47.706 --> 00:24:52.356 A:middle
At any time a player is removed
the Event Listener will be

00:24:52.356 --> 00:24:54.806 A:middle
called didRemovePlayer
so that you'll know

00:24:54.806 --> 00:24:57.716 A:middle
that someone has left
and that you can continue

00:24:57.716 --> 00:24:59.356 A:middle
to update your game accordingly.

00:24:59.756 --> 00:25:04.116 A:middle
So let's talk about
Game Session Streams.

00:24:59.756 --> 00:25:04.116 A:middle
So let's talk about
Game Session Streams.

00:25:04.116 --> 00:25:06.196 A:middle
So this is the real-time
element of Sessions.

00:25:06.196 --> 00:25:07.786 A:middle
Everything else up until
this point has kind

00:25:07.786 --> 00:25:09.096 A:middle
of sound pretty turn-based.

00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:10.196 A:middle
You're saving.

00:25:10.196 --> 00:25:12.046 A:middle
You're passing messages.

00:25:12.196 --> 00:25:16.326 A:middle
We also have the ability to have
real-time elements to your game.

00:25:16.646 --> 00:25:20.216 A:middle
So Game Session Streams, you are
going to be able to connect any

00:25:20.216 --> 00:25:21.946 A:middle
of the players that are
currently in that session.

00:25:21.946 --> 00:25:23.656 A:middle
So everyone who is in that
session, if they would

00:25:23.656 --> 00:25:25.566 A:middle
like to start sending
data to each other,

00:25:25.806 --> 00:25:27.046 A:middle
that is how you're
going to do it.

00:25:27.546 --> 00:25:30.676 A:middle
You can basically see the
status of any other players

00:25:30.676 --> 00:25:32.646 A:middle
that are in the session.

00:25:33.236 --> 00:25:35.446 A:middle
You can send data to
all the players that are

00:25:35.446 --> 00:25:37.996 A:middle
in the connection
that you've set up.

00:25:37.996 --> 00:25:40.916 A:middle
And you will be able to add
and drop players at any time

00:25:40.916 --> 00:25:42.506 A:middle
without having to
restart that connection.

00:25:42.566 --> 00:25:46.186 A:middle
So you can someone join in and
like two people can be playing,

00:25:46.466 --> 00:25:48.166 A:middle
third person wants to come
in and join, you don't have

00:25:48.206 --> 00:25:49.766 A:middle
to reset everything up.

00:25:49.986 --> 00:25:52.306 A:middle
As soon as they start
they'll start receiving data.

00:25:52.306 --> 00:25:53.356 A:middle
They can start sending data.

00:25:53.356 --> 00:25:55.716 A:middle
You don't have to do any
handshakes for handling all

00:25:55.716 --> 00:25:56.936 A:middle
of that in the background
for you.

00:25:56.936 --> 00:26:01.136 A:middle
So how do we set
these connections up?

00:25:56.936 --> 00:26:01.136 A:middle
So how do we set
these connections up?

00:26:01.236 --> 00:26:02.756 A:middle
Basically you just need

00:26:02.756 --> 00:26:04.566 A:middle
to set the connection
state for that player.

00:26:05.006 --> 00:26:07.096 A:middle
So you would just call
setConnectionState

00:26:07.096 --> 00:26:08.756 A:middle
with completionHandler.

00:26:08.756 --> 00:26:11.846 A:middle
This can fail for a
number of reasons but one

00:26:11.846 --> 00:26:14.846 A:middle
of the reasons could
be if the max players

00:26:15.236 --> 00:26:16.696 A:middle
for that session has
already been reached.

00:26:16.696 --> 00:26:19.136 A:middle
So if this is the 17th
player who is trying to join

00:26:19.136 --> 00:26:21.966 A:middle
that stream and you've
got that max 17 set,

00:26:22.446 --> 00:26:27.276 A:middle
then this will actually fail
and they won't actually be able

00:26:27.276 --> 00:26:28.036 A:middle
to join into the stream.

00:26:28.036 --> 00:26:30.996 A:middle
You can see whether the players
are set with a specific state,

00:26:30.996 --> 00:26:33.436 A:middle
basically the states are
connected and disconnected

00:26:33.436 --> 00:26:35.796 A:middle
so you can see how many other
players are currently connected

00:26:35.796 --> 00:26:36.536 A:middle
and who they are.

00:26:36.946 --> 00:26:41.796 A:middle
And anytime a player either
changes that connection state,

00:26:41.796 --> 00:26:43.186 A:middle
either connects or disconnects,

00:26:43.186 --> 00:26:47.016 A:middle
the Event Listener session
player didChangeConnectionState

00:26:47.296 --> 00:26:48.266 A:middle
will be called.

00:26:48.696 --> 00:26:53.886 A:middle
And so you can know whether
or not that is changed

00:26:53.886 --> 00:26:56.376 A:middle
and how many people you
are currently playing with.

00:26:56.796 --> 00:26:58.856 A:middle
Once you set up the connection
then you're going to want

00:26:58.856 --> 00:27:00.156 A:middle
to probably start sending data.

00:26:58.856 --> 00:27:00.156 A:middle
to probably start sending data.

00:27:01.096 --> 00:27:03.836 A:middle
So all of the data is
going to be sent to all

00:27:03.836 --> 00:27:04.906 A:middle
of the connected players.

00:27:05.046 --> 00:27:07.286 A:middle
You can send this either
reliably or unreliably,

00:27:07.536 --> 00:27:10.946 A:middle
just the same as our
real-time API now.

00:27:11.266 --> 00:27:13.996 A:middle
Whether or not it's more
important to make sure

00:27:13.996 --> 00:27:16.646 A:middle
that those players get that data
or more important to make sure

00:27:16.946 --> 00:27:19.446 A:middle
that they're getting the
data as fast as possible.

00:27:19.756 --> 00:27:24.296 A:middle
And any time data is
sent the Event Listener

00:27:24.296 --> 00:27:28.346 A:middle
didReceiveDataFromPlayer will be
called and you'll be able to get

00:27:28.346 --> 00:27:33.946 A:middle
that data and update your
game locally, and continue

00:27:33.946 --> 00:27:37.206 A:middle
on with playing your game.

00:27:38.056 --> 00:27:42.936 A:middle
So that's all like the basic
bones of what makes up sessions.

00:27:43.486 --> 00:27:45.056 A:middle
So let's talk about
some examples

00:27:45.056 --> 00:27:46.696 A:middle
of what this actually
really looks

00:27:46.736 --> 00:27:50.326 A:middle
like when you're
actually making a game.

00:27:50.526 --> 00:27:52.716 A:middle
So first basically
you've got, you know,

00:27:52.716 --> 00:27:54.876 A:middle
your basic turn-based game.

00:27:55.136 --> 00:27:56.656 A:middle
So you've set up your session.

00:27:56.656 --> 00:27:57.646 A:middle
You've got your game data.

00:27:57.646 --> 00:27:59.026 A:middle
You've added a few players.

00:27:59.916 --> 00:28:01.346 A:middle
Maybe it's Player One's turn.

00:27:59.916 --> 00:28:01.346 A:middle
Maybe it's Player One's turn.

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.776 A:middle
They're going to start by
figuring out what their turn is

00:28:03.776 --> 00:28:04.876 A:middle
and they're going
to save that data.

00:28:05.036 --> 00:28:08.566 A:middle
That data can then be loaded by
Players Two, Three, and Four.

00:28:08.566 --> 00:28:12.136 A:middle
Message Player One can then
send a message to Player Two,

00:28:12.426 --> 00:28:13.686 A:middle
sending it that badge
and saying,

00:28:13.686 --> 00:28:14.816 A:middle
"Hey, it's your turn now."

00:28:15.056 --> 00:28:16.876 A:middle
Maybe you would like to do that.

00:28:16.946 --> 00:28:19.496 A:middle
Player Two can load up
their game, start playing,

00:28:19.496 --> 00:28:22.626 A:middle
figure out what they would
want to do with that new data,

00:28:23.106 --> 00:28:25.876 A:middle
take their turn, save that data,

00:28:25.876 --> 00:28:29.146 A:middle
and then pass the turn
on to Player Four.

00:28:29.846 --> 00:28:31.996 A:middle
Since there is no specified way

00:28:31.996 --> 00:28:33.926 A:middle
in which these turns can
be passed that's up to you.

00:28:33.926 --> 00:28:36.726 A:middle
You can pass it from One
to Two, Two to Three,

00:28:37.066 --> 00:28:39.066 A:middle
Four to One, whatever you want.

00:28:39.066 --> 00:28:41.336 A:middle
There is no specified way

00:28:41.336 --> 00:28:44.516 A:middle
in which these turns can
be passed and, frankly,

00:28:44.516 --> 00:28:45.826 A:middle
we don't know what you're doing.

00:28:47.676 --> 00:28:49.946 A:middle
So you pass the game
on to Player Four.

00:28:49.946 --> 00:28:52.116 A:middle
They get to take their
turn and continue on.

00:28:52.116 --> 00:28:54.776 A:middle
So you've got all the
elements that you need

00:28:54.776 --> 00:28:56.436 A:middle
for a really basic
turn-based game.

00:28:56.556 --> 00:28:59.686 A:middle
You can also do a
real-time game.

00:29:00.156 --> 00:29:02.936 A:middle
So you've got all of
your players set up.

00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:06.496 A:middle
You can then basically
have everyone turn

00:29:06.496 --> 00:29:07.606 A:middle
on their connection states.

00:29:07.606 --> 00:29:10.376 A:middle
As soon as these connection
states are turned on we will set

00:29:10.376 --> 00:29:12.516 A:middle
up the pipes in the
background to allow them

00:29:12.516 --> 00:29:13.816 A:middle
to communicate with each other.

00:29:14.276 --> 00:29:15.916 A:middle
And as soon as all
of those are set

00:29:15.916 --> 00:29:18.766 A:middle
up then your players can start
sending data to everyone else.

00:29:19.176 --> 00:29:23.426 A:middle
And then this data will
be just sent as long

00:29:23.426 --> 00:29:24.996 A:middle
as these connections
are available.

00:29:25.536 --> 00:29:28.236 A:middle
And then with sessions,
if there's any sort

00:29:28.236 --> 00:29:30.286 A:middle
of information you would like
to be able to store at the end,

00:29:30.506 --> 00:29:33.566 A:middle
such as, you know,
who won, or rankings,

00:29:33.566 --> 00:29:36.316 A:middle
or anything for this
particular real-time game,

00:29:36.316 --> 00:29:38.536 A:middle
you do have that ability
to have a little bit more

00:29:38.536 --> 00:29:40.756 A:middle
of a persistent data
that you might want

00:29:40.756 --> 00:29:41.766 A:middle
to save with that session.

00:29:42.946 --> 00:29:46.146 A:middle
So those are your
real basic examples.

00:29:46.626 --> 00:29:49.866 A:middle
But the real power session
comes in in being able

00:29:49.916 --> 00:29:51.906 A:middle
to do much more complicated
games.

00:29:52.826 --> 00:29:55.466 A:middle
So say you've got
a game session.

00:29:55.616 --> 00:29:58.356 A:middle
It's a turn-based game but you
want to do a little bit more

00:29:58.356 --> 00:29:59.446 A:middle
of a complicated turn.

00:29:59.446 --> 00:29:59.966 A:middle
They've got a game.

00:30:01.046 --> 00:30:04.306 A:middle
It's got some trading
card elements

00:30:04.626 --> 00:30:06.656 A:middle
so when it's the player's
turn you might be able

00:30:06.756 --> 00:30:09.946 A:middle
to trade cards, maybe brick
for sheep or something.

00:30:10.416 --> 00:30:15.746 A:middle
And so the things that you
might be able to accomplish

00:30:15.746 --> 00:30:21.386 A:middle
with table talk on an actual
board game you can now more

00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:22.776 A:middle
easily accomplish with sessions.

00:30:23.296 --> 00:30:26.786 A:middle
So say it's Player One's
turn and they want to trade

00:30:26.966 --> 00:30:29.856 A:middle
with the other players and so
they send out a message and say,

00:30:29.856 --> 00:30:32.516 A:middle
"Hey, I'd like trade
brick for sheep.

00:30:32.926 --> 00:30:33.756 A:middle
Anyone interested?"

00:30:33.966 --> 00:30:35.516 A:middle
So you can send that message.

00:30:35.516 --> 00:30:37.466 A:middle
You can send a little bit
of data with that message

00:30:37.466 --> 00:30:40.126 A:middle
to let the users know,
"Hey, this is what I want,"

00:30:40.126 --> 00:30:41.136 A:middle
and send it out to everyone.

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:42.526 A:middle
Say Player Four is
like, "Oh, yeah.

00:30:42.526 --> 00:30:43.406 A:middle
That sounds really good.

00:30:43.606 --> 00:30:46.566 A:middle
You know, I'll take that trade,"
or, "Yeah, well, you know,

00:30:46.666 --> 00:30:47.636 A:middle
that doesn't work for me.

00:30:47.636 --> 00:30:48.856 A:middle
How about wheat for sheep?"

00:30:48.856 --> 00:30:49.486 A:middle
or something else.

00:30:50.076 --> 00:30:53.056 A:middle
So they can send a message back
to Player One, badging them

00:30:53.056 --> 00:30:56.726 A:middle
and saying, "Hey, this is, I
either, I'll accept your trade

00:30:56.726 --> 00:30:57.536 A:middle
or I have a different trade."

00:30:57.536 --> 00:30:59.426 A:middle
You can send that
message back and forth,

00:30:59.646 --> 00:31:00.856 A:middle
figure out what you want to do.

00:30:59.646 --> 00:31:00.856 A:middle
figure out what you want to do.

00:31:00.856 --> 00:31:02.456 A:middle
As soon as Player
One decides, "Okay.

00:31:02.456 --> 00:31:04.256 A:middle
Well, I'll take that trade,"
or, "I won't take that trade,"

00:31:04.446 --> 00:31:07.486 A:middle
they can their turn,
unbadge everyone else,

00:31:08.236 --> 00:31:10.866 A:middle
and save their data,
unbadge themselves,

00:31:11.196 --> 00:31:15.966 A:middle
and then pass the
turn on to Player Two.

00:31:16.216 --> 00:31:21.956 A:middle
We also have the ability
to more easily join

00:31:21.956 --> 00:31:24.456 A:middle
into multiplayer games

00:31:24.456 --> 00:31:26.166 A:middle
that might be a little
bit more complicated.

00:31:26.366 --> 00:31:29.976 A:middle
So say you've got a multiplayer
game that's a little bit more

00:31:29.976 --> 00:31:31.116 A:middle
like a King of the
Hill type stuff.

00:31:31.116 --> 00:31:33.256 A:middle
You've got all these people in
session but you only want two

00:31:33.256 --> 00:31:35.496 A:middle
of them to be able
to play at a time.

00:31:35.496 --> 00:31:36.786 A:middle
So you're going to
start up your session.

00:31:36.786 --> 00:31:37.836 A:middle
You've got Players One and Two.

00:31:37.836 --> 00:31:39.086 A:middle
They're going to turn on
their connection state.

00:31:39.376 --> 00:31:41.106 A:middle
They're going to join into
a game and they're going

00:31:41.106 --> 00:31:42.256 A:middle
to pass their data
back and forth.

00:31:42.256 --> 00:31:44.166 A:middle
They're going to have
a little head-to-head,

00:31:44.166 --> 00:31:46.956 A:middle
a little one-on-one, and fight.

00:31:46.956 --> 00:31:50.346 A:middle
And one of those players
will be eliminated.

00:31:50.576 --> 00:31:53.976 A:middle
In this case let's
say Player One.

00:31:54.726 --> 00:31:58.286 A:middle
And then Player Two
will go on and then play

00:31:58.286 --> 00:32:00.276 A:middle
with the next person in line.

00:31:58.286 --> 00:32:00.276 A:middle
with the next person in line.

00:32:00.276 --> 00:32:02.436 A:middle
You don't have to stop
your game in any way.

00:32:02.436 --> 00:32:04.586 A:middle
You don't have to set up any
sort of connection screen.

00:32:04.966 --> 00:32:08.566 A:middle
As soon as Player Three sets
their connection state then you

00:32:08.566 --> 00:32:11.046 A:middle
can start sending that data
back and forth to Players Two

00:32:11.046 --> 00:32:14.366 A:middle
and Three immediately
and they will be able

00:32:14.466 --> 00:32:16.886 A:middle
to have their little
bout, see who wins.

00:32:17.316 --> 00:32:22.306 A:middle
This time [inaudible] and
then Player Four can then come

00:32:22.306 --> 00:32:23.386 A:middle
in and join in the fray.

00:32:23.666 --> 00:32:26.466 A:middle
They can make that
connection and continue on.

00:32:26.466 --> 00:32:28.066 A:middle
And you can continue
on with this,

00:32:28.416 --> 00:32:31.396 A:middle
continuing to do any
sort of round-robin.

00:32:31.396 --> 00:32:32.546 A:middle
If you've got like 100 players,

00:32:32.546 --> 00:32:34.016 A:middle
you can go through
all 100 players.

00:32:34.366 --> 00:32:36.496 A:middle
And just continue to
have a little King

00:32:36.496 --> 00:32:38.166 A:middle
of the Hill style fight.

00:32:38.286 --> 00:32:40.566 A:middle
And then you can store
that data to your game data

00:32:40.956 --> 00:32:45.366 A:middle
that will allow to have a little
bit more persistent rankings

00:32:45.366 --> 00:32:48.346 A:middle
and a little bit more persistent
[inaudible] among the people

00:32:48.346 --> 00:32:49.326 A:middle
that are in this session.

00:32:50.886 --> 00:32:53.036 A:middle
Another situation
that we might run

00:32:53.036 --> 00:32:55.586 A:middle
into is assisted single player.

00:32:55.806 --> 00:32:58.686 A:middle
So say you've got a
single player game.

00:32:58.686 --> 00:33:00.706 A:middle
You're using Sessions to
basically store your data

00:32:58.686 --> 00:33:00.706 A:middle
You're using Sessions to
basically store your data

00:33:01.096 --> 00:33:02.246 A:middle
which is totally fine.

00:33:02.246 --> 00:33:04.676 A:middle
You can absolutely do a single
player game with Sessions

00:33:04.956 --> 00:33:08.406 A:middle
and basically use this as
a way to store your data

00:33:08.626 --> 00:33:12.476 A:middle
and send your data so that all
of your data can be updated

00:33:12.476 --> 00:33:14.776 A:middle
across all of your
devices very easily.

00:33:16.356 --> 00:33:18.416 A:middle
But say your player is having
a little bit of a hard time.

00:33:18.416 --> 00:33:20.566 A:middle
They've been playing this
game for a little while.

00:33:20.566 --> 00:33:22.286 A:middle
Then they can't get
passed this level.

00:33:22.286 --> 00:33:23.556 A:middle
They're having a
really hard time.

00:33:24.136 --> 00:33:26.146 A:middle
Well, if you implement
your game as such,

00:33:26.276 --> 00:33:30.316 A:middle
then Player One can then share
their game with another player.

00:33:30.736 --> 00:33:32.446 A:middle
And so they can bring
in Player Two.

00:33:32.716 --> 00:33:34.286 A:middle
And then you can
either add some elements

00:33:34.286 --> 00:33:36.966 A:middle
that will allow Player
Two to help Player One

00:33:36.966 --> 00:33:39.266 A:middle
through that level,
through some co-op methods,

00:33:39.266 --> 00:33:41.626 A:middle
or you could even just allow
Player Two to just play

00:33:41.626 --> 00:33:44.696 A:middle
that level for Player One
so that they can get past

00:33:44.696 --> 00:33:47.606 A:middle
that really sticky point in
your game, allowing Player One

00:33:47.606 --> 00:33:48.906 A:middle
to have a little
bit more enjoyment.

00:33:49.116 --> 00:33:51.066 A:middle
So Player Two can come in, say,

00:33:51.636 --> 00:33:53.606 A:middle
do whatever you would
like to let them do.

00:33:53.606 --> 00:33:54.896 A:middle
Save that data, so
the game data.

00:33:54.896 --> 00:33:58.236 A:middle
And then they can lead
themselves, removing themselves

00:33:58.236 --> 00:34:00.656 A:middle
from that game and Player
One can continue on playing

00:33:58.236 --> 00:34:00.656 A:middle
from that game and Player
One can continue on playing

00:34:00.656 --> 00:34:04.036 A:middle
that game just as if Player
Two had never actually even

00:34:04.036 --> 00:34:05.086 A:middle
been there.

00:34:05.086 --> 00:34:08.556 A:middle
So that is Game Sessions.

00:34:09.056 --> 00:34:11.466 A:middle
This is going to allow you
to be able to basically play

00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:13.656 A:middle
with anyone, anyone that has
an iCloud account you can

00:34:13.656 --> 00:34:14.045 A:middle
play with.

00:34:14.096 --> 00:34:16.775 A:middle
You don't need to be their
friend in any sense of the word.

00:34:17.096 --> 00:34:21.176 A:middle
So much more flexible game
structure that is going

00:34:21.176 --> 00:34:24.446 A:middle
to allow you, as developers,
to be able to set up your games

00:34:24.446 --> 00:34:25.795 A:middle
in whatever manner
you would like.

00:34:25.795 --> 00:34:29.846 A:middle
We have really, really simple
multiplayer connections.

00:34:29.846 --> 00:34:32.416 A:middle
They are really easy to
set up, really stable.

00:34:32.416 --> 00:34:34.926 A:middle
They allow for lots of data
to be passed back and forth.

00:34:35.446 --> 00:34:36.966 A:middle
And we're really excited

00:34:36.966 --> 00:34:39.436 A:middle
to see what new possible game
styles you're going to come

00:34:39.436 --> 00:34:42.116 A:middle
up with because of
the power of Sessions.

00:34:42.116 --> 00:34:44.536 A:middle
Because of this mixing
of turn-based

00:34:44.806 --> 00:34:49.096 A:middle
and real-time elements for
these games we're really excited

00:34:49.136 --> 00:34:51.716 A:middle
to see what you're
going to come up with.

00:34:52.396 --> 00:34:55.446 A:middle
So that's what's new in
Game Center this year.

00:34:55.735 --> 00:34:58.396 A:middle
We had our new message-based
multiplayer invite

00:34:58.456 --> 00:34:59.816 A:middle
which are now going
to allow you to play

00:34:59.816 --> 00:35:01.306 A:middle
with anyone that
you can message.

00:34:59.816 --> 00:35:01.306 A:middle
with anyone that
you can message.

00:35:01.886 --> 00:35:04.616 A:middle
We have removed the
Game Center app.

00:35:04.806 --> 00:35:06.766 A:middle
We have those persistent
game sessions

00:35:07.216 --> 00:35:08.466 A:middle
that we just talked about.

00:35:08.756 --> 00:35:11.366 A:middle
And we have also announced
Apple Watch support.

00:35:11.716 --> 00:35:14.166 A:middle
If you would like any more
information on this session,

00:35:14.166 --> 00:35:15.186 A:middle
you can go to this link.

00:35:15.556 --> 00:35:17.706 A:middle
We are session number 611.

00:35:18.006 --> 00:35:20.316 A:middle
And we have a few
related sessions

00:35:20.316 --> 00:35:21.886 A:middle
that you might be interested in.

00:35:22.176 --> 00:35:23.316 A:middle
We have the "Game Technologies

00:35:23.316 --> 00:35:25.406 A:middle
for Apple Watch" later
on in this afternoon.

00:35:25.716 --> 00:35:29.296 A:middle
We've also had several
sessions earlier this week

00:35:29.296 --> 00:35:33.356 A:middle
that you can go and watch the
videos for, and several others,

00:35:33.356 --> 00:35:35.406 A:middle
even more than what's
listed here.

00:35:35.546 --> 00:35:38.796 A:middle
Thank you for coming
and have a great WWDC.

00:35:39.516 --> 00:35:43.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]
