00:00:26.136 --> 00:00:27.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. Good morning.

00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:29.346 A:middle
Good afternoon.

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:35.476 A:middle
My name is Ajit, and I used
to live and work not very far

00:00:35.476 --> 00:00:37.666 A:middle
from here on the East Bay.

00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:41.716 A:middle
I was an electrical engineer in
the heart of the Silicon Valley.

00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:46.606 A:middle
And in 2007, I did
something rather unusual.

00:00:46.606 --> 00:00:50.886 A:middle
I moved back to India from
California because I wanted

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:51.856 A:middle
to be an entrepreneur.

00:00:52.736 --> 00:00:57.326 A:middle
I'm an inventor at heart,
so I dabbled in a number

00:00:57.326 --> 00:00:59.836 A:middle
of different fields, a
number of different devices.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:00.806 --> 00:01:03.756 A:middle
But eventually, I
chose an area to work

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:05.406 A:middle
on that was rather
unconventional.

00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:09.356 A:middle
I decided I wanted to work
with kids with disabilities.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:12.576 A:middle
I wanted to make assistive
technology for children

00:01:12.576 --> 00:01:17.116 A:middle
who had difficulties with
various kinds of disabilities.

00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:22.876 A:middle
Now the way I got into
this particular field --

00:01:23.356 --> 00:01:26.546 A:middle
when I went back
to India in 2008,

00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:28.696 A:middle
there was a friend of mine.

00:01:28.696 --> 00:01:32.376 A:middle
And she runs a school in the
city of Chennai in the south

00:01:32.376 --> 00:01:35.266 A:middle
of India, and it's
called Vidya Sagar.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:39.006 A:middle
Now, Vidya Sagar is
a special school.

00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:42.486 A:middle
It's a school for kids with
various kinds of disabilities --

00:01:42.486 --> 00:01:44.776 A:middle
cerebral palsy, autism.

00:01:45.696 --> 00:01:49.266 A:middle
And when my friend found
out that I was looking

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:52.026 A:middle
for instant problems
to solve, she suggested

00:01:52.206 --> 00:01:55.796 A:middle
that I visit the school and
interact with the kids and see

00:01:55.796 --> 00:01:57.966 A:middle
if there was anything
that struck me.

00:01:59.496 --> 00:02:01.926 A:middle
So I went to Vidya
Sagar and I sat down


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.496 --> 00:02:01.926 A:middle
So I went to Vidya
Sagar and I sat down

00:02:01.926 --> 00:02:03.236 A:middle
and I met some of the kids.

00:02:04.506 --> 00:02:06.496 A:middle
Now that visit was
an eye-opener for me.

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:10.286 A:middle
You know, I saw that these
kids were intelligent,

00:02:10.545 --> 00:02:13.086 A:middle
they were smart, they
were eager to learn,

00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:15.046 A:middle
they were enthusiastic,
they were social.

00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:18.296 A:middle
But the reason that they weren't

00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:20.876 A:middle
in a regular school was
primarily one reason.

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:24.206 A:middle
And that was that they had
difficulty with communication.

00:02:25.856 --> 00:02:30.356 A:middle
Now, if you look at kids with
cerebral palsy, the main reason

00:02:30.356 --> 00:02:34.006 A:middle
that they can't communicate is
because the part of the brain

00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:36.786 A:middle
that process muscle
movements is impaired,

00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:38.516 A:middle
so they have difficulty
controlling all

00:02:38.516 --> 00:02:41.726 A:middle
of the different muscles that
are used to generate speech.

00:02:43.326 --> 00:02:45.696 A:middle
But with autism, it's actually
a very different story.

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:49.746 A:middle
The first kid that I met
with autism was actually

00:02:49.746 --> 00:02:51.616 A:middle
at Vidya Sagar during
that visit.

00:02:52.106 --> 00:02:53.026 A:middle
His name was Santhosh.

00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:57.006 A:middle
Now I was sitting across
the table from Santhosh,

00:02:57.006 --> 00:02:59.466 A:middle
and Santhosh had a lot of
difficulty with a few things

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:01.306 A:middle
that we take for granted.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:01.306 A:middle
that we take for granted.

00:03:01.526 --> 00:03:05.276 A:middle
For example, he found it really
hard to read my body language.

00:03:06.156 --> 00:03:09.256 A:middle
He would find it really hard
to see my face and to make

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:13.286 A:middle
out what kind of emotion I
was feeling at that time.

00:03:13.496 --> 00:03:15.116 A:middle
The other thing that
Santhosh had a lot

00:03:15.116 --> 00:03:16.756 A:middle
of difficulty with was language.

00:03:17.936 --> 00:03:20.766 A:middle
Because language is
fundamentally very symbolic.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.296 A:middle
You know, it's very abstract.

00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:24.626 A:middle
It's not something that
we realize every day,

00:03:24.626 --> 00:03:28.766 A:middle
but it's really one of the most
abstract things that we use.

00:03:29.346 --> 00:03:31.606 A:middle
We have all of these
different sound sequences,

00:03:31.606 --> 00:03:36.076 A:middle
all of these different words,
and these words are something

00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:38.976 A:middle
that we assign meaning
to almost arbitrarily.

00:03:40.396 --> 00:03:43.406 A:middle
For example, if I
said the word "dog",

00:03:44.426 --> 00:03:48.326 A:middle
the word "dog" doesn't
have anything to do

00:03:48.326 --> 00:03:51.306 A:middle
with the animal the way
that I pronounce the word,

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:52.446 A:middle
the way that I write the word.

00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:54.246 A:middle
You would never be
able to figure

00:03:54.246 --> 00:03:56.806 A:middle
out that it actually refers
to this particular animal.

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:01.316 A:middle
It's very much abstract sound
through which we've assigned,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:01.316 A:middle
It's very much abstract sound
through which we've assigned,

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.686 A:middle
you know, a convention
that we agree on.

00:04:04.416 --> 00:04:08.356 A:middle
And that's why someone
with autism has a lot

00:04:08.356 --> 00:04:09.356 A:middle
of difficulty with this.

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:14.246 A:middle
Our brains have the ability to,
you know, encode and decode tens

00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:17.116 A:middle
of thousands of these
arbitrary sound sequences.

00:04:17.676 --> 00:04:21.555 A:middle
But kids with autism find
it a little too fuzzy

00:04:21.896 --> 00:04:22.926 A:middle
for their comfort.

00:04:24.236 --> 00:04:27.456 A:middle
So my friend who runs
this school, Vidya Sagar,

00:04:27.456 --> 00:04:30.536 A:middle
she wanted me to look at
this particular problem

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:34.066 A:middle
and she wanted me to see if I
could come up with an invention

00:04:34.516 --> 00:04:36.816 A:middle
that could give a voice
to these children.

00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:39.736 A:middle
I thought that was a fascinating
problem to work on just

00:04:39.736 --> 00:04:40.996 A:middle
from a technology perspective.

00:04:41.546 --> 00:04:44.296 A:middle
I also thought it was a huge
opportunity in this case

00:04:44.296 --> 00:04:46.856 A:middle
because there were kids all
over India, and really all

00:04:46.856 --> 00:04:50.786 A:middle
over the world, who
needed something like this.

00:04:50.786 --> 00:04:53.916 A:middle
My starting point to
provide these kinds

00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:55.956 A:middle
of assistive technologies
was something

00:04:55.956 --> 00:04:59.336 A:middle
that had actually been
discovered in the 70s

00:04:59.336 --> 00:05:01.366 A:middle
and the 80s and was being
used quite effectively.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.336 --> 00:05:01.366 A:middle
and the 80s and was being
used quite effectively.

00:05:01.986 --> 00:05:05.346 A:middle
What people working with kids
with autism had discovered was

00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:09.536 A:middle
that many of them have extremely
strong visual intelligence.

00:05:09.696 --> 00:05:12.476 A:middle
So they have a lot of
difficulty with the abstractness

00:05:12.476 --> 00:05:14.196 A:middle
of language, but they
feel very comfortable

00:05:14.616 --> 00:05:16.446 A:middle
with the concreteness
of pictures.

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:18.946 A:middle
They're able to remember
pictures.

00:05:18.946 --> 00:05:21.756 A:middle
They're able to recall pictures
much easier than they're able

00:05:21.756 --> 00:05:24.836 A:middle
to do with sound
or with alphabets.

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.936 A:middle
Even in India, it wasn't
very uncommon to see kids

00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:30.726 A:middle
with books like these.

00:05:31.146 --> 00:05:34.726 A:middle
Picture books, picture charts,
picture bracelets sometimes

00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:36.036 A:middle
that they would wear
around their wrists.

00:05:36.556 --> 00:05:40.836 A:middle
And if they wanted to ask for a
specific object, if they wanted

00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:43.796 A:middle
to request for water for
example, they would point

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:48.716 A:middle
to a picture of water in their
book and that would communicate

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:50.056 A:middle
to other people that
they wanted water.

00:05:51.076 --> 00:05:56.806 A:middle
At that time in [inaudible]
America, in 2007 and 2008,

00:05:57.706 --> 00:06:01.816 A:middle
this concept was being used
quite effectively as part


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:57.706 --> 00:06:01.816 A:middle
this concept was being used
quite effectively as part

00:06:01.816 --> 00:06:04.366 A:middle
of these devices that
were being built.

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:07.536 A:middle
And this is an example
of one of these devices.

00:06:08.086 --> 00:06:11.276 A:middle
This is a fairly -- you know,
these devices were pretty big.

00:06:11.276 --> 00:06:12.226 A:middle
They were pretty bulky.

00:06:12.766 --> 00:06:15.756 A:middle
They ran a special
software on them.

00:06:15.756 --> 00:06:17.086 A:middle
They were often custom-built,

00:06:17.086 --> 00:06:18.776 A:middle
and they were paid
for by insurance.

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:20.876 A:middle
So they were pretty expensive.

00:06:20.926 --> 00:06:23.456 A:middle
This device, for example,
would have cost anywhere

00:06:23.646 --> 00:06:25.786 A:middle
between $5,000 to $10,000.

00:06:26.106 --> 00:06:29.046 A:middle
And that price point is
completely out of range

00:06:29.046 --> 00:06:32.236 A:middle
for even the most affluent
of parents in India.

00:06:32.906 --> 00:06:36.426 A:middle
But what was happening
with that in 2007,

00:06:36.426 --> 00:06:39.316 A:middle
for example, the
iPhone came out.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:42.136 A:middle
And that was the beginning
of the smartphone revolution.

00:06:42.406 --> 00:06:46.106 A:middle
Right? So it was possible
at that time, 2008,

00:06:46.756 --> 00:06:50.306 A:middle
to actually buy electronic
components off the shelf

00:06:50.306 --> 00:06:52.166 A:middle
which were being
used in smartphones,

00:06:52.536 --> 00:06:54.576 A:middle
in these touchscreen
devices all over the world.

00:06:55.086 --> 00:06:59.116 A:middle
And to assemble them together
to create a touchscreen tablet

00:06:59.476 --> 00:07:00.956 A:middle
for a fraction of the price just


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.476 --> 00:07:00.956 A:middle
for a fraction of the price just

00:07:00.956 --> 00:07:04.196 A:middle
for a few hundred
dollars instead of having

00:07:04.196 --> 00:07:06.336 A:middle
to create these things
from the ground-up.

00:07:06.856 --> 00:07:10.366 A:middle
So that became my strategy
going into this particular area.

00:07:11.066 --> 00:07:13.106 A:middle
I thought I would
create a special software

00:07:13.226 --> 00:07:16.266 A:middle
that they could use on top of
a device that we would build

00:07:16.266 --> 00:07:19.036 A:middle
from these smartphone
components,

00:07:19.496 --> 00:07:23.426 A:middle
and we would then use that
to give these children a way

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:24.096 A:middle
to communicate.

00:07:25.246 --> 00:07:31.516 A:middle
So I took this strategy and
then I plunged into the field

00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:33.196 A:middle
of creating assistive
technology.

00:07:33.666 --> 00:07:38.686 A:middle
And I quickly came up with
a very interesting talent.

00:07:39.766 --> 00:07:43.716 A:middle
You know, those of you who've
worked on solving hard problems

00:07:43.716 --> 00:07:47.676 A:middle
for a specific class of people,
you know that the process

00:07:47.846 --> 00:07:49.596 A:middle
of coming up with these
solutions is actually

00:07:49.596 --> 00:07:50.256 A:middle
pretty standard.

00:07:51.036 --> 00:07:54.336 A:middle
You go to the field, you talk to
people, and you listen to them,

00:07:54.336 --> 00:07:55.266 A:middle
you see what they have to say.

00:07:56.136 --> 00:07:58.096 A:middle
You ideate to come up
with these prototypes

00:07:58.096 --> 00:08:02.356 A:middle
and you build these
things that you take


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.096 --> 00:08:02.356 A:middle
and you build these
things that you take

00:08:03.306 --> 00:08:05.586 A:middle
to the people whose
problems you want to solve.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.736 A:middle
And then you get their feedback,
and then you iterate a number

00:08:08.736 --> 00:08:09.996 A:middle
of different times
till you have something

00:08:09.996 --> 00:08:10.856 A:middle
that works beautifully.

00:08:11.246 --> 00:08:12.886 A:middle
You know, that process
is very standardized.

00:08:13.206 --> 00:08:16.556 A:middle
In my particular case though,
I had a very peculiar problem.

00:08:16.946 --> 00:08:20.396 A:middle
Because the very reason that we
were building this device was

00:08:20.396 --> 00:08:22.366 A:middle
because these children
couldn't communicate.

00:08:23.706 --> 00:08:25.416 A:middle
So it was a chicken-and-egg
problem.

00:08:25.586 --> 00:08:27.766 A:middle
You know, we were
very happy to go

00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:29.546 A:middle
and ask them what they thought

00:08:29.546 --> 00:08:31.086 A:middle
about the prototypes
we were creating.

00:08:31.906 --> 00:08:33.456 A:middle
But what would actually
happen is

00:08:33.456 --> 00:08:36.326 A:middle
that the kids would use the
prototype for maybe a minute,

00:08:36.466 --> 00:08:38.635 A:middle
two minutes, and then
they would walk away.

00:08:39.405 --> 00:08:41.586 A:middle
And we had no idea -- you
know, were they tired?

Were they bored?

00:08:42.876 --> 00:08:44.006 A:middle
You know, did they not like it?

00:08:44.265 --> 00:08:46.956 A:middle
Did they think it was
completely worthless?

00:08:47.446 --> 00:08:48.676 A:middle
Were we solving the
wrong problem?

00:08:49.646 --> 00:08:53.096 A:middle
So that was a frustration
that, you know,

00:08:53.096 --> 00:08:55.696 A:middle
we lived with for
several months.

00:08:55.826 --> 00:08:58.966 A:middle

that's very close to your
hearts and that you really love.

00:09:07.056 --> 00:09:12.256 A:middle
You know, in my particular case,
you know, there was this boy.

00:09:12.656 --> 00:09:14.906 A:middle
His name was Rohit.

00:09:14.906 --> 00:09:17.566 A:middle
Rohit was one of the
people that we were trying

00:09:17.566 --> 00:09:19.256 A:middle
out every single one
of our prototypes with.

00:09:19.256 --> 00:09:22.026 A:middle
And one day, he came
into the room

00:09:22.026 --> 00:09:23.716 A:middle
where we were trying
out the prototype.

00:09:23.716 --> 00:09:25.926 A:middle
And I could see --
you know, on that day,

00:09:25.926 --> 00:09:28.196 A:middle
I could see the determination
in his face.

00:09:28.686 --> 00:09:30.436 A:middle
He was going to communicate
with me.

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:35.056 A:middle
He was completely -- he had
that look of grim determination

00:09:35.326 --> 00:09:37.336 A:middle
as he walked into the room.

00:09:37.336 --> 00:09:40.136 A:middle
And, you know, I gave
him the newest prototype.

00:09:40.136 --> 00:09:42.286 A:middle
And I sat there, waiting
with anticipation.

00:09:43.606 --> 00:09:45.976 A:middle
And Rohit actually took
the device that I built.

00:09:46.366 --> 00:09:48.906 A:middle
Very painstakingly,
over several minutes,

00:09:49.576 --> 00:09:51.296 A:middle
he tapped on various buttons.

00:09:52.366 --> 00:09:54.946 A:middle
And then the device
said, "This sucks."

It's not exactly the kind
of testimonial that is put

00:10:08.836 --> 00:10:11.396 A:middle
up on your website, but
it was music to my ears.

00:10:11.396 --> 00:10:11.976 A:middle
Believe me.

00:10:13.136 --> 00:10:15.786 A:middle
Because from that point onwards,
the going was much faster.

00:10:15.856 --> 00:10:18.446 A:middle
You know, we could convince him

00:10:18.446 --> 00:10:19.916 A:middle
to tell us exactly
what he liked,

00:10:19.916 --> 00:10:21.036 A:middle
exactly what he didn't like.

00:10:22.036 --> 00:10:26.396 A:middle
And within a few months,
we'd come up with a device

00:10:26.396 --> 00:10:29.036 A:middle
that met Rohit's expectations.

00:10:30.286 --> 00:10:32.806 A:middle
And that was the device that
we launched to the market.

00:10:33.076 --> 00:10:34.076 A:middle
We called it Avaz.

00:10:34.416 --> 00:10:36.536 A:middle
Avaz is the Hindi
word for "voice".

00:10:36.536 --> 00:10:39.606 A:middle
It also means similar things
in many other languages.

00:10:40.046 --> 00:10:41.976 A:middle
Let me show you the device
that we actually built.

00:10:52.636 --> 00:10:58.556 A:middle
So this was the first prototype
that was ready for release,

00:10:58.556 --> 00:11:01.926 A:middle
the first product that
we built off Avaz.

00:10:58.556 --> 00:11:01.926 A:middle
the first product that
we built off Avaz.

00:11:02.356 --> 00:11:05.756 A:middle
It's the big, bulky,
black metal box,

00:11:05.756 --> 00:11:08.856 A:middle
and it's stuffed
with electronics.

00:11:09.176 --> 00:11:11.676 A:middle
You know, you could
mount it on a wheelchair.

00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:13.386 A:middle
You could put it on a desk.

00:11:14.196 --> 00:11:17.386 A:middle
Along with its wheelchair mount,
it weighed about 8 pounds,

00:11:17.706 --> 00:11:18.606 A:middle
so it was pretty heavy.

00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:21.566 A:middle
It had about an hour
of battery life.

00:11:21.566 --> 00:11:26.086 A:middle
You know, there was a really
embarrassing thing that happened

00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:28.066 A:middle
on the day that we were
supposed to launch this.

00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:30.906 A:middle
We kept it on a desk, and a
kid accidentally pushed it

00:11:30.906 --> 00:11:31.956 A:middle
down with his hand.

00:11:32.486 --> 00:11:34.656 A:middle
And it fell down on the
floor and it broke one

00:11:34.656 --> 00:11:35.676 A:middle
of the tiles on the floor.

00:11:36.516 --> 00:11:42.566 A:middle
[ Laugther ]

00:11:43.066 --> 00:11:44.126 A:middle
That was how heavy it was.

00:11:45.396 --> 00:11:48.646 A:middle
You know, as a concession to
safety, among other things,

00:11:49.426 --> 00:11:52.706 A:middle
we replaced the case
with plastic.

00:11:53.326 --> 00:12:02.586 A:middle
So that's the final version
of Avaz that we put out.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:53.326 --> 00:12:02.586 A:middle
So that's the final version
of Avaz that we put out.

00:12:02.626 --> 00:12:09.056 A:middle
This device costs about $600
-- 30,000 Indian rupees.

00:12:09.556 --> 00:12:12.456 A:middle
And at that price, it was
about 1/10 of the price

00:12:12.456 --> 00:12:14.676 A:middle
of similar dedicated
devices that were

00:12:14.676 --> 00:12:17.306 A:middle
in the market at that time.

00:12:17.306 --> 00:12:18.946 A:middle
And it was a breakthrough
in India.

00:12:18.946 --> 00:12:22.076 A:middle
It was the very first time that
anyone had created a device

00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:24.526 A:middle
for speech-assistive
technology in India.

00:12:25.206 --> 00:12:28.206 A:middle
And almost immediately
after we had it out there,

00:12:28.696 --> 00:12:31.236 A:middle
we started getting orders
from all over the country.

00:12:31.406 --> 00:12:34.266 A:middle
You know, every special
school in India wrote to us

00:12:34.266 --> 00:12:37.036 A:middle
and they wanted to know how they
could get their hands on Avaz

00:12:37.036 --> 00:12:38.076 A:middle
and how they could use it.

00:12:39.196 --> 00:12:41.736 A:middle
But Avaz was still a
very niche product.

00:12:41.736 --> 00:12:44.266 A:middle
I mean, it's meant for the
very specific niche of people

00:12:44.266 --> 00:12:46.746 A:middle
that have these particular
disabilities.

00:12:47.286 --> 00:12:52.606 A:middle
So we had this -- you know,
making dedicated hardware

00:12:52.656 --> 00:12:55.806 A:middle
in these small volumes
is always a challenge.

00:12:56.346 --> 00:12:58.216 A:middle
So even though the
response was fantastic,

00:12:58.216 --> 00:12:59.586 A:middle
even though we got
a lot of interest,

00:12:59.586 --> 00:13:01.406 A:middle
and even though this was
really helping the kids

and even though this was
really helping the kids

00:13:01.466 --> 00:13:05.686 A:middle
that we were intending
this to help, you know,

00:13:05.686 --> 00:13:07.116 A:middle
the more devices
we were selling,

00:13:07.246 --> 00:13:09.526 A:middle
the more money we were losing
just because we were spending

00:13:09.526 --> 00:13:12.036 A:middle
so much money in creating these
devices in the first place.

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.706 A:middle
You know, we were
struggling to figure

00:13:15.706 --> 00:13:18.106 A:middle
out how we could make
the business sustainable.

00:13:18.106 --> 00:13:24.066 A:middle
And then in 2010, the
big news happened.

00:13:24.806 --> 00:13:27.416 A:middle
Steve Jobs announced the iPad.

00:13:28.056 --> 00:13:30.606 A:middle
And that was the start
of the tablet revolution.

00:13:30.606 --> 00:13:34.266 A:middle
But it also was a revolution
in the fortunes of my startup

00:13:35.186 --> 00:13:37.976 A:middle
because we saw this as a
way of getting ourselves

00:13:37.976 --> 00:13:41.136 A:middle
out of this hardware corner
that we painted ourselves into

00:13:41.776 --> 00:13:45.946 A:middle
and being able to make
these devices reach people,

00:13:46.096 --> 00:13:48.376 A:middle
making this application
reach people without having

00:13:48.376 --> 00:13:49.756 A:middle
to make the devices to do that.

00:13:50.846 --> 00:13:52.776 A:middle
So, in 2010, my team

00:13:52.776 --> 00:13:55.586 A:middle
and I started learning
how to code for iOS.

00:13:55.966 --> 00:14:02.926 A:middle
And in 2011, we launched the
first version of the Avaz App.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:55.966 --> 00:14:02.926 A:middle
And in 2011, we launched the
first version of the Avaz App.

00:14:03.206 --> 00:14:06.266 A:middle
Now the core functionality

00:14:06.266 --> 00:14:10.706 A:middle
of Avaz actually remains
the same today, you know,

00:14:10.706 --> 00:14:12.746 A:middle
compared to the first version

00:14:12.746 --> 00:14:14.916 A:middle
that we launched
way back in 2011.

00:14:14.916 --> 00:14:17.976 A:middle
And let me show you a
quick demo of how it works.

00:14:28.046 --> 00:14:28.786 A:middle
So this is Avaz.

00:14:29.076 --> 00:14:32.096 A:middle
And you can see that
it's essentially a bunch

00:14:32.096 --> 00:14:33.086 A:middle
of different pictures.

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:36.896 A:middle
So there's pictures in here,
and there are pictures in each

00:14:36.896 --> 00:14:38.166 A:middle
of these different categories.

00:14:39.136 --> 00:14:41.846 A:middle
So there are literally thousands
of pictures in the app.

00:14:42.126 --> 00:14:45.836 A:middle
And a parent, or a teacher,
or a therapist could go in

00:14:45.836 --> 00:14:48.486 A:middle
and add words from the
child's life with photographs

00:14:48.686 --> 00:14:50.166 A:middle
from the child's life as well.

00:14:50.876 --> 00:14:52.896 A:middle
And the way that Avaz
works for a child

00:14:52.896 --> 00:14:54.316 A:middle
with a disability
is very simple.

00:14:54.316 --> 00:14:59.386 A:middle
A child would be able to recall
and remember these pictures.

00:14:59.906 --> 00:15:01.706 A:middle
And every time they
tap the picture.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.906 --> 00:15:01.706 A:middle
And every time they
tap the picture.

00:15:02.446 --> 00:15:02.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I

00:15:03.396 --> 00:15:04.456 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It will speak that out.

00:15:04.526 --> 00:15:07.006 A:middle
And they would be able to
sequence pictures together.

00:15:07.216 --> 00:15:07.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Feel

00:15:08.206 --> 00:15:11.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; This way, and they could go
into these different categories.

00:15:11.216 --> 00:15:13.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Describe feelings.

00:15:14.106 --> 00:15:16.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And they could pick
different pictures out.

00:15:16.076 --> 00:15:17.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Excited

00:15:17.586 --> 00:15:19.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; To be able to
create sentences.

00:15:19.996 --> 00:15:21.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I feel excited.

00:15:21.426 --> 00:15:23.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And then the app
would speak that out.

00:15:25.366 --> 00:15:28.906 A:middle
So that's Avaz -- essentially,
a bunch of different pictures

00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:32.536 A:middle
with a picture vocabulary that
helps children communicate.

00:15:32.956 --> 00:15:38.086 A:middle
So Avaz was literally
an artificial voice

00:15:38.576 --> 00:15:39.896 A:middle
for kids with disabilities.

00:15:42.096 --> 00:15:48.306 A:middle
You know, when we put Avaz
out in the field in India,

00:15:49.576 --> 00:15:51.536 A:middle
it was immediately
a game-changer

00:15:51.696 --> 00:15:52.536 A:middle
in many different ways.

00:15:53.256 --> 00:15:56.176 A:middle
For this kid, Rohit,
who had worked with us

00:15:56.176 --> 00:16:00.216 A:middle
to build Avaz, he
grew to love Avaz.

to build Avaz, he
grew to love Avaz.

00:16:00.476 --> 00:16:03.846 A:middle
You know, he grew to be
able to customize and use it

00:16:03.846 --> 00:16:07.536 A:middle
so effectively that that same
year that we launched the app,

00:16:08.006 --> 00:16:12.396 A:middle
he went on to use Avaz to write
his exams and to finish school

00:16:12.616 --> 00:16:15.386 A:middle
and to go on to college.

00:16:15.536 --> 00:16:18.416 A:middle
You know, the media all over
India picked up the story

00:16:18.836 --> 00:16:20.556 A:middle
of this kid who'd
finished his exams

00:16:20.556 --> 00:16:21.986 A:middle
with an assistive-technology
device.

00:16:22.436 --> 00:16:23.666 A:middle
And not just this kid.

00:16:23.756 --> 00:16:25.636 A:middle
You know, they started
picking up stories from all

00:16:25.636 --> 00:16:29.576 A:middle
over the country about who kids
who had used Avaz to do things.

00:16:30.136 --> 00:16:33.996 A:middle
And even to this day, I think
Avaz has shaped the narrative

00:16:34.496 --> 00:16:36.776 A:middle
around these disabilities
in Indian media.

00:16:37.186 --> 00:16:38.926 A:middle
People started concentrating
less

00:16:38.926 --> 00:16:42.306 A:middle
on what these children could
not do and more on the abilities

00:16:42.306 --> 00:16:43.866 A:middle
of these children and
what they could do.

00:16:44.366 --> 00:16:48.676 A:middle
So that's one of the things that
Avaz has accomplished in India.

00:16:48.676 --> 00:16:49.856 A:middle

about Avaz users is actually
something that happened back

in the school where
this all started,

00:17:04.836 --> 00:17:07.606 A:middle
in the school of Vidya Sagar.

00:17:07.606 --> 00:17:09.935 A:middle
You know, the children at Vidya
Sagar, every year they put

up this play for the parents

00:17:13.546 --> 00:17:14.876 A:middle
and for the well-wishers
of the school.

00:17:15.705 --> 00:17:17.685 A:middle
And it just so happens
that, you know, every year,

00:17:17.685 --> 00:17:22.566 A:middle
it was almost a convention that
the lead roles in this play,

00:17:22.796 --> 00:17:25.705 A:middle
the most important roles,
would go to the kids

00:17:25.705 --> 00:17:27.616 A:middle
who could speak -- I
mean, the verbal children.

00:17:28.146 --> 00:17:28.766 A:middle
And the presence

00:17:28.766 --> 00:17:32.346 A:middle
of the nonverbal children was
very subdued in this event.

00:17:33.686 --> 00:17:35.746 A:middle
The year we put out Avaz,

00:17:35.986 --> 00:17:38.536 A:middle
the principal made this
incredibly bold decision.

00:17:39.426 --> 00:17:43.816 A:middle
He said, "This year, all of the
parts are going to go to kids

00:17:43.816 --> 00:17:46.096 A:middle
who can't speak,
and they're going

00:17:46.096 --> 00:17:48.386 A:middle
to deliver their
dialogues with Avaz."

00:17:49.196 --> 00:17:53.886 A:middle
You know, I was sitting in
the front row on the day

00:17:53.886 --> 00:17:55.066 A:middle
that that play was going on.

00:17:55.386 --> 00:17:58.386 A:middle
You know, I was extensively
a special guest.

00:17:58.426 --> 00:18:00.776 A:middle
But really, the principal
expected me to jump

expected me to jump

00:18:00.776 --> 00:18:03.486 A:middle
up on the stage and fix things
if something didn't work.

[ Laughter ]

00:18:06.066 --> 00:18:07.986 A:middle
But I was sitting in the
front row right there.

00:18:09.186 --> 00:18:10.956 A:middle
And the atmosphere
was incredible.

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:11.916 A:middle
It was electric.

00:18:12.556 --> 00:18:15.516 A:middle
You know, I could see how much
fun these kids were having

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:19.386 A:middle
delivering their dialogues and
doing all of their, you know,

00:18:19.386 --> 00:18:20.916 A:middle
all of their actions
and everything.

00:18:21.156 --> 00:18:24.156 A:middle
And I turn back and I looked at
the parents of these children,

00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:26.396 A:middle
and they had tears
in their eyes.

00:18:26.396 --> 00:18:29.416 A:middle
You know, this was
the very first time

00:18:29.506 --> 00:18:31.876 A:middle
that these kids were
able to participate

00:18:31.876 --> 00:18:34.416 A:middle
in this quintessential
school experience

00:18:34.706 --> 00:18:36.916 A:middle
of being a part of
a school play.

00:18:37.296 --> 00:18:40.506 A:middle
And at that moment, I think it
sank into many of those parents

00:18:40.926 --> 00:18:43.366 A:middle
about how transformational
this device would be

00:18:43.526 --> 00:18:46.506 A:middle
in the lives of these kids.

00:18:55.056 --> 00:18:56.836 A:middle
Another really important
moment in the history

00:18:56.926 --> 00:18:59.936 A:middle
of Avaz happened a little
later, a few months later.

We got a call -- you know,
our customer support person --

00:19:04.266 --> 00:19:06.706 A:middle
she got a call from a
parent in central India.

00:19:06.806 --> 00:19:09.766 A:middle
You know, so this
parent called her up.

00:19:09.766 --> 00:19:13.086 A:middle
And this call was actually --
it played out very differently

00:19:13.086 --> 00:19:14.476 A:middle
from most of the
calls that we get,

00:19:14.626 --> 00:19:15.726 A:middle
you know, for customer support.

00:19:16.266 --> 00:19:20.106 A:middle
This lady had bought
Avaz for her son.

00:19:20.106 --> 00:19:21.326 A:middle
And, you know, she wanted

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:22.666 A:middle
to know a bunch of
different things.

00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:26.586 A:middle
You know, she wanted to know
how she could assess her son

00:19:26.696 --> 00:19:28.956 A:middle
for whether this device
was suitable for the son,

00:19:28.956 --> 00:19:31.566 A:middle
and she wanted to know how
to set it up for her son.

00:19:32.476 --> 00:19:34.946 A:middle
She wanted to know how to
integrate it into his lessons.

00:19:34.946 --> 00:19:37.276 A:middle
She wanted to know how to
set up curriculum around it.

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:39.326 A:middle
She wanted to know how
she could track progress,

00:19:39.826 --> 00:19:40.876 A:middle
you know, over the months.

00:19:41.416 --> 00:19:43.036 A:middle
She essentially wanted
to know how

00:19:43.036 --> 00:19:45.246 A:middle
to implement the
app for her son.

00:19:45.996 --> 00:19:51.836 A:middle
Now this is actually a pretty
atypical question that we get.

00:19:51.836 --> 00:19:55.476 A:middle
Because in most installations
of Avaz that we've seen,

00:19:56.106 --> 00:19:59.066 A:middle
a speech therapist would be
the person that would work

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:02.656 A:middle
with the kid in order to
implement the app for them.

with the kid in order to
implement the app for them.

00:20:02.886 --> 00:20:04.076 A:middle
So the speech therapist
would meet

00:20:04.076 --> 00:20:06.266 A:middle
with the kid maybe once a week,
they would do assessments,

00:20:06.266 --> 00:20:07.496 A:middle
they would do all of
these different things.

00:20:08.256 --> 00:20:09.746 A:middle
And so we asked this lady,

00:20:09.746 --> 00:20:11.886 A:middle
"Why don't you ask your speech
therapist these questions?

00:20:11.886 --> 00:20:15.396 A:middle
You know, that person is
probably much more qualified

00:20:15.496 --> 00:20:17.026 A:middle
to give you an answer to
some of these things."

00:20:18.086 --> 00:20:18.786 A:middle
On that day, I found

00:20:18.786 --> 00:20:22.916 A:middle
out something very
interesting about India.

00:20:23.256 --> 00:20:25.746 A:middle
This lady's son didn't
have a speech therapist.

00:20:26.936 --> 00:20:28.986 A:middle
In fact, the closest
speech therapist

00:20:29.286 --> 00:20:32.006 A:middle
to that lady was 300 miles away.

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.346 A:middle
If she had to find a speech
therapist for her son,

00:20:35.346 --> 00:20:37.806 A:middle
she'd have to get on a
train, travel for six hours,

00:20:38.256 --> 00:20:41.726 A:middle
and go to a speech
therapist and come back home.

00:20:41.936 --> 00:20:43.026 A:middle
In fact, I'll tell you this.

00:20:43.406 --> 00:20:44.916 A:middle
In the entire country of India,

00:20:45.056 --> 00:20:47.136 A:middle
the country of 1.3
billion people,

00:20:48.256 --> 00:20:50.506 A:middle
there are 1,800 speech
therapists.

00:20:51.636 --> 00:20:53.846 A:middle
You could take all of the
speech therapists in India

00:20:53.846 --> 00:20:55.726 A:middle
and you could put
them in this room,

00:20:55.726 --> 00:20:58.466 A:middle
and you could fill this room
three times over with the number

00:20:58.466 --> 00:20:59.816 A:middle
of speech therapists
that are in India.

00:21:01.736 --> 00:21:04.956 A:middle
So this was a mind-blowing
moment for us.

00:21:04.956 --> 00:21:07.056 A:middle
This was really an
eye-opening moment for us.

00:21:07.056 --> 00:21:10.856 A:middle
And what we had to do eventually
was that we had to take the app,

00:21:10.926 --> 00:21:14.486 A:middle
Avaz, and we had to build this
complete new app inside it.

00:21:14.486 --> 00:21:17.036 A:middle
So it's almost like a
sub-app within Avaz.

00:21:17.636 --> 00:21:18.916 A:middle
And what that sub-app did --

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:21.676 A:middle
it was a pretty new
idea at that time.

00:21:21.676 --> 00:21:25.156 A:middle
What that sub-app did was
that it trained a parent

00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:27.926 A:middle
to be a therapist
for their child.

00:21:28.336 --> 00:21:30.546 A:middle
That was the only way that we
could get over this problem.

00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:32.076 A:middle
You know, as a startup,

00:21:32.076 --> 00:21:36.026 A:middle
we couldn't train the 5 million
therapists that India needs.

00:21:36.626 --> 00:21:39.486 A:middle
But this was actually more
transformational in my opinion

00:21:39.486 --> 00:21:42.726 A:middle
than even Avaz itself because
we were not just giving a device

00:21:42.726 --> 00:21:46.256 A:middle
for the child, we were actually
building up the resource base

00:21:46.866 --> 00:21:50.206 A:middle
for these children to get
high-quality intervention,

00:21:50.646 --> 00:21:56.666 A:middle
and from the people that these
children mattered the most

00:21:56.886 --> 00:21:58.676 A:middle
to -- to their parents.

after we brought Avaz out.

00:22:02.866 --> 00:22:05.856 A:middle

that, I won an award

00:22:05.856 --> 00:22:06.906 A:middle

than this --

you know, after five
years of lobbying --

00:22:17.196 --> 00:22:22.496 A:middle
this year, at long last, one of
the big states in India decided

00:22:22.496 --> 00:22:26.846 A:middle
to buy iPads, install Avaz on
them, and to give them away

00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:29.236 A:middle
to every school that they
supported in the state.

that the Indian government has
invested in assistive technology

for kids with speech
disabilities,

Today, there are
about 30,000 kids

00:23:11.766 --> 00:23:14.896 A:middle
around the world whose lives
have been touched by Avaz.

00:23:14.896 --> 00:23:16.326 A:middle
Avaz is an artificial voice

for 30,000 children

You know, at these
scales -- 30,000 users --

00:23:23.196 --> 00:23:25.566 A:middle
we could see some very
interesting patterns

00:23:25.566 --> 00:23:27.016 A:middle
in the way that Avaz was used.

00:23:27.596 --> 00:23:29.006 A:middle
And let me talk to
you a little bit

00:23:29.006 --> 00:23:32.356 A:middle
about how Avaz was being
used around the world.

00:23:34.756 --> 00:23:37.096 A:middle
What Avaz did very
successfully was

00:23:37.096 --> 00:23:40.346 A:middle
to help kids have this
alternate access to words.

00:23:40.346 --> 00:23:43.116 A:middle
So instead of having to speak
them out, instead of having

00:23:43.116 --> 00:23:45.436 A:middle
to remember how they sounded,

00:23:45.436 --> 00:23:47.186 A:middle
they could use pictures
to communicate.

00:23:47.186 --> 00:23:50.966 A:middle
So, for example, if a kid wanted
to say that they were hungry

00:23:50.966 --> 00:23:53.766 A:middle
and they wanted something to
eat, they could go into the app

00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:55.226 A:middle
and find the word
"eat" and tap on it.

00:23:56.216 --> 00:23:58.396 A:middle
If they wanted to say that they
wanted to go to the bathroom,

00:23:58.396 --> 00:24:00.236 A:middle
for example, they
could go into the app


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:58.396 --> 00:24:00.236 A:middle
for example, they
could go into the app

00:24:00.316 --> 00:24:01.326 A:middle
and find the word "toilet".

00:24:01.846 --> 00:24:03.536 A:middle
If they were eating something

00:24:03.536 --> 00:24:06.786 A:middle
and they found the food
incredibly gross, they could go

00:24:06.786 --> 00:24:08.686 A:middle
into the app and they
could find the word "yucky"

00:24:08.686 --> 00:24:12.556 A:middle
and they could say that.

00:24:12.556 --> 00:24:16.086 A:middle
The problem happened when
kids had to communicate

00:24:16.236 --> 00:24:18.176 A:middle
with more than one word.

00:24:19.296 --> 00:24:23.366 A:middle
So, for example, if a kid
had to say, "I want water,"

00:24:24.066 --> 00:24:26.676 A:middle
it was quite common that
they would pick the word

00:24:26.676 --> 00:24:28.796 A:middle
"water" first and then they
would pick the word "want".

00:24:30.196 --> 00:24:32.436 A:middle
And they would do
it right sometimes.

00:24:32.436 --> 00:24:33.516 A:middle
They would do it
wrong sometimes.

00:24:33.516 --> 00:24:35.096 A:middle
But they were doing
it wrong as many times

00:24:35.096 --> 00:24:35.866 A:middle
as they were doing it right.

00:24:36.366 --> 00:24:38.666 A:middle
Or, for example, if they wanted
to say, "The boy is swimming,"

00:24:39.126 --> 00:24:40.446 A:middle
they would just pick
the word for "swim"

00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:41.526 A:middle
and they would pick
the word for "boy".

00:24:41.846 --> 00:24:44.776 A:middle
You know, they weren't really
creating these sentences.

00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:50.296 A:middle
You see, Avaz was very
successful at breaking

00:24:50.296 --> 00:24:55.726 A:middle
down this symbolism of words
and putting the concreteness

00:24:55.726 --> 00:24:56.836 A:middle
of pictures into that.

00:24:57.646 --> 00:25:00.586 A:middle
But this is actually a different
level of symbolism at play here.

00:24:57.646 --> 00:25:00.586 A:middle
But this is actually a different
level of symbolism at play here.

00:25:00.586 --> 00:25:02.336 A:middle
This is a symbolism of grammar.

00:25:03.146 --> 00:25:06.616 A:middle
And grammar is something
that's so abstract,

00:25:06.616 --> 00:25:07.856 A:middle
and there are the
rules of grammar.

00:25:07.906 --> 00:25:09.876 A:middle
And those rules of
grammar are so abstract

00:25:09.876 --> 00:25:13.296 A:middle
that they're even very hard
for us as native speakers

00:25:13.296 --> 00:25:14.976 A:middle
to explain and to understand.

00:25:15.886 --> 00:25:18.026 A:middle
You know? For example, if
you take this sentence,

00:25:18.026 --> 00:25:20.996 A:middle
"I want to eat,"
what's the meaning

00:25:20.996 --> 00:25:22.816 A:middle
of the word "to"
in the sentence?

00:25:22.906 --> 00:25:25.686 A:middle
You know, if you asked me,
I wouldn't have an idea.

00:25:25.726 --> 00:25:27.386 A:middle
It's just a word that's there

00:25:27.386 --> 00:25:30.496 A:middle
because it's ungrammatical
if it wasn't there.

00:25:31.516 --> 00:25:33.726 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:25:34.226 --> 00:25:37.126 A:middle
If you take these sentences,
"The window broke," and,

00:25:37.126 --> 00:25:39.396 A:middle
"He broke the window,"
it's interesting, you know,

00:25:39.396 --> 00:25:41.396 A:middle
these two sentences are
both grammatically correct.

00:25:41.636 --> 00:25:43.926 A:middle
But the object that's
breaking is actually the same.

00:25:43.926 --> 00:25:45.746 A:middle
Right? The window is the
object that's breaking.

00:25:45.746 --> 00:25:49.466 A:middle
Why is it that it appears on one
side of "broke" on one sentence

00:25:49.466 --> 00:25:51.356 A:middle
and on the other side of
"broke" in the other sentence?

00:25:51.966 --> 00:25:56.146 A:middle
Or if you take this sentence,
"I eat," the past tense

00:25:56.146 --> 00:25:59.026 A:middle
of this is obviously, "I ate."

00:25:59.156 --> 00:26:01.706 A:middle
But if you negate this sentence,
if you say, "I didn't eat,"


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.156 --> 00:26:01.706 A:middle
But if you negate this sentence,
if you say, "I didn't eat,"

00:26:03.306 --> 00:26:05.796 A:middle
why is it wrong to
say, "I didn't ate"?

00:26:06.826 --> 00:26:11.926 A:middle
Right? So there are these
meta-rules at play here.

00:26:12.006 --> 00:26:15.586 A:middle
There are these things
that go beyond the rules

00:26:15.586 --> 00:26:18.306 A:middle
of which word presents
which meaning.

00:26:18.926 --> 00:26:20.466 A:middle
There are these meta-rules
of grammar.

00:26:21.056 --> 00:26:23.116 A:middle
And this was actually
very frustrating to us.

00:26:23.206 --> 00:26:28.026 A:middle
We went out behind the
pursuit Avaz with the intention

00:26:28.026 --> 00:26:30.356 A:middle
of giving communication,
full communication,

00:26:30.396 --> 00:26:32.396 A:middle
equal communication to
kids with disabilities.

00:26:32.726 --> 00:26:36.056 A:middle
And we knew that our mission
was actually being completely

00:26:36.056 --> 00:26:39.416 A:middle
underfulfilled if we were
only giving them words

00:26:39.646 --> 00:26:42.946 A:middle
without giving them the
ability to also create sentences

00:26:42.946 --> 00:26:44.046 A:middle
and to put these words together.

00:26:44.046 --> 00:26:47.446 A:middle
The problem was that,
unlike in the case of Avaz,

00:26:48.386 --> 00:26:50.166 A:middle
there was actually
very little research,

00:26:50.466 --> 00:26:53.946 A:middle
very little theory behind
how you can teach children

00:26:53.946 --> 00:26:55.636 A:middle
with autism grammar,
how you can teach them

00:26:55.636 --> 00:26:56.486 A:middle
to put words together.

00:26:57.076 --> 00:26:59.926 A:middle
We trawled through all of
the scientific journals.

00:26:59.926 --> 00:27:01.506 A:middle
We went to all of the
scientific conferences.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.926 --> 00:27:01.506 A:middle
We went to all of the
scientific conferences.

00:27:01.536 --> 00:27:03.416 A:middle
But very little insights
that people had got.

00:27:05.556 --> 00:27:09.816 A:middle
The insight that kind of
triggered a lot of ideas

00:27:09.816 --> 00:27:14.286 A:middle
in our head quite consistently
came from the work of somebody

00:27:14.286 --> 00:27:17.336 A:middle
who lived 2,500 years ago.

00:27:17.766 --> 00:27:19.756 A:middle
He was an Indian philosopher.

00:27:21.156 --> 00:27:23.976 A:middle
I don't know if he
exactly looks like this.

00:27:24.071 --> 00:27:26.071 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:27:26.126 --> 00:27:28.846 A:middle
The Indian government put out
a stamp about him in 2004.

00:27:29.026 --> 00:27:32.206 A:middle
He has the unfortunate
distinction of sharing his name

00:27:32.206 --> 00:27:33.106 A:middle
with a kind of sandwich.

00:27:33.106 --> 00:27:33.946 A:middle
It's called Panini.

00:27:34.031 --> 00:27:36.031 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:27:36.046 --> 00:27:41.906 A:middle
But Panini lived in -- it didn't
mean "sandwich" back then.

00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:44.031 A:middle
[ Laugther ]

00:27:44.046 --> 00:27:46.986 A:middle
Panini lived around 500 BC.

00:27:47.216 --> 00:27:49.446 A:middle
And Panini did something
which was phenomenal,

00:27:49.516 --> 00:27:51.886 A:middle
which is unprecedented
even today.

00:27:52.416 --> 00:27:55.736 A:middle
He took a language, the
language of Sanskrit,

00:27:57.206 --> 00:28:03.396 A:middle
and he created a concise,
complete, consistent set


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.206 --> 00:28:03.396 A:middle
and he created a concise,
complete, consistent set

00:28:03.396 --> 00:28:08.756 A:middle
of rules -- 4,000 rules -- that
described the entire language.

00:28:10.626 --> 00:28:14.736 A:middle
OK, so he had this set of 4,000
rules, and those rules are

00:28:14.796 --> 00:28:16.286 A:middle
of course still relevant today.

00:28:16.616 --> 00:28:20.586 A:middle
But with these 4,000 rules, if
you apply these 4,000 rules,

00:28:21.006 --> 00:28:23.496 A:middle
any sentence that you
created would be guaranteed

00:28:23.496 --> 00:28:25.066 A:middle
to be grammatically-correct
Sanskrit.

00:28:26.346 --> 00:28:28.686 A:middle
And conversely, any
grammatically-correct sentence

00:28:28.686 --> 00:28:32.326 A:middle
in Sanskrit, any sentence, any
book, any verbal reference,

00:28:32.326 --> 00:28:36.396 A:middle
any grammatically-correct
Sanskrit could be explained

00:28:36.766 --> 00:28:38.156 A:middle
with these 4,000 rules.

00:28:38.646 --> 00:28:40.916 A:middle
It was almost like he had
written a computer program

00:28:41.736 --> 00:28:42.986 A:middle
to generate Sanskrit.

00:28:43.496 --> 00:28:48.626 A:middle
So that codification of a
language and the way that he did

00:28:48.626 --> 00:28:50.156 A:middle
that was absolutely beautiful.

00:28:50.156 --> 00:28:51.306 A:middle
It was phenomenal.

00:28:51.566 --> 00:28:54.486 A:middle
But that codification of
Sanskrit gave us the first clue

00:28:54.916 --> 00:28:56.566 A:middle
that maybe this is an
approach that we can take.

00:28:56.566 --> 00:28:58.846 A:middle
Maybe we can codify the
rules of grammar and put it

00:28:58.846 --> 00:29:01.306 A:middle
into a computer in some
sense and see if we can use


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.846 --> 00:29:01.306 A:middle
into a computer in some
sense and see if we can use

00:29:01.306 --> 00:29:04.816 A:middle
that to give kids with
autism an access to grammar.

00:29:05.886 --> 00:29:08.186 A:middle
But even though we
had that insight,

00:29:09.136 --> 00:29:11.796 A:middle
the other missing component
was really the user experience.

00:29:11.796 --> 00:29:14.016 A:middle
How could we get kids to
interact with grammar?

00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:18.996 A:middle
And the answer to that really
appropriately came when I was

00:29:19.066 --> 00:29:22.716 A:middle
in a school for kids with autism
and I happened to interact

00:29:22.796 --> 00:29:26.376 A:middle
with -- I happened to
be present, you know,

00:29:26.376 --> 00:29:29.136 A:middle
where there was this little
girl, and there was her mother,

00:29:29.136 --> 00:29:30.236 A:middle
and there were her teachers.

00:29:30.926 --> 00:29:33.066 A:middle
And this girl, you
know, she had autism

00:29:33.066 --> 00:29:34.716 A:middle
and she was almost
completely nonverbal.

00:29:34.716 --> 00:29:35.986 A:middle
But once in a while,
she could speak.

00:29:36.556 --> 00:29:37.836 A:middle
And that's what happened
that day.

00:29:37.836 --> 00:29:41.246 A:middle
She jumped up and she
said the word "eat".

00:29:41.956 --> 00:29:43.426 A:middle
And there was no
context to this.

00:29:43.806 --> 00:29:45.296 A:middle
She just finished
eating her lunch,

00:29:45.426 --> 00:29:47.186 A:middle
so her teacher thought
perhaps she wanted

00:29:47.186 --> 00:29:48.276 A:middle
to talk about her lunch.

00:29:48.756 --> 00:29:51.296 A:middle
So they tried to get
her to communicate

00:29:51.296 --> 00:29:52.996 A:middle
about her lunch on Avaz.

00:29:52.996 --> 00:29:54.996 A:middle
But it was very clear
that, you know,

00:29:54.996 --> 00:29:56.266 A:middle
that was not what she
was trying to say.

00:29:57.206 --> 00:29:59.476 A:middle
So we were all standing
there and trying to figure

00:29:59.476 --> 00:30:01.566 A:middle
out what she meant
by the word "eat".


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.476 --> 00:30:01.566 A:middle
out what she meant
by the word "eat".

00:30:01.636 --> 00:30:05.006 A:middle
And then her mother started
asking her questions.

00:30:06.396 --> 00:30:08.816 A:middle
So her mother said,
"OK, eat what?

00:30:09.296 --> 00:30:09.956 A:middle
Eat lunch?

00:30:10.006 --> 00:30:10.656 A:middle
Eat breakfast?

00:30:10.746 --> 00:30:11.496 A:middle
Eat snacks?"

00:30:12.126 --> 00:30:14.936 A:middle
And then the girl took out her
iPad, and she took out Avaz

00:30:14.936 --> 00:30:16.416 A:middle
and she pointed to
the word "ice cream".

00:30:17.646 --> 00:30:19.596 A:middle
And then her mother
asked, "OK, who eats?

00:30:19.736 --> 00:30:21.576 A:middle
You eat? Someone else eats?"

00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:24.506 A:middle
You know? And then she
pointed to the word "I".

00:30:24.506 --> 00:30:27.356 A:middle
And then her mother
was like, "Eat when?

00:30:27.356 --> 00:30:28.256 A:middle
Eat now? Eat later?"

00:30:28.256 --> 00:30:31.106 A:middle
And it turned out that
this particular girl wanted

00:30:31.136 --> 00:30:33.616 A:middle
to eat ice cream on her
way back home from school.

00:30:34.636 --> 00:30:37.786 A:middle
Now it's not often that
I can pinpoint the moment

00:30:37.786 --> 00:30:39.376 A:middle
when the lightbulb
goes off in my head.

00:30:39.656 --> 00:30:42.836 A:middle
But in this particular case,
I remember this episode almost

00:30:42.836 --> 00:30:43.756 A:middle
like it happened yesterday.

00:30:44.706 --> 00:30:49.266 A:middle
Because what struck me was
that feeling of realization --

00:30:49.266 --> 00:30:53.416 A:middle
that realization that this
mother had gotten this girl

00:30:53.416 --> 00:30:56.966 A:middle
to communicate what she
wanted without using grammar.

00:30:58.616 --> 00:31:02.026 A:middle
I mean, this girl could not put
more than one word together.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.616 --> 00:31:02.026 A:middle
I mean, this girl could not put
more than one word together.

00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:04.366 A:middle
She could not put multiple words
together to create sentences.

00:31:04.436 --> 00:31:06.436 A:middle
She could not select
different forms of words.

00:31:06.736 --> 00:31:08.386 A:middle
She did not know what
the meaning of "to" was.

00:31:08.926 --> 00:31:12.846 A:middle
She did not know the way in
which English grammar worked.

00:31:12.846 --> 00:31:16.426 A:middle
It's almost as if her mother had
peered into her head and figured

00:31:16.426 --> 00:31:21.936 A:middle
out what the meaning was
that she wanted to convey.

00:31:21.936 --> 00:31:24.776 A:middle
So this was the other
part of the puzzle for me.

00:31:25.476 --> 00:31:27.386 A:middle
You know, and I took this idea

00:31:27.386 --> 00:31:31.056 A:middle
that we could really represent
meaning without grammar

00:31:31.516 --> 00:31:34.536 A:middle
if we joined words together
using questions and answers.

00:31:34.736 --> 00:31:37.886 A:middle
And I combined that with
the algorithms that came

00:31:37.886 --> 00:31:42.116 A:middle
from my study of Panini and all
of the resource in linguistics

00:31:42.116 --> 00:31:43.946 A:middle
and the resource in
neuroscience that had been

00:31:43.946 --> 00:31:44.936 A:middle
over the last few years.

00:31:45.646 --> 00:31:48.786 A:middle
And I put that together
to create an app.

00:31:48.786 --> 00:31:51.296 A:middle
It took me three years to
actually create this app.

00:31:51.296 --> 00:31:52.646 A:middle
I started in 2012.

00:31:52.646 --> 00:31:55.256 A:middle
It was in 2015 that the
pieces finally came together.

00:31:55.356 --> 00:31:59.716 A:middle
And in 2016, we put
this app out --

00:31:59.806 --> 00:32:01.166 A:middle
this year, just a
few months ago.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.806 --> 00:32:01.166 A:middle
this year, just a
few months ago.

00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:03.486 A:middle
It's called FreeSpeech.

00:32:04.076 --> 00:32:07.136 A:middle
And let me show you a quick
demo of FreeSpeech to explain

00:32:07.136 --> 00:32:08.866 A:middle
to you how we solved
this problem.

00:32:20.206 --> 00:32:21.936 A:middle
OK, so this is the
FreeSpeech App.

00:32:22.156 --> 00:32:25.146 A:middle
And you can see that it
has pictures the same way

00:32:25.146 --> 00:32:26.346 A:middle
that Avaz has pictures.

00:32:26.346 --> 00:32:29.146 A:middle
In fact, if I tap on the
More Words button here

00:32:29.146 --> 00:32:32.956 A:middle
on the bottom-left, it has all
of the pictures that Avaz has.

00:32:33.746 --> 00:32:36.406 A:middle
But unlike Avaz, when
you construct a sentence

00:32:36.406 --> 00:32:39.066 A:middle
in FreeSpeech, you
don't have to start

00:32:39.066 --> 00:32:40.456 A:middle
at the beginning
of the sentence.

00:32:40.456 --> 00:32:42.356 A:middle
In fact, you can start
anywhere in the sentence.

00:32:42.356 --> 00:32:45.586 A:middle
So, for example, supposing
I pick the word "take"

00:32:46.746 --> 00:32:48.726 A:middle
and I drop it here
on the screen.

00:32:49.176 --> 00:32:50.166 A:middle
Here's the interesting part.

00:32:50.376 --> 00:32:50.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Take

00:32:51.376 --> 00:32:55.626 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The app actually gives you
this lattice this scaffold

00:32:56.106 --> 00:32:59.236 A:middle
of questions around the word
that you've just dropped


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:00.086 --> 00:33:02.986 A:middle
so that you can add more words
to create a sentence out of it.

00:33:02.986 --> 00:33:05.666 A:middle
It's very similar to what
the girl's mother was doing.

00:33:05.666 --> 00:33:08.886 A:middle
For example, if I drag
the word "teacher"

00:33:09.086 --> 00:33:11.706 A:middle
and I put it into
the word "who".

00:33:12.186 --> 00:33:13.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The teacher takes.

00:33:13.786 --> 00:33:15.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; It automatically
constructs a sentence

00:33:16.256 --> 00:33:17.706 A:middle
with that specific meaning.

00:33:17.706 --> 00:33:18.806 A:middle
It says, "The teacher takes."

00:33:19.306 --> 00:33:22.506 A:middle
I can take the word "book", and
if I put it into the "what",

00:33:22.816 --> 00:33:25.496 A:middle
it will say, "The
teacher takes the book."

00:33:25.696 --> 00:33:29.186 A:middle
And if I take the word "school"
and if I drop it on the word

00:33:29.286 --> 00:33:34.506 A:middle
"to", it will say, "The teacher
takes the book to the school."

00:33:35.286 --> 00:33:38.076 A:middle
Let me show you a slightly
more complicated example.

00:33:38.326 --> 00:33:41.306 A:middle
So, supposing we pick the
word "want", and let's put

00:33:41.306 --> 00:33:44.376 A:middle
that in here, it pops up
all of these questions.

00:33:45.386 --> 00:33:49.026 A:middle
And I can take the word "parent"
and I put it into the "who".

00:33:49.026 --> 00:33:50.636 A:middle
If I put into "want",
for example,

00:33:50.636 --> 00:33:52.326 A:middle
it will say, "Want the parent."

00:33:52.506 --> 00:33:55.896 A:middle
But if I took that from that
location and if I put it

00:33:55.896 --> 00:33:58.526 A:middle
into the "who", it will
say, "The parent wants."

00:33:58.526 --> 00:34:00.146 A:middle
And you see that every
time you add a word,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:58.526 --> 00:34:00.146 A:middle
And you see that every
time you add a word,

00:34:00.236 --> 00:34:02.366 A:middle
it actually gives you
even more questions.

00:34:02.366 --> 00:34:03.496 A:middle
So more questions pop up.

00:34:03.496 --> 00:34:05.276 A:middle
So you can see that
there's a "whose"

00:34:05.276 --> 00:34:07.346 A:middle
which is next to "parent".

00:34:07.346 --> 00:34:09.766 A:middle
So if I tap that, it will
ask you the question,

00:34:09.766 --> 00:34:10.666 A:middle
"Whose parent wants?"

00:34:10.666 --> 00:34:13.116 A:middle
And then I can drag the
word "she", for example,

00:34:13.116 --> 00:34:14.485 A:middle
and drop that in here.

00:34:14.485 --> 00:34:16.386 A:middle
It will say, "Her parent wants."

00:34:16.835 --> 00:34:20.036 A:middle
If I tap this little button on
the top-left corner of "parent",

00:34:20.036 --> 00:34:21.755 A:middle
I can convert that
into a plural.

00:34:21.755 --> 00:34:24.206 A:middle
So I can make it,
"Her parents want."

00:34:24.815 --> 00:34:28.416 A:middle
If I add the word "see",
for example, I can say,

00:34:28.416 --> 00:34:30.866 A:middle
"Her parents want to see."

00:34:30.866 --> 00:34:33.516 A:middle
And I can drag the word
"you" and I can make it,

00:34:33.516 --> 00:34:35.216 A:middle
"Her parents want to see you."

00:34:36.096 --> 00:34:38.005 A:middle
In fact, I can do even more
complicated things here.

00:34:38.146 --> 00:34:41.226 A:middle
I can say that all of
this happened in the past.

00:34:41.485 --> 00:34:43.806 A:middle
And I don't have to use the
rules of grammar to do this.

00:34:43.866 --> 00:34:45.416 A:middle
All I can do is I
can tap the button

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:46.356 A:middle
at the bottom that says Past.

00:34:46.356 --> 00:34:50.636 A:middle
It will say, "Her parents
wanted to see you."

00:34:51.045 --> 00:34:52.016 A:middle
And I can negate that.

00:34:52.016 --> 00:34:54.576 A:middle
So if I press the Not button
at the bottom, it will say,

00:34:54.576 --> 00:34:57.166 A:middle
"Her parents didn't
want to see you."

00:34:57.816 --> 00:34:59.176 A:middle
I can make a question out of it.

00:34:59.176 --> 00:35:01.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Didn't her parents
didn't want to see you.

&gt;&gt; Didn't her parents
didn't want to see you.

00:35:01.276 --> 00:35:03.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Or I can make even more
complicated questions.

[ Applause ]

00:35:07.086 --> 00:35:08.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Why didn't her
parents want to see you.

00:35:12.046 --> 00:35:12.346 A:middle
Thank you.

00:35:13.616 --> 00:35:13.986 A:middle
Thank you.

00:35:14.366 --> 00:35:15.616 A:middle
So that's how FreeSpeech works.

00:35:15.616 --> 00:35:17.216 A:middle
And FreeSpeech is pretty amazing

00:35:17.826 --> 00:35:20.056 A:middle
because I think it's
the very first time

00:35:20.056 --> 00:35:23.056 A:middle
that someone has actually come
up with a grammar predictor.

00:35:23.956 --> 00:35:25.176 A:middle
That's what the app
is doing, right?

00:35:25.176 --> 00:35:26.866 A:middle
I mean, you have all of
these different pictures

00:35:26.866 --> 00:35:29.246 A:middle
and the app is putting
grammar around it.

00:35:29.976 --> 00:35:32.026 A:middle
Now why is that important
for kids with autism?

00:35:32.426 --> 00:35:35.506 A:middle
The best way to kind of explain
that is to draw an analogy

00:35:35.506 --> 00:35:36.656 A:middle
to a different disability.

00:35:36.786 --> 00:35:39.126 A:middle
I'm sure many of you here
have heard of dyslexia.

00:35:39.506 --> 00:35:40.666 A:middle
Some of you may have
even struggled

00:35:40.666 --> 00:35:41.506 A:middle
with it when you were kids.

00:35:42.086 --> 00:35:44.546 A:middle
Kids with dyslexia have a lot
of difficulty with spelling.

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.556 A:middle
You know, English
spelling is horrible.

00:35:46.616 --> 00:35:48.376 A:middle
I have difficulty
with English spelling.

00:35:49.116 --> 00:35:51.996 A:middle
But if you give a kid
with dyslexia an iPad

00:35:51.996 --> 00:35:54.086 A:middle
and you ask them to type,

00:35:55.206 --> 00:35:57.336 A:middle
magically their disability
goes away.

00:35:57.706 --> 00:36:00.076 A:middle
Why? Because of spell check.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:57.706 --> 00:36:00.076 A:middle
Why? Because of spell check.

00:36:00.226 --> 00:36:01.116 A:middle
Because of autocorrect.

00:36:02.206 --> 00:36:05.056 A:middle
So a kid with dyslexia who
is typing on an iPad is able

00:36:05.056 --> 00:36:08.236 A:middle
to communicate, is able to type
perfectly correct English even

00:36:08.236 --> 00:36:09.516 A:middle
though they have
difficulties with spelling.

00:36:09.516 --> 00:36:12.306 A:middle
Avaz does exactly that for kids

00:36:12.306 --> 00:36:14.836 A:middle
who have a language
disability like autism.

00:36:15.676 --> 00:36:17.446 A:middle
It plays to their strengths.

00:36:17.806 --> 00:36:20.456 A:middle
They're able to take
pictures, they're able to pick

00:36:20.456 --> 00:36:26.176 A:middle
out pictures from the tablet,
and they're able to put pictures

00:36:26.176 --> 00:36:28.016 A:middle
in different configurations.

00:36:28.706 --> 00:36:29.666 A:middle
But every time they do that,

00:36:30.116 --> 00:36:33.746 A:middle
the algorithm is automatically
creating a perfectly-grammatical

00:36:33.746 --> 00:36:36.906 A:middle
sentence and is speaking
that out.

00:36:37.976 --> 00:36:41.516 A:middle
Now, we did trials for about
an entire year before we put

00:36:42.576 --> 00:36:43.926 A:middle
FreeSpeech out on the market.

00:36:44.426 --> 00:36:46.256 A:middle
And the results with kids

00:36:46.256 --> 00:36:48.306 A:middle
with autism were dramatic
-- truly dramatic.

00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:50.856 A:middle
There were kids who were
communicating with no words

00:36:50.856 --> 00:36:52.306 A:middle
or they were communicating
with one word.

00:36:52.786 --> 00:36:54.246 A:middle
And suddenly, in minutes --

00:36:54.296 --> 00:36:56.346 A:middle
literally minutes after they
started using the app --

00:36:56.396 --> 00:36:58.766 A:middle
they were constructing these
four or five-word sentences.

00:36:58.836 --> 00:37:01.566 A:middle
In fact, there was this
one particular kid --

00:36:58.836 --> 00:37:01.566 A:middle
In fact, there was this
one particular kid --

00:37:01.566 --> 00:37:03.116 A:middle
I want to show you
a video of this kid.

00:37:03.726 --> 00:37:08.576 A:middle
This kid was in -- you know,
he was using, you know,

00:37:08.576 --> 00:37:09.806 A:middle
single words to communicate.

00:37:10.156 --> 00:37:15.736 A:middle
And you can see that he's not
just using FreeSpeech very

00:37:15.826 --> 00:37:16.986 A:middle
fluently, but he's actually --

00:37:17.836 --> 00:37:20.156 A:middle
FreeSpeech is teaching
him to talk.

00:37:20.686 --> 00:37:22.496 A:middle
Let's look at the video.

00:37:25.256 --> 00:37:26.536 A:middle

You know, this kid was in --

00:38:34.106 --> 00:38:36.026 A:middle
this is a kid in
Portland, in Oregon.

00:38:36.026 --> 00:38:39.906 A:middle
And this kid's speech
therapist, you know,

00:38:39.906 --> 00:38:41.336 A:middle
he was completely
blown away by this.

00:38:41.336 --> 00:38:44.836 A:middle
In fact, his therapist
-- his name was Lucas.

00:38:45.236 --> 00:38:47.816 A:middle
You know, before Lucas
became a speech therapist,

00:38:47.816 --> 00:38:48.616 A:middle
he was a linguist.

00:38:49.236 --> 00:38:50.836 A:middle
And so he sent this video to us.

00:38:51.526 --> 00:38:53.976 A:middle
And to say he was blown
away is an understatement

00:38:53.976 --> 00:38:56.526 A:middle
because the same day that I
got this video, I got an email

00:38:56.526 --> 00:38:59.486 A:middle

quit his job and join my team.

in speech therapy in autism.

00:39:06.236 --> 00:39:13.116 A:middle
In fact, when we put
FreeSpeech out, you know,

00:39:13.376 --> 00:39:15.206 A:middle
Lucas also had a
very interesting idea

00:39:16.076 --> 00:39:18.226 A:middle
because Lucas had this
other kid on his caseload.

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:21.346 A:middle
And this other kid had a --
you know, he was an Avaz user

00:39:21.346 --> 00:39:23.436 A:middle
but he was facing a very
different kind of problem.

00:39:24.296 --> 00:39:25.796 A:middle
This other kid that was

00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:28.836 A:middle
on Lucas' caseload,
he was bilingual.

00:39:29.026 --> 00:39:31.796 A:middle
He came from a bilingual
family --

00:39:31.986 --> 00:39:33.416 A:middle
bilingual, English and Spanish.

00:39:34.136 --> 00:39:36.846 A:middle
So, at school, he would
be learning in English.

00:39:36.906 --> 00:39:38.456 A:middle
All of his teachers would
talk to him in English.

00:39:38.486 --> 00:39:42.916 A:middle
But when he went back home, his
family, and all of his friends,

00:39:42.916 --> 00:39:44.896 A:middle
and all of his neighbors, they
would be speaking in Spanish.

00:39:46.376 --> 00:39:50.156 A:middle
Now this is a challenge that
speech therapists have battled

00:39:50.156 --> 00:39:52.096 A:middle
with for many, many years.

00:39:52.246 --> 00:39:55.486 A:middle

00:40:08.686 --> 00:40:12.166 A:middle
So, let me give you a short demo
of why exactly that's a problem.

00:40:12.166 --> 00:40:15.616 A:middle
Let me go back into
Avaz and explain

00:40:15.616 --> 00:40:19.606 A:middle
to you what the issue is.

00:40:19.606 --> 00:40:20.586 A:middle
So, this is Avaz, right?

00:40:20.586 --> 00:40:22.336 A:middle
So we looked at the
-- I'm just going

00:40:22.336 --> 00:40:24.136 A:middle
to create a very quick sentence.

00:40:24.136 --> 00:40:28.656 A:middle
I'm going to say, "I want
to," and I go to Actions.

00:40:28.656 --> 00:40:29.916 A:middle
And let's say, "I
want to go home."

00:40:30.026 --> 00:40:33.676 A:middle
Right? So I pick out these
different words here.

00:40:34.026 --> 00:40:36.656 A:middle
And so let's say that a kid
is able to make this sentence,

00:40:36.656 --> 00:40:38.476 A:middle
"I want to go home,"
and they can speak it.

00:40:38.696 --> 00:40:42.976 A:middle
Now there is a Spanish
version of Avaz available,

00:40:42.976 --> 00:40:45.666 A:middle
so let me switch into
that very quickly.

00:40:46.346 --> 00:40:49.096 A:middle
So -- yeah.

00:40:49.846 --> 00:40:52.786 A:middle
How many Spanish
speakers in the audience?

00:40:53.526 --> 00:40:55.816 A:middle
OK. I don't know Spanish at all.

00:40:55.816 --> 00:40:56.906 A:middle
I know zero Spanish.

00:40:57.136 --> 00:41:01.176 A:middle
But, you know, I'm going
to try to use the pictures

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:57.136 --> 00:41:01.176 A:middle
But, you know, I'm going
to try to use the pictures

00:41:01.696 --> 00:41:04.656 A:middle
to create a Spanish sentence
of exactly the same thing.

00:41:05.036 --> 00:41:06.036 A:middle
So, let's see.

00:41:06.036 --> 00:41:07.596 A:middle
So I have the picture
for the word "I".

00:41:07.976 --> 00:41:09.056 A:middle
I can recognize that.

00:41:09.056 --> 00:41:09.516 A:middle
That's here.

00:41:09.516 --> 00:41:11.796 A:middle
And then I have "want".

00:41:12.246 --> 00:41:15.606 A:middle
And this looks like the
picture for the word "to".

00:41:16.356 --> 00:41:17.746 A:middle
And this is "go".

00:41:18.496 --> 00:41:21.166 A:middle
And so there's places in here.

00:41:21.166 --> 00:41:24.646 A:middle
And this is "home".

00:41:26.116 --> 00:41:29.916 A:middle
Is that the right
sentence in Spanish?

00:41:29.916 --> 00:41:34.416 A:middle
If I went to Mexico and if I
said this, a kid would laugh

00:41:34.416 --> 00:41:37.106 A:middle
at me because this is
completely grammatically wrong.

00:41:38.406 --> 00:41:40.616 A:middle
You see, I've actually
done a pretty good job

00:41:40.616 --> 00:41:42.746 A:middle
of picking the right
words out the words --

00:41:42.746 --> 00:41:44.626 A:middle
the words "I", "want", "go".

00:41:44.626 --> 00:41:45.506 A:middle
All of these are correct.

00:41:46.176 --> 00:41:49.646 A:middle
But in Spanish, the way that the
words work is very different.

00:41:49.646 --> 00:41:54.126 A:middle
For example, the word "querer"
-- the word that means "want" --

00:41:54.606 --> 00:41:57.006 A:middle
you actually have to inflect
that so it becomes "quiero"

00:41:57.546 --> 00:41:59.806 A:middle
when you use it for
the word "I".


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:00.456 --> 00:42:02.196 A:middle
And similarly, you
don't use the word "tu"

00:42:02.456 --> 00:42:04.736 A:middle
in Spanish the same way that
you use it with English.

00:42:04.736 --> 00:42:06.416 A:middle
You'd actually put that
word before the word

00:42:06.476 --> 00:42:09.046 A:middle
"casa" to say "tu home".

00:42:09.566 --> 00:42:12.736 A:middle
So the problem here is
that when you switch

00:42:12.736 --> 00:42:14.176 A:middle
between two different languages,

00:42:14.176 --> 00:42:15.886 A:middle
the interface actually
looks very similar.

00:42:15.886 --> 00:42:16.856 A:middle
And you can see that, right?

00:42:17.006 --> 00:42:18.926 A:middle
The Avaz interface
looks almost identical

00:42:18.926 --> 00:42:20.186 A:middle
between the two languages.

00:42:21.126 --> 00:42:24.106 A:middle
But the user experience is
actually completely different

00:42:24.196 --> 00:42:26.626 A:middle
because kids have to learn
completely different patterns

00:42:26.626 --> 00:42:28.326 A:middle
to be able to construct
these sentences

00:42:28.326 --> 00:42:29.586 A:middle
and to be able to
put them together.

00:42:30.386 --> 00:42:35.336 A:middle
So this was a problem that
not just my friend, Lucas,

00:42:35.336 --> 00:42:37.486 A:middle
but really everyone
who was working

00:42:37.486 --> 00:42:38.486 A:middle
with kids with disabilities.

00:42:38.796 --> 00:42:42.846 A:middle
Essentially, the child had to
learn two different patterns

00:42:43.126 --> 00:42:46.016 A:middle
of using the same app for them
to be able to communicate.

00:42:47.206 --> 00:42:49.326 A:middle
So the idea that kind of
went off in our heads was,

00:42:49.326 --> 00:42:51.556 A:middle
"Can we use FreeSpeech
to be able to do this?"

00:42:52.226 --> 00:42:54.266 A:middle
FreeSpeech is essentially,
in some sense,

00:42:54.346 --> 00:42:56.376 A:middle
a representation of meaning.

00:42:56.376 --> 00:42:58.176 A:middle
Right? So the way that you
put these words together,

00:42:58.176 --> 00:42:59.816 A:middle
the way that you
construct these sentences,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:00.306 --> 00:43:02.436 A:middle
they're essentially
conveying what the meaning is

00:43:02.436 --> 00:43:03.526 A:middle
that you're trying to say.

00:43:03.686 --> 00:43:05.376 A:middle
And the app is putting
the words together.

00:43:05.376 --> 00:43:09.416 A:middle
So can we use that to be able to
help kids construct sentences,

00:43:09.416 --> 00:43:12.086 A:middle
you know, even if they
have a different language?

00:43:12.086 --> 00:43:13.416 A:middle
So I'm going to go
into the Settings here,

00:43:13.416 --> 00:43:14.976 A:middle
and there's a Spanish
setting here.

00:43:15.756 --> 00:43:17.976 A:middle
And you can see that,
when you do that,

00:43:17.976 --> 00:43:20.126 A:middle
the interface completely
changes into Spanish.

00:43:21.596 --> 00:43:23.756 A:middle
And all the words
are in Spanish.

00:43:24.356 --> 00:43:26.366 A:middle
The labels are in
Spanish and everything.

00:43:26.506 --> 00:43:28.996 A:middle
And when I drag a word
and I put it in here,

00:43:28.996 --> 00:43:32.486 A:middle
all of the interface elements
here are in Spanish as well.

00:43:32.846 --> 00:43:36.056 A:middle
The questions are in Spanish,
the tenses, everything.

00:43:36.586 --> 00:43:37.606 A:middle
But here's the interesting part.

00:43:37.946 --> 00:43:39.796 A:middle

&gt;&gt; It actually gives me an
English sentence as the output.

00:43:45.096 --> 00:43:49.866 A:middle
So I can say -- so if I want to
try to make the same sentence,

00:43:50.146 --> 00:43:52.016 A:middle
I can take the same words

00:43:52.016 --> 00:43:53.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I want to go.

00:43:53.116 --> 00:43:54.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I can put that in here.

00:43:54.836 --> 00:43:58.246 A:middle
And I'm following exactly
the same user interface.

00:48:26.126 --> 00:48:27.426 A:middle
Well, number 3 was Arabic.

00:48:28.656 --> 00:48:29.506 A:middle
Any Arabic speakers?

00:48:31.296 --> 00:48:32.686 A:middle
Number 2 was Korean.

00:48:33.766 --> 00:48:36.686 A:middle
And number 1 was Japanese.

00:48:38.526 --> 00:48:39.776 A:middle
Any Japanese speakers here?

00:48:40.896 --> 00:48:41.926 A:middle
OK, wow. All right.

00:48:42.526 --> 00:48:45.976 A:middle
So, the native Japanese
speakers here, congratulations.

00:48:46.196 --> 00:48:48.506 A:middle
The NSA thinks yours is the most
difficult language to learn.

00:48:48.506 --> 00:48:49.986 A:middle
And by the time you
were three years old,

00:48:50.346 --> 00:48:51.896 A:middle
you were speaking
Japanese fluently.

00:48:52.286 --> 00:48:58.016 A:middle
You know, why do kids
learn language so easily?

00:48:58.016 --> 00:48:59.956 A:middle
It always frustrates me.

00:48:59.956 --> 00:49:01.356 A:middle
It always makes me very jealous.

00:48:59.956 --> 00:49:01.356 A:middle
It always makes me very jealous.

00:49:01.356 --> 00:49:02.316 A:middle
You know, I have a little son.

00:49:02.316 --> 00:49:03.326 A:middle
He's one and a half years old.

00:49:03.756 --> 00:49:07.556 A:middle
And I know that in another
one and a half years,

00:49:07.886 --> 00:49:11.106 A:middle
he'll be speaking
completely fluently.

00:49:11.106 --> 00:49:14.106 A:middle
And it's always been
a source of puzzlement

00:49:14.106 --> 00:49:15.426 A:middle
to me in why they do that.

00:49:15.966 --> 00:49:18.586 A:middle
What the theory says
-- what the theory

00:49:18.586 --> 00:49:19.766 A:middle
of language acquisition says --

00:49:19.766 --> 00:49:22.886 A:middle
is that kids learn a
language much faster

00:49:22.886 --> 00:49:25.336 A:middle
and much more effectively
than adults

00:49:25.336 --> 00:49:26.696 A:middle
because they're immersed in it.

00:49:27.196 --> 00:49:30.696 A:middle
You know, they hear it,
they try to speak it,

00:49:31.106 --> 00:49:33.386 A:middle
and they know what the meaning
is of what's being said to them

00:49:33.386 --> 00:49:35.046 A:middle
because they understand
the context

00:49:35.046 --> 00:49:35.876 A:middle
in which it's being said.

00:49:37.206 --> 00:49:39.566 A:middle
What if we could
simulate emotion

00:49:39.566 --> 00:49:43.836 A:middle
and provide the same capability
to adults and older children?

00:49:44.996 --> 00:49:47.966 A:middle
That's why I'm excited about
the prospect of FreeSpeech.

00:49:47.966 --> 00:49:49.986 A:middle
Because with FreeSpeech,
you're making these sentences,

00:49:50.266 --> 00:49:51.516 A:middle
and you know what the meaning is

00:49:51.516 --> 00:49:53.116 A:middle
because you're using
pictures as a bridge.

00:49:53.866 --> 00:49:56.296 A:middle
And every time you make
sentences in FreeSpeech,

00:49:56.806 --> 00:49:59.126 A:middle
the app is telling you
what the sentence means

00:49:59.476 --> 00:50:00.946 A:middle
in the language you're
trying to learn.

in the language you're

00:50:00.946 --> 00:50:03.856 A:middle
That's the interesting thing,

00:50:03.856 --> 00:50:05.656 A:middle
and that's what we're
working on.

00:50:07.076 --> 00:50:10.396 A:middle
You know, language is something

00:50:10.396 --> 00:50:13.566 A:middle
which is really interesting
for multiple reasons.

00:50:14.126 --> 00:50:19.476 A:middle
In this connected world
where anyone anywhere

00:50:19.476 --> 00:50:23.546 A:middle
in the world is two clicks away
on Facebook or on WhatsApp,

00:50:24.506 --> 00:50:26.386 A:middle
language is really
the last barrier

00:50:26.386 --> 00:50:27.556 A:middle
that we have as a species.

00:50:28.356 --> 00:50:29.586 A:middle
I mean, think about it.

00:50:29.586 --> 00:50:32.096 A:middle
Right? How many of
you have a friend

00:50:32.726 --> 00:50:34.736 A:middle
with whom you don't
share any language?

00:50:36.956 --> 00:50:40.636 A:middle
You know, communication
is the fundamental barrier

00:50:40.636 --> 00:50:42.656 A:middle
that children with
disabilities are born with.

00:50:42.656 --> 00:50:46.446 A:middle
But it's also the last barrier
that we have to cross as people.

00:50:46.446 --> 00:50:48.786 A:middle
And that's why the
work that I do is

00:50:48.786 --> 00:50:50.716 A:middle
so satisfying and
exciting to me.

00:50:51.546 --> 00:50:55.436 A:middle
You know, I build apps that
help kids with disabilities,

00:50:55.746 --> 00:51:00.206 A:middle
kids with disadvantaged
education backgrounds, refugees.

kids with disadvantaged

00:51:00.206 --> 00:51:04.306 A:middle
You know, I build apps
that use Apple's devices

00:51:04.306 --> 00:51:05.816 A:middle
to make the lives of
these people better.

00:51:06.616 --> 00:51:08.026 A:middle
But I'm hopeful that
some of the work

00:51:08.026 --> 00:51:12.186 A:middle
that I'm doing could
also help all of us look

00:51:12.186 --> 00:51:14.556 A:middle
with a different light and
with a different appreciation

00:51:15.016 --> 00:51:18.366 A:middle
at the most beautiful,
most expressive

00:51:18.806 --> 00:51:21.016 A:middle
of human inventions -- language.

00:51:22.056 --> 00:51:22.396 A:middle
Thank you.
