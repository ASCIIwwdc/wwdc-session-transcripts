[ Applause ]

00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:27.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:29.556 A:middle
I'm Brad, and today
we are going to talk

00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:31.516 A:middle
about Core Location
best practices.

00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:34.886 A:middle
Now just so we're
all on the same page,

00:00:34.886 --> 00:00:36.186 A:middle
we're going to start
off by talking

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:38.356 A:middle
about the major features
of Core Location.

00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:42.196 A:middle
For veterans of our API,
this will be largely review.

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:44.706 A:middle
But for newcomers, it will be--

00:00:45.626 --> 00:00:47.086 A:middle
well, you'll want to
consult the documentation

00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:47.846 A:middle
after this session.

00:00:49.676 --> 00:00:52.586 A:middle
After that, we'll switch over
to talking about best practices

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:53.686 A:middle
for using Core Location.

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:56.886 A:middle
Now iOS is the only
platform where all

00:00:56.886 --> 00:01:00.146 A:middle
of our APIs are available, so
it will be our focus today.

00:00:56.886 --> 00:01:00.146 A:middle
of our APIs are available, so
it will be our focus today.

00:01:00.986 --> 00:01:04.706 A:middle
However, if you are interested
in macOS, tvOS or watchOS,

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:06.936 A:middle
you might want to stick
around, because a lot

00:01:06.936 --> 00:01:09.096 A:middle
of the content will be
applicable to those platforms,

00:01:09.096 --> 00:01:11.036 A:middle
and we'll talk about them
explicitly at the end.

00:01:13.526 --> 00:01:14.916 A:middle
With that, let's
get started talking

00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:16.746 A:middle
about Core Locations,
major features.

00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:20.176 A:middle
The first one is the
authorization API.

00:01:21.356 --> 00:01:24.586 A:middle
Now, you should know that the
authorization API is required

00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:26.816 A:middle
in order to access
the user's location.

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.136 A:middle
You've probably experienced
this as a user,

00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:31.966 A:middle
if you've ever seen a
prompt like this one.

00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:34.836 A:middle
Here, Core Location is
asking the user if they'd

00:01:34.836 --> 00:01:38.096 A:middle
like to authorize the camera
app to access their location.

00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:42.786 A:middle
We offer two different
versions of authorization

00:01:42.826 --> 00:01:44.026 A:middle
that your app can request.

00:01:44.806 --> 00:01:47.206 A:middle
The first one is
when-in-use authorization,

00:01:48.096 --> 00:01:49.346 A:middle
and just like it sounds like,

00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:51.736 A:middle
when your app receives
when-in-use authorization,

00:01:51.906 --> 00:01:55.216 A:middle
it is allowed to access the
user's location whenever it is

00:01:55.216 --> 00:01:55.826 A:middle
in use.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.756 A:middle
We'll define what it means to
be in use in just a moment.

00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:01.956 A:middle
If you'd like to request
when in use authorization,

00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:01.956 A:middle
If you'd like to request
when in use authorization,

00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:05.096 A:middle
you simply call the
requestWhenInUseAuthorization

00:02:05.096 --> 00:02:05.436 A:middle
method.

00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:09.466 A:middle
We also have
AlwaysAuthorization.

00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:12.216 A:middle
When your app has
AlwaysAuthorization,

00:02:12.426 --> 00:02:15.106 A:middle
it is permitted to access the
user's location whenever your

00:02:15.106 --> 00:02:15.916 A:middle
app is running.

00:02:16.856 --> 00:02:20.546 A:middle
To request it, you simply use
the requestAlwaysAuthorization

00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:20.866 A:middle
method.

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:24.976 A:middle
Whichever authorization
level you choose to request,

00:02:25.156 --> 00:02:27.366 A:middle
you must provide a
usage description

00:02:27.406 --> 00:02:29.266 A:middle
in your app's information
property list.

00:02:30.536 --> 00:02:33.296 A:middle
Core Location will pull this
string out of your info plist,

00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:34.966 A:middle
and display it to
the user as part

00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:38.746 A:middle
of the authorization prompt.

00:02:40.156 --> 00:02:45.756 A:middle
So when is your app
considered in use?

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.946 A:middle
Well, if your app is
in the foreground,

00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:49.556 A:middle
then we'll consider it in use.

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:53.166 A:middle
This is Potluck, our sample app.

00:02:54.136 --> 00:02:57.176 A:middle
If your app is in the
background, but has a blue bar,

00:02:57.336 --> 00:02:59.176 A:middle
then it will also be
considered in use.

00:03:00.326 --> 00:03:02.516 A:middle
If you're wondering about the
blue bar, we'll talk about that

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:03.596 A:middle
in just a few moments.

00:03:04.856 --> 00:03:09.376 A:middle
Finally, if your app is handling
WatchConnectivity messages,

00:03:09.586 --> 00:03:11.326 A:middle
from a foreground watchOS app,

00:03:11.656 --> 00:03:14.266 A:middle
then it will also be
considered in use.

00:03:16.236 --> 00:03:20.746 A:middle
Once your app has received
authorization from the user,

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:23.686 A:middle
it can use our location
sensitive APIs.

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:26.426 A:middle
The first one we are going
to talk about is the bread

00:03:26.426 --> 00:03:29.316 A:middle
and butter of Core Location,
the standard location service.

00:03:30.446 --> 00:03:31.926 A:middle
It comes in two different
versions.

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:35.416 A:middle
The first version is
the single location API.

00:03:37.026 --> 00:03:40.076 A:middle
When you call Request Location,
Core Location will do its best

00:03:40.076 --> 00:03:42.196 A:middle
to produce an estimate
of the user's position,

00:03:42.386 --> 00:03:44.096 A:middle
and then deliver that
to your delegate.

00:03:45.736 --> 00:03:48.666 A:middle
We also offer the
continuous location API.

00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:51.816 A:middle
When you call Start
Updating Location,

00:03:52.136 --> 00:03:55.076 A:middle
Core Location will produce a
stream of location updates,

00:03:55.076 --> 00:03:56.746 A:middle
and deliver them all
to your delegate.

00:03:58.676 --> 00:04:01.506 A:middle
Remember to stop your location
updates when you're done,

00:03:58.676 --> 00:04:01.506 A:middle
Remember to stop your location
updates when you're done,

00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:03.496 A:middle
since otherwise Core
Location will continue

00:04:03.496 --> 00:04:04.526 A:middle
to compute locations.

00:04:06.816 --> 00:04:08.706 A:middle
We have a few knobs
and dials you can turn

00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:10.876 A:middle
to adjust how the standard
location service works.

00:04:12.256 --> 00:04:13.716 A:middle
For example, Deferred Updates.

00:04:14.406 --> 00:04:16.476 A:middle
When you enable deferred
location updates,

00:04:16.846 --> 00:04:19.206 A:middle
you're telling Core Location
that it's acceptable for us

00:04:19.206 --> 00:04:22.316 A:middle
to deliver location updates
to your app in large batches.

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:25.306 A:middle
Sometimes we do this
for power reasons.

00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:31.216 A:middle
We also offer automatic pausing.

00:04:31.716 --> 00:04:32.926 A:middle
This is enabled by default.

00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:35.906 A:middle
What it does, is it
attempts to detect

00:04:35.966 --> 00:04:39.566 A:middle
when your location session
has outlived its usefulness

00:04:39.616 --> 00:04:40.306 A:middle
to some extent.

00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:41.896 A:middle
Let's consider an example.

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:45.126 A:middle
Suppose the user is
using a run tracking app,

00:04:45.746 --> 00:04:48.866 A:middle
and they go for a run, but when
they get home, they're tired,

00:04:49.096 --> 00:04:50.896 A:middle
and they just want to take a
shower, and they forget all

00:04:50.896 --> 00:04:52.726 A:middle
about stopping their
location session.

00:04:54.266 --> 00:04:56.286 A:middle
Now, unless the app
was specifically trying

00:04:56.286 --> 00:04:58.106 A:middle
to detect this sort
of situation,

00:04:58.646 --> 00:05:00.906 A:middle
it's likely that the
user's phone would continue

00:04:58.646 --> 00:05:00.906 A:middle
it's likely that the
user's phone would continue

00:05:00.906 --> 00:05:03.756 A:middle
to compute locations until
it runs out of power.

00:05:05.056 --> 00:05:07.336 A:middle
With automatic pausing,
Core Location will attempt

00:05:07.336 --> 00:05:08.846 A:middle
to detect situations like this,

00:05:09.176 --> 00:05:12.286 A:middle
and automatically stop
the location updates.

00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:16.646 A:middle
Core Location also
has special support

00:05:16.906 --> 00:05:21.446 A:middle
for using the standard location
service while in the background.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.796 A:middle
Once you engage one of
these special sessions,

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:26.446 A:middle
Core Location will keep your
app running and continue

00:05:26.446 --> 00:05:28.096 A:middle
to deliver location
updates to it.

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.616 A:middle
If your app has when-in-use
authorization,

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:34.306 A:middle
we'll automatically display
a blue bar at the top

00:05:34.306 --> 00:05:37.856 A:middle
of the screen, thus marking your
app as in use, and allowing it

00:05:37.856 --> 00:05:39.636 A:middle
to continue to receive
location updates.

00:05:41.656 --> 00:05:44.216 A:middle
An always authorized app will
still get this background

00:05:44.216 --> 00:05:46.406 A:middle
running behavior, but
it won't get a blue bar.

00:05:46.826 --> 00:05:49.186 A:middle
It's important to remember
to stop your location session

00:05:49.186 --> 00:05:51.096 A:middle
when you're done,
otherwise it will continue

00:05:51.096 --> 00:05:52.386 A:middle
potentially indefinitely.

00:05:54.976 --> 00:05:57.526 A:middle
In order to start one of
these background sessions,

00:05:57.576 --> 00:05:59.766 A:middle
there are three things
your app must do.

00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:03.636 A:middle
The first one is you must
enable background location

00:06:04.006 --> 00:06:05.526 A:middle
in your information
property list.

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:08.386 A:middle
Now, the easiest way to
do that is to navigate

00:06:08.386 --> 00:06:10.276 A:middle
to the capabilities
tab in Xcode,

00:06:11.236 --> 00:06:13.246 A:middle
scroll down to the
background mode section,

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:15.716 A:middle
and check the location
updates box.

00:06:17.136 --> 00:06:20.936 A:middle
Second, you must set your
allowed background location

00:06:20.936 --> 00:06:22.586 A:middle
updates property to true.

00:06:23.226 --> 00:06:25.796 A:middle
This indicates that that
particular location manager

00:06:26.046 --> 00:06:28.796 A:middle
would like to be able to start
a background location session.

00:06:30.796 --> 00:06:35.146 A:middle
Finally, you must start
your location updates while

00:06:35.146 --> 00:06:36.066 A:middle
in the foreground.

00:06:36.616 --> 00:06:38.456 A:middle
If you don't start your
updates in the foreground,

00:06:38.636 --> 00:06:40.126 A:middle
you won't get this
special behavior.

00:06:42.206 --> 00:06:45.216 A:middle
So what happens if you do start
your updates in the background?

00:06:46.056 --> 00:06:48.686 A:middle
Well, first off, your
app will probably need

00:06:48.686 --> 00:06:52.226 A:middle
AlwaysAuthorization since
your app won't be considered

00:06:52.226 --> 00:06:53.296 A:middle
in use at that time.

00:06:54.536 --> 00:06:57.216 A:middle
Furthermore, Core Location
won't take any action

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:59.936 A:middle
to ensure your app
continues to run.

00:07:01.746 --> 00:07:03.986 A:middle
So if you have background
runtime for some reason,

00:07:03.986 --> 00:07:05.846 A:middle
and you decide to start
a location session,

00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:07.216 A:middle
you might get some updates,

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:10.556 A:middle
but you might also get suspended
before you receive all the

00:07:10.556 --> 00:07:12.246 A:middle
information you had
hoped to receive.

00:07:12.826 --> 00:07:16.916 A:middle
After the standard
location service,

00:07:16.996 --> 00:07:19.826 A:middle
we have our background
monitoring APIs.

00:07:20.656 --> 00:07:23.126 A:middle
The first one we are going to
talk about is region monitoring.

00:07:24.116 --> 00:07:27.406 A:middle
Region monitoring allows your
app to specify a location

00:07:27.406 --> 00:07:30.096 A:middle
that is interesting to it,
and Core Location will attempt

00:07:30.096 --> 00:07:32.396 A:middle
to determine whenever
the user has arrived at

00:07:32.396 --> 00:07:33.856 A:middle
or departed from that location.

00:07:35.016 --> 00:07:37.346 A:middle
This will continue even
if your app is suspended

00:07:37.346 --> 00:07:40.236 A:middle
or in the background, and Core
Location will launch your app

00:07:40.236 --> 00:07:41.726 A:middle
into the background if necessary

00:07:41.726 --> 00:07:43.416 A:middle
to deliver information
about the event.

00:07:45.856 --> 00:07:48.536 A:middle
We have two different versions
of the region monitoring API.

00:07:49.656 --> 00:07:52.446 A:middle
First, we have circular
region monitoring.

00:07:53.356 --> 00:07:55.246 A:middle
When you start circular
region monitoring,

00:07:55.306 --> 00:07:57.626 A:middle
you describe a circular
geographic region

00:07:57.856 --> 00:08:00.546 A:middle
that is interesting to your app,
and Core Location will attempt

00:07:57.856 --> 00:08:00.546 A:middle
that is interesting to your app,
and Core Location will attempt

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:03.226 A:middle
to detect entries or exits
from that circular region.

00:08:04.846 --> 00:08:07.016 A:middle
We also have Beacon
region monitoring.

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:10.556 A:middle
Beacon region monitoring
attempts to detect proximity

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:13.506 A:middle
to iBeacon devices that match
a specification provided

00:08:13.506 --> 00:08:14.926 A:middle
by your app.

00:08:17.536 --> 00:08:18.826 A:middle
In either case,

00:08:18.916 --> 00:08:22.106 A:middle
region monitoring consumes
a limited system resource,

00:08:22.436 --> 00:08:24.486 A:middle
and so Core Location
only allows your app

00:08:24.526 --> 00:08:27.316 A:middle
to install a limited
number of regions.

00:08:28.146 --> 00:08:30.286 A:middle
However, keep in mind,
if you're writing an app

00:08:30.346 --> 00:08:31.866 A:middle
that uses Beacon
region monitoring,

00:08:32.246 --> 00:08:34.106 A:middle
a single beacon region
can monitor

00:08:34.106 --> 00:08:35.785 A:middle
from many iBeacon devices.

00:08:38.846 --> 00:08:40.796 A:middle
When you're ready to
start region monitoring,

00:08:41.056 --> 00:08:42.876 A:middle
you simply construct
a CL region,

00:08:42.936 --> 00:08:45.566 A:middle
either a CL beacon region
or a CL circular region,

00:08:45.936 --> 00:08:48.446 A:middle
and then pass it to the
startMonitoring(for:) method

00:08:48.606 --> 00:08:49.796 A:middle
on CL location manager.

00:08:51.296 --> 00:08:56.256 A:middle
When you're done, pass the same
region to stopMonitoring(for:).

00:08:58.736 --> 00:09:01.486 A:middle
If you want to use
region monitoring

00:08:58.736 --> 00:09:01.486 A:middle
If you want to use
region monitoring

00:09:01.486 --> 00:09:04.856 A:middle
to trigger a notification, you
might be interested to know

00:09:04.856 --> 00:09:07.826 A:middle
that the user notification
framework has special support

00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:10.906 A:middle
for this through their
UNLocationNotificationTrigger

00:09:11.106 --> 00:09:11.506 A:middle
class.

00:09:13.316 --> 00:09:17.356 A:middle
The user notification
framework is new in iOS 10,

00:09:18.156 --> 00:09:20.456 A:middle
but this functionality
was previously available

00:09:20.746 --> 00:09:22.396 A:middle
through UI local notification.

00:09:22.796 --> 00:09:24.246 A:middle
If you'd like to learn more

00:09:24.246 --> 00:09:27.046 A:middle
about the new user notification
framework, you might want

00:09:27.046 --> 00:09:29.906 A:middle
to view the Introduction to
Notifications session online.

00:09:31.296 --> 00:09:34.506 A:middle
Similarly, the HomeKit
framework has special support

00:09:34.856 --> 00:09:37.316 A:middle
for triggering a
HomeKit scene in response

00:09:37.316 --> 00:09:38.906 A:middle
to a region monitoring event.

00:09:40.226 --> 00:09:42.446 A:middle
The HM LocationEvent
allows you to do this.

00:09:42.726 --> 00:09:45.556 A:middle
If you'd like to learn more
about using HM location event,

00:09:45.606 --> 00:09:48.426 A:middle
I would encourage you to view
HomeKit session from last year.

00:09:48.736 --> 00:09:49.786 A:middle
You can find it online.

00:09:51.176 --> 00:09:54.756 A:middle
In either case, you only need
when-in-use authorization

00:09:54.756 --> 00:09:56.586 A:middle
to use the user notification
framework,

00:09:56.586 --> 00:09:59.636 A:middle
or the HomeKit framework special
support for region monitoring.

00:10:00.326 --> 00:10:01.786 A:middle
General purpose region
monitoring

00:10:01.786 --> 00:10:04.306 A:middle
through Core Location
requires AlwaysAuthorization.

00:10:07.736 --> 00:10:09.656 A:middle
Similar to Beacon
region monitoring,

00:10:09.726 --> 00:10:10.976 A:middle
we have Beacon ranging.

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:15.336 A:middle
Now, every iBeacon device
broadcasts three components

00:10:15.336 --> 00:10:20.096 A:middle
of information: A UUID, a
major ID, and a minor ID.

00:10:20.746 --> 00:10:24.006 A:middle
When a beacon region
event fires,

00:10:24.136 --> 00:10:27.336 A:middle
you usually don't receive all
three components of information.

00:10:28.186 --> 00:10:31.046 A:middle
Using Beacon ranging, you can
fill in the missing details.

00:10:32.126 --> 00:10:35.916 A:middle
Ranging is also useful for
determining an estimated range

00:10:35.916 --> 00:10:38.726 A:middle
from the user's device
to the iBeacon device.

00:10:40.076 --> 00:10:43.536 A:middle
Now, range estimates are most
accurate when your app is

00:10:43.536 --> 00:10:46.056 A:middle
in the foreground, but
you can use Beacon ranging

00:10:46.056 --> 00:10:46.816 A:middle
in the background.

00:10:47.886 --> 00:10:50.036 A:middle
If you do, however, keep in mind

00:10:50.036 --> 00:10:52.936 A:middle
that Core Location won't prevent
your app from being suspended,

00:10:53.216 --> 00:10:55.756 A:middle
and so you might be suspended
before you receive all the

00:10:55.756 --> 00:11:00.936 A:middle
information you had
hoped to receive.

00:10:55.756 --> 00:11:00.936 A:middle
information you had
hoped to receive.

00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:02.566 A:middle
As an aside, if you're
interested

00:11:02.566 --> 00:11:05.316 A:middle
in using iBeacon devices, I
would highly encourage you

00:11:05.316 --> 00:11:07.836 A:middle
to visit
developer.apple.com/ibeacon.

00:11:08.796 --> 00:11:11.646 A:middle
Once you agree to the iBeacon
license, you'll be able

00:11:11.646 --> 00:11:13.936 A:middle
to download the official
iBeacon specification

00:11:14.146 --> 00:11:16.906 A:middle
for what every well-behaved
iBeacon device must do.

00:11:19.836 --> 00:11:22.286 A:middle
The next background monitoring
API we are going to talk

00:11:22.286 --> 00:11:25.486 A:middle
about is the significant
location change monitoring API.

00:11:27.076 --> 00:11:29.656 A:middle
As the name would imply, this
monitor's for large changes

00:11:29.656 --> 00:11:32.616 A:middle
in the user's location on the
order of about a kilometer.

00:11:35.206 --> 00:11:37.616 A:middle
Since we introduced this,
quite a bit has changed

00:11:37.616 --> 00:11:39.196 A:middle
in Core Location,
and at this point,

00:11:39.196 --> 00:11:41.586 A:middle
we believe that it's
fairly unique.

00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:45.436 A:middle
A lot of apps that use
significant location change

00:11:45.436 --> 00:11:48.276 A:middle
monitoring would be better
served by visit monitoring.

00:11:48.836 --> 00:11:52.336 A:middle
On the topic of visit
monitoring,

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.806 A:middle
visit monitoring deploys
sophisticated algorithms

00:11:55.806 --> 00:11:59.176 A:middle
to monitor for places that the
user might consider a noteworthy

00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:00.076 A:middle
part of their day.

00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:00.076 A:middle
part of their day.

00:12:00.996 --> 00:12:03.086 A:middle
That's why we think many
apps would be better served

00:12:03.086 --> 00:12:03.996 A:middle
by visit monitoring.

00:12:04.226 --> 00:12:05.886 A:middle
After all, you're
usually interested

00:12:05.886 --> 00:12:08.266 A:middle
in where the user
stops and spends time,

00:12:08.726 --> 00:12:10.556 A:middle
rather than where
they happen to be

00:12:10.556 --> 00:12:13.086 A:middle
when Core Location has
detected a large change.

00:12:16.136 --> 00:12:17.846 A:middle
We've gone to great
lengths to ensure

00:12:17.846 --> 00:12:20.416 A:middle
that visit monitoring has
a fairly low power cost,

00:12:20.416 --> 00:12:22.096 A:middle
and so you should feel
comfortable using it

00:12:22.096 --> 00:12:23.366 A:middle
in an all-day scenario.

00:12:24.226 --> 00:12:28.646 A:middle
Like the rest of our
background monitoring APIs,

00:12:28.906 --> 00:12:31.586 A:middle
visit monitoring will continue
even when your app is suspended,

00:12:31.586 --> 00:12:33.276 A:middle
and will launch your
app in the background

00:12:33.276 --> 00:12:35.136 A:middle
to deliver event information.

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:39.076 A:middle
If you'd like to start
visit monitoring,

00:12:39.346 --> 00:12:41.816 A:middle
you simply call the
startMonitoringVisits method.

00:12:42.616 --> 00:12:45.746 A:middle
When you're done, call
stopMonitoringVisits.

00:12:47.556 --> 00:12:49.626 A:middle
The final API we
are going to talk

00:12:49.626 --> 00:12:51.536 A:middle
about today is the
geocoding API.

00:12:52.666 --> 00:12:54.876 A:middle
Core Location supports
both forward geocoding,

00:12:54.966 --> 00:12:57.246 A:middle
that is converting an
address into a coordinate,

00:12:57.976 --> 00:13:00.896 A:middle
and reverse geocoding, which
is converting coordinates

00:12:57.976 --> 00:13:00.896 A:middle
and reverse geocoding, which
is converting coordinates

00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:01.996 A:middle
into an address.

00:13:02.486 --> 00:13:06.026 A:middle
Unlike the rest of the APIs
we have talked about today,

00:13:06.406 --> 00:13:10.486 A:middle
geocoding does not require
user authorization, however,

00:13:10.886 --> 00:13:13.906 A:middle
if your app is authorized to
access the user's location,

00:13:14.516 --> 00:13:16.776 A:middle
will automatically
use that information

00:13:16.776 --> 00:13:18.736 A:middle
when performing forward
geocoding.

00:13:18.856 --> 00:13:21.066 A:middle
That is, converting an
address into coordinates.

00:13:23.396 --> 00:13:26.006 A:middle
The geocoding API
is rate limited,

00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:28.656 A:middle
and so you should try not to
send too many requests to it.

00:13:29.336 --> 00:13:33.666 A:middle
A great way to avoid hitting the
rate limit is the cache results

00:13:33.666 --> 00:13:35.066 A:middle
provided by the geocoder.

00:13:35.476 --> 00:13:36.526 A:middle
That way, you don't have to try

00:13:36.526 --> 00:13:40.806 A:middle
to geocode the same
information multiple times.

00:13:40.946 --> 00:13:43.556 A:middle
We also recommend
that you only geocode

00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:45.566 A:middle
in response to a user action.

00:13:45.916 --> 00:13:48.556 A:middle
For example, if the user
drops a pin on a map,

00:13:48.776 --> 00:13:51.306 A:middle
that's an excellent time
to geocode that location.

00:13:54.346 --> 00:13:56.936 A:middle
Okay, now that you're
familiar with all of our APIs,

00:13:56.936 --> 00:14:00.146 A:middle
let's take a look at
authorization again.

00:13:56.936 --> 00:14:00.146 A:middle
let's take a look at
authorization again.

00:14:01.146 --> 00:14:03.636 A:middle
If your app has when-in-use
authorization

00:14:03.806 --> 00:14:05.096 A:middle
or always authorization,

00:14:05.346 --> 00:14:07.256 A:middle
it can use the standard
location service,

00:14:08.366 --> 00:14:10.836 A:middle
those special background
location sessions, remember,

00:14:10.886 --> 00:14:12.376 A:middle
that is starting
in the foreground

00:14:12.436 --> 00:14:15.896 A:middle
and then entering the
background, and Beacon ranging.

00:14:16.406 --> 00:14:19.576 A:middle
If your app has always
authorization,

00:14:19.686 --> 00:14:22.556 A:middle
it can additionally use our
background monitoring APIs.

00:14:23.486 --> 00:14:25.706 A:middle
That is region monitoring,
visit monitoring,

00:14:25.706 --> 00:14:27.596 A:middle
and significant location
change monitoring.

00:14:28.556 --> 00:14:30.956 A:middle
Don't forget that the user
notification framework

00:14:30.956 --> 00:14:32.676 A:middle
and the HomeKit framework
allow you

00:14:32.676 --> 00:14:34.606 A:middle
to do special purpose
region monitoring

00:14:34.656 --> 00:14:36.126 A:middle
with when-in-use authorization.

00:14:39.446 --> 00:14:41.446 A:middle
As far as availability
is concerned,

00:14:42.156 --> 00:14:45.316 A:middle
all of our APIs are
available on iOS.

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:48.586 A:middle
On macOS, you can use the
standard location service,

00:14:49.536 --> 00:14:50.876 A:middle
circular region monitoring,

00:14:51.476 --> 00:14:54.396 A:middle
significant location change
monitoring and geocoding.

00:14:55.676 --> 00:14:59.106 A:middle
On watchOS, we support the
standard location service,

00:14:59.646 --> 00:15:02.396 A:middle
and geocoding, and
finally, on tvOS,

00:14:59.646 --> 00:15:02.396 A:middle
and geocoding, and
finally, on tvOS,

00:15:02.396 --> 00:15:11.136 A:middle
you can use the single location
API, and the geocoding API.

00:15:11.386 --> 00:15:14.336 A:middle
Alright, let's get started
talking about the best practices

00:15:14.336 --> 00:15:15.616 A:middle
for using Core Location.

00:15:18.736 --> 00:15:22.066 A:middle
The user's privacy is
the most important part

00:15:22.326 --> 00:15:23.676 A:middle
about using Core Location.

00:15:24.656 --> 00:15:26.986 A:middle
Location information
is highly sensitive.

00:15:27.576 --> 00:15:30.256 A:middle
It describes where we
live, where we work,

00:15:30.256 --> 00:15:31.586 A:middle
and who we spend our time with.

00:15:32.686 --> 00:15:35.496 A:middle
As such, you must
respect the user's privacy

00:15:35.496 --> 00:15:36.576 A:middle
when using Core Location.

00:15:36.996 --> 00:15:38.306 A:middle
And that is worth repeating.

00:15:38.586 --> 00:15:40.756 A:middle
You must respect
the user's privacy

00:15:40.786 --> 00:15:41.906 A:middle
when using Core Location.

00:15:42.966 --> 00:15:46.526 A:middle
Core Location helps facilitate
this using our authorization

00:15:46.526 --> 00:15:48.886 A:middle
system, but getting
the user's permission

00:15:48.886 --> 00:15:51.166 A:middle
to access your location,
sorry, their location,

00:15:52.026 --> 00:15:54.506 A:middle
is only the first step in
respecting their privacy.

00:15:56.806 --> 00:15:59.796 A:middle
You should make sure that your
app doesn't request any more

00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:03.666 A:middle
information than what it
absolutely needs in order

00:16:03.666 --> 00:16:05.286 A:middle
to satisfy a user request.

00:16:07.156 --> 00:16:09.126 A:middle
Similarly, you should
make it clear

00:16:09.126 --> 00:16:11.526 A:middle
to the user what
you're asking for

00:16:11.796 --> 00:16:14.046 A:middle
and how you intend to use it.

00:16:17.056 --> 00:16:19.626 A:middle
There are two concrete things
that your app should do

00:16:19.626 --> 00:16:21.176 A:middle
if it is going to
use Core Location.

00:16:22.536 --> 00:16:26.126 A:middle
First if you're going to talk
to a server you should attempt

00:16:26.126 --> 00:16:28.386 A:middle
to anonymize those queries
as much as possible.

00:16:29.086 --> 00:16:30.136 A:middle
Let's consider an example.

00:16:30.836 --> 00:16:33.386 A:middle
Say you're writing a
check-in application.

00:16:34.056 --> 00:16:36.556 A:middle
Well, if the user has
tapped the Check-in button,

00:16:36.896 --> 00:16:39.546 A:middle
then it makes sense that you
should send both user identity

00:16:39.546 --> 00:16:42.806 A:middle
information and location
to your server all at once,

00:16:42.986 --> 00:16:45.266 A:middle
since the user clearly wants
your server to know both.

00:16:46.266 --> 00:16:49.996 A:middle
However, if you're writing,
say, a weather application,

00:16:50.206 --> 00:16:52.756 A:middle
then the user probably
doesn't gain much benefit

00:16:52.756 --> 00:16:53.986 A:middle
from your server being able

00:16:53.986 --> 00:16:57.156 A:middle
to associate both
identity and location.

00:16:57.546 --> 00:16:59.106 A:middle
And so the user would
be better served

00:16:59.106 --> 00:17:01.516 A:middle
by an anonymous query
in that instance.

00:16:59.106 --> 00:17:01.516 A:middle
by an anonymous query
in that instance.

00:17:04.175 --> 00:17:07.685 A:middle
Additionally, if you plan on
persisting location information

00:17:07.685 --> 00:17:11.786 A:middle
to disc, you should use
the file protection APIs.

00:17:12.046 --> 00:17:13.906 A:middle
Now this one is relatively
simple,

00:17:13.906 --> 00:17:17.705 A:middle
since file protection is
enabled by default since iOS 8.

00:17:18.096 --> 00:17:21.136 A:middle
However, it is still possible
to create unprotected files,

00:17:21.846 --> 00:17:23.566 A:middle
and so you should make
sure that if you're going

00:17:23.566 --> 00:17:26.086 A:middle
to be persisting location
information, you should not do

00:17:26.086 --> 00:17:28.165 A:middle
so in an unprotected file.

00:17:33.076 --> 00:17:36.426 A:middle
After privacy, power is the
second most important thing

00:17:36.426 --> 00:17:38.066 A:middle
to consider when
using Core Location.

00:17:38.666 --> 00:17:43.566 A:middle
The power cost of using Core
Location is highly variable.

00:17:43.986 --> 00:17:47.586 A:middle
At one extreme, we have Beacon
region monitoring, which is,

00:17:47.586 --> 00:17:49.386 A:middle
for all intents and
purposes, free.

00:17:50.006 --> 00:17:51.266 A:middle
And at the other extreme,

00:17:51.386 --> 00:17:53.296 A:middle
we have continuous
location sessions,

00:17:53.686 --> 00:17:56.376 A:middle
which can drain the user's
battery in just a few hours.

00:17:59.776 --> 00:18:01.806 A:middle
No matter how cool your app is,

00:17:59.776 --> 00:18:01.806 A:middle
No matter how cool your app is,

00:18:02.076 --> 00:18:05.276 A:middle
if it drains the user's battery
faster than they would expect,

00:18:05.506 --> 00:18:07.726 A:middle
they're not going
to enjoy using it.

00:18:09.356 --> 00:18:12.866 A:middle
Thus, you must design your
app with power in mind.

00:18:13.456 --> 00:18:17.316 A:middle
Sometimes that means sacrificing
accuracy or latency in order

00:18:17.316 --> 00:18:20.476 A:middle
to achieve the power metrics
that your users would expect.

00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:25.846 A:middle
To achieve that, you
must use the right API.

00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:30.556 A:middle
But Core Location
has a lot of APIs.

00:18:30.556 --> 00:18:32.546 A:middle
How do you know which
one is the right one?

00:18:33.596 --> 00:18:35.286 A:middle
I put together a
simple decision tree

00:18:35.286 --> 00:18:37.786 A:middle
that should help guide
you toward the right API.

00:18:38.446 --> 00:18:40.376 A:middle
It's not meant to
capture every possibility,

00:18:40.496 --> 00:18:42.016 A:middle
but it should be enough
to get you started.

00:18:43.476 --> 00:18:46.496 A:middle
The first question to consider
is whether you want the user's

00:18:46.496 --> 00:18:49.016 A:middle
location now, or
sometime in the future.

00:18:50.016 --> 00:18:53.796 A:middle
If you're interested in the
future, then you want to use one

00:18:53.796 --> 00:18:55.496 A:middle
of our background
monitoring APIs.

00:18:55.796 --> 00:18:57.916 A:middle
Either region monitoring,
if you're interested

00:18:57.916 --> 00:19:01.636 A:middle
in a specific location, or visit
monitoring if you're interested

00:18:57.916 --> 00:19:01.636 A:middle
in a specific location, or visit
monitoring if you're interested

00:19:01.636 --> 00:19:05.186 A:middle
in any location that
the user stops at.

00:19:08.456 --> 00:19:10.786 A:middle
If you want to know about
the present, then you want

00:19:10.786 --> 00:19:12.496 A:middle
to use our standard
location service.

00:19:13.076 --> 00:19:15.546 A:middle
Now, there's a lot of
different ways you can use it.

00:19:15.546 --> 00:19:17.496 A:middle
So let's drill into
some specifics.

00:19:18.326 --> 00:19:20.616 A:middle
If you're writing a
fitness application,

00:19:21.056 --> 00:19:23.576 A:middle
then we recommend you use
deferred location updates

00:19:23.626 --> 00:19:25.216 A:middle
in a continuous location
session.

00:19:26.956 --> 00:19:29.086 A:middle
If you're writing a
navigation application,

00:19:29.596 --> 00:19:32.866 A:middle
then you probably want to use
a continuous location session.

00:19:33.376 --> 00:19:38.606 A:middle
If your app is continuously
updating UI,

00:19:38.836 --> 00:19:40.306 A:middle
then you also probably want

00:19:40.306 --> 00:19:42.546 A:middle
to use a continuous
location session.

00:19:42.996 --> 00:19:47.776 A:middle
The final question to consider
is whether your app is recording

00:19:47.776 --> 00:19:49.406 A:middle
a track of the user's location.

00:19:50.186 --> 00:19:53.046 A:middle
If it is, then we would
recommend you use deferred

00:19:53.046 --> 00:19:53.986 A:middle
location updates.

00:19:54.926 --> 00:19:56.406 A:middle
In most other situations,

00:19:56.406 --> 00:19:58.626 A:middle
we would recommend using
the single location API.

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:01.876 A:middle
You may have noticed
the battery icon

00:20:01.876 --> 00:20:02.856 A:middle
at the bottom of this slide.

00:20:02.856 --> 00:20:05.936 A:middle
These aren't meant to be taken
literally, they're just a guide

00:20:06.346 --> 00:20:09.276 A:middle
to give you a rough idea of how
much power each service uses.

00:20:13.756 --> 00:20:15.546 A:middle
Okay, for authorization,

00:20:16.176 --> 00:20:19.006 A:middle
we highly recommend you use
when-in-use authorization

00:20:19.006 --> 00:20:19.856 A:middle
whenever possible.

00:20:21.466 --> 00:20:24.016 A:middle
Users like knowing that
you can't track them

00:20:24.016 --> 00:20:25.096 A:middle
without their knowledge.

00:20:27.196 --> 00:20:30.036 A:middle
Furthermore, you should
communicate with your users

00:20:30.076 --> 00:20:32.526 A:middle
and make sure they
understand why you're asking

00:20:32.526 --> 00:20:34.196 A:middle
for the authorization
level you are,

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:37.446 A:middle
and how you intend
to make use of it.

00:20:38.866 --> 00:20:40.906 A:middle
Remember, Core Location
displays a prompt

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:43.346 A:middle
that includes a usage
description key provided

00:20:43.346 --> 00:20:43.986 A:middle
by your app.

00:20:44.556 --> 00:20:47.336 A:middle
This is an excellent opportunity
to communicate with the user,

00:20:47.556 --> 00:20:53.826 A:middle
but hopefully it's not the
last opportunity you'll take.

00:20:54.036 --> 00:20:56.886 A:middle
Your app should be prepared
to direct users to settings.

00:20:57.446 --> 00:20:59.596 A:middle
Core Location only
displays a limited number

00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:02.966 A:middle
of authorization prompts for
your app, and so at some point,

00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:02.966 A:middle
of authorization prompts for
your app, and so at some point,

00:21:03.296 --> 00:21:06.086 A:middle
if you want your authorization
level changed, users will have

00:21:06.086 --> 00:21:07.836 A:middle
to go to settings
and do it themself.

00:21:09.036 --> 00:21:11.176 A:middle
If you direct your
UI application

00:21:11.286 --> 00:21:15.396 A:middle
to open the UI application, open
settings, URL string constant,

00:21:16.696 --> 00:21:19.696 A:middle
then iOS will display
your apps settings pane.

00:21:20.776 --> 00:21:23.366 A:middle
For Potluck, our sample app,
it looks something like this.

00:21:24.146 --> 00:21:26.916 A:middle
As you can see, the user
is just a few taps away

00:21:26.916 --> 00:21:29.016 A:middle
from changing Potluck's
authorization.

00:21:34.116 --> 00:21:37.396 A:middle
We've seen a lot of developers
get confused by Core Location

00:21:37.396 --> 00:21:38.886 A:middle
and it's threading requirements.

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:43.886 A:middle
The first thing to remember is
that Core Location requires you

00:21:43.886 --> 00:21:48.406 A:middle
to create your CLLocationManager
on a thread that has a runloop.

00:21:49.676 --> 00:21:52.826 A:middle
When the location manager is
initialized, it will determine

00:21:52.826 --> 00:21:55.396 A:middle
which run loop is associated
with the current thread.

00:21:56.236 --> 00:21:58.876 A:middle
It will then deliver
all delegate callbacks

00:21:59.016 --> 00:21:59.816 A:middle
on that runloop.

00:22:02.136 --> 00:22:03.846 A:middle
Now, for many applications,

00:22:04.586 --> 00:22:07.106 A:middle
the main thread is the
only thread with a runloop.

00:22:08.496 --> 00:22:11.686 A:middle
As such, it is safe to
create your location manager

00:22:11.686 --> 00:22:14.736 A:middle
on the main thread, but
if you do, be careful.

00:22:15.516 --> 00:22:17.376 A:middle
You have to keep your
main thread active

00:22:17.376 --> 00:22:19.106 A:middle
in order to handle UI events.

00:22:20.096 --> 00:22:23.306 A:middle
If you spend a lot of time
processing location information,

00:22:23.656 --> 00:22:25.336 A:middle
then your app will
become unresponsive.

00:22:29.216 --> 00:22:32.536 A:middle
We recommend that you always
interact with location manager,

00:22:32.566 --> 00:22:34.966 A:middle
that is, call its
methods from the thread

00:22:34.966 --> 00:22:36.006 A:middle
that it was created on.

00:22:37.126 --> 00:22:39.166 A:middle
We believe this simplifies
interactions

00:22:39.166 --> 00:22:40.306 A:middle
with location manager.

00:22:40.826 --> 00:22:44.876 A:middle
Let's look at some code.

00:22:45.646 --> 00:22:47.486 A:middle
Here I am requesting
authorization.

00:22:48.086 --> 00:22:52.076 A:middle
Let's suppose I've already added
the necessary usage description

00:22:52.076 --> 00:22:54.116 A:middle
keys to my information
property list.

00:22:55.086 --> 00:22:56.836 A:middle
Here, I'm creating
a location manager,

00:22:56.836 --> 00:22:59.076 A:middle
and I'm calling request
when-in-use authorization.

00:22:59.756 --> 00:23:01.656 A:middle
Unfortunately, this won't work.

00:22:59.756 --> 00:23:01.656 A:middle
Unfortunately, this won't work.

00:23:02.626 --> 00:23:03.006 A:middle
See,

00:23:03.006 --> 00:23:05.816 A:middle
the requesWhenInUseAuthorization
method is asynchronous,

00:23:06.276 --> 00:23:09.876 A:middle
and CLLocationManager when it is
deallocated will automatically

00:23:09.916 --> 00:23:12.496 A:middle
tear down any outstanding
authorization prompts,

00:23:13.406 --> 00:23:16.366 A:middle
and so the user probably won't
see the authorization prompt

00:23:16.366 --> 00:23:18.706 A:middle
at all, since the manager
will be deallocated

00:23:18.706 --> 00:23:22.906 A:middle
at the end of the function.

00:23:23.056 --> 00:23:24.336 A:middle
Let's try something
a little different.

00:23:25.306 --> 00:23:27.816 A:middle
If we put it into a
static class property,

00:23:28.096 --> 00:23:29.776 A:middle
then it will certainly
live long enough.

00:23:30.626 --> 00:23:33.566 A:middle
However, this introduces
a new bug.

00:23:34.556 --> 00:23:37.936 A:middle
See, Swift will initialize the
manager property the first time

00:23:37.936 --> 00:23:38.666 A:middle
it's accessed.

00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:43.266 A:middle
And unless we're very careful
and ensure we always access it

00:23:43.266 --> 00:23:44.406 A:middle
from a thread with a runloop,

00:23:45.016 --> 00:23:47.516 A:middle
this could create
a location manager

00:23:47.516 --> 00:23:48.996 A:middle
on a thread without a runloop.

00:23:49.806 --> 00:23:52.806 A:middle
We believe this pattern is error
prone and discourage its use.

00:23:55.336 --> 00:23:56.306 A:middle
One more try.

00:23:57.176 --> 00:23:59.216 A:middle
Here, we are creating
our location manager

00:23:59.466 --> 00:24:03.066 A:middle
as an instance property
on a ViewController.

00:23:59.466 --> 00:24:03.066 A:middle
as an instance property
on a ViewController.

00:24:04.826 --> 00:24:08.286 A:middle
Now, view controllers are always
constructed on the main thread,

00:24:08.796 --> 00:24:09.676 A:middle
and in this instance,

00:24:09.676 --> 00:24:11.666 A:middle
the location manager
will be created along

00:24:11.666 --> 00:24:12.706 A:middle
with the ViewController.

00:24:13.626 --> 00:24:16.496 A:middle
So we are guaranteed that
the location manger will be

00:24:16.496 --> 00:24:18.256 A:middle
constructed on the main thread.

00:24:19.936 --> 00:24:23.196 A:middle
This is the recommended pattern
for creating location managers.

00:24:23.736 --> 00:24:25.156 A:middle
You might also consider
attaching it

00:24:25.186 --> 00:24:26.576 A:middle
to your app delegate instead.

00:24:26.576 --> 00:24:35.566 A:middle
Now since the standard location
service can be the most power

00:24:35.566 --> 00:24:37.766 A:middle
hungry of all of
Core Location's APIs,

00:24:37.996 --> 00:24:39.616 A:middle
it's important to
use it correctly.

00:24:40.956 --> 00:24:44.626 A:middle
First we recommend using
the request location API

00:24:45.126 --> 00:24:46.066 A:middle
whenever possible.

00:24:48.056 --> 00:24:49.886 A:middle
Second, you should ensure

00:24:49.886 --> 00:24:52.166 A:middle
that your desired
accuracy property is set

00:24:52.166 --> 00:24:54.636 A:middle
to the largest value
your app can tolerate.

00:24:56.096 --> 00:24:59.786 A:middle
Generally, more accurate
locations require more power

00:24:59.786 --> 00:25:00.366 A:middle
to create.

00:24:59.786 --> 00:25:00.366 A:middle
to create.

00:25:01.096 --> 00:25:05.826 A:middle
As an example, if you request,
say, 100 meter accuracy,

00:25:06.146 --> 00:25:09.566 A:middle
Core Location usually doesn't
need to turn on the GPS in order

00:25:09.566 --> 00:25:11.666 A:middle
to satisfy your location
request.

00:25:12.796 --> 00:25:16.136 A:middle
Keep in mind that Core
Location will give you

00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:18.686 A:middle
or could give you a location
update that is more accurate

00:25:18.686 --> 00:25:19.636 A:middle
than what you requested.

00:25:20.156 --> 00:25:25.116 A:middle
So to say you request a 3
kilometer accuracy location.

00:25:25.646 --> 00:25:27.976 A:middle
This will effectively
ask Core Location

00:25:27.976 --> 00:25:30.626 A:middle
to give you whatever location
is most readily available.

00:25:34.096 --> 00:25:37.826 A:middle
We encourage you to keep
automatic pausing enabled.

00:25:38.556 --> 00:25:40.506 A:middle
We've tuned the automatic
pausing algorithm

00:25:40.506 --> 00:25:41.786 A:middle
to be fairly conservative.

00:25:42.426 --> 00:25:46.136 A:middle
We would be surprised if it
stopped your location session

00:25:46.136 --> 00:25:49.516 A:middle
at a time when the user was
still gaining benefit from it.

00:25:49.516 --> 00:25:52.266 A:middle
As long as you've configured it
correctly, you should be able

00:25:52.266 --> 00:25:53.776 A:middle
to leave it running
all the time.

00:25:54.816 --> 00:25:56.786 A:middle
To configure automatic pausing,

00:25:57.026 --> 00:25:59.686 A:middle
simply set the activity
type property

00:25:59.996 --> 00:26:02.406 A:middle
on your location manager
to the appropriate value.

00:25:59.996 --> 00:26:02.406 A:middle
on your location manager
to the appropriate value.

00:26:03.056 --> 00:26:04.166 A:middle
If you'd like to learn more,

00:26:04.166 --> 00:26:05.796 A:middle
you should consult
our documentation.

00:26:08.506 --> 00:26:10.966 A:middle
Similarly, we recommend leaving

00:26:11.136 --> 00:26:14.006 A:middle
or enabling deferred
location updates.

00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:17.336 A:middle
Deferred location updates allows
Core Location to put the device

00:26:17.336 --> 00:26:18.786 A:middle
into a low power state

00:26:18.866 --> 00:26:21.596 A:middle
and collect location
information passively

00:26:21.636 --> 00:26:23.496 A:middle
and then process it
in large batches.

00:26:27.546 --> 00:26:30.816 A:middle
This can result in a fairly
large power savings compared

00:26:30.816 --> 00:26:33.046 A:middle
to a normal continuous
location session.

00:26:38.236 --> 00:26:40.006 A:middle
If this is all a
little confusing,

00:26:40.006 --> 00:26:41.816 A:middle
and you're not entirely
sure how each

00:26:41.816 --> 00:26:43.996 A:middle
of these settings plays
out, you might want

00:26:43.996 --> 00:26:46.866 A:middle
to consider using the energy
log instrument in Xcode.

00:26:47.496 --> 00:26:48.656 A:middle
This will give you a rough idea

00:26:48.656 --> 00:26:50.916 A:middle
of how much power your
continuous location sessions

00:26:50.916 --> 00:26:51.516 A:middle
are drawing.

00:26:54.496 --> 00:26:57.306 A:middle
Finally, we recommend
that you set the

00:26:57.306 --> 00:27:01.016 A:middle
allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates
property to true only

00:26:57.306 --> 00:27:01.016 A:middle
allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates
property to true only

00:27:01.016 --> 00:27:02.486 A:middle
when you're sure that you want

00:27:02.486 --> 00:27:04.206 A:middle
to begin a background
location session.

00:27:05.116 --> 00:27:07.856 A:middle
We've seen some apps set
it to true unconditionally

00:27:07.856 --> 00:27:09.856 A:middle
and then just stop
their location sessions

00:27:09.856 --> 00:27:10.856 A:middle
when they enter the background,

00:27:11.276 --> 00:27:12.736 A:middle
but this has a negative
side effect.

00:27:13.886 --> 00:27:18.036 A:middle
Here, I've modified Potluck, our
sample app, to do exactly that.

00:27:19.066 --> 00:27:21.836 A:middle
You'll see that when I start
the session and then home out,

00:27:22.576 --> 00:27:24.146 A:middle
there is a blue bar at
the top of the screen

00:27:24.146 --> 00:27:25.256 A:middle
for just a few seconds.

00:27:25.846 --> 00:27:27.436 A:middle
So here I am starting
the session.

00:27:27.956 --> 00:27:30.286 A:middle
Then I hit the home button,
and there is a blue bar

00:27:30.286 --> 00:27:31.106 A:middle
at the top of the screen.

00:27:31.946 --> 00:27:33.686 A:middle
This can be easily avoided

00:27:33.686 --> 00:27:36.346 A:middle
by simply managing your
allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates

00:27:36.346 --> 00:27:37.586 A:middle
property properly.

00:27:44.076 --> 00:27:47.846 A:middle
Now, our monitoring APIs
affect your entire process.

00:27:48.486 --> 00:27:51.316 A:middle
As such, we recommend that
you always interact with them

00:27:51.646 --> 00:27:55.296 A:middle
from a single location manager,
shared by your entire process.

00:27:56.406 --> 00:28:01.326 A:middle
You might want to attach
it to your app delegate.

00:27:56.406 --> 00:28:01.326 A:middle
You might want to attach
it to your app delegate.

00:28:01.326 --> 00:28:04.146 A:middle
Furthermore, our
monitoring APIs will continue

00:28:04.286 --> 00:28:05.796 A:middle
until you tell it to stop.

00:28:07.616 --> 00:28:10.286 A:middle
This is true, even if
you update your app

00:28:10.456 --> 00:28:12.826 A:middle
and remove all references
to Core Location

00:28:12.826 --> 00:28:14.376 A:middle
and stop linking the framework.

00:28:15.916 --> 00:28:19.476 A:middle
So we highly recommend that
whenever your app is launched,

00:28:19.706 --> 00:28:23.416 A:middle
you take a moment and assess
whether you think Core Location

00:28:23.446 --> 00:28:26.936 A:middle
should be doing background
monitoring for your app.

00:28:27.286 --> 00:28:28.566 A:middle
Unless you're sure that at

00:28:28.596 --> 00:28:30.756 A:middle
that time background
monitoring should be running,

00:28:31.256 --> 00:28:33.856 A:middle
you should tell Core
Location to stop monitoring.

00:28:35.956 --> 00:28:39.556 A:middle
This small snippet of code is
all it takes to stop all three

00:28:39.556 --> 00:28:40.976 A:middle
of our background
monitoring APIs.

00:28:48.516 --> 00:28:50.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; If you're writing an
app for an indoor venue,

00:28:52.126 --> 00:28:55.466 A:middle
you should remember that Core
Location will automatically

00:28:55.466 --> 00:28:58.856 A:middle
enable indoor location
technologies whenever your app--

00:28:59.086 --> 00:29:02.236 A:middle
sorry, whenever the user--
is inside your venue.

00:28:59.086 --> 00:29:02.236 A:middle
sorry, whenever the user--
is inside your venue.

00:29:03.706 --> 00:29:06.126 A:middle
This only happens if your
venue has been surveyed.

00:29:06.666 --> 00:29:08.646 A:middle
If you'd like your
venue to get surveyed,

00:29:08.906 --> 00:29:11.866 A:middle
go to mapsconnect.apple.com
to learn more.

00:29:15.176 --> 00:29:18.626 A:middle
Beacon region monitoring is
a highly versatile technology

00:29:18.626 --> 00:29:21.606 A:middle
that can be used in all
sorts of problem domains,

00:29:22.006 --> 00:29:25.696 A:middle
but we think it pairs especially
well with indoor scenarios.

00:29:26.216 --> 00:29:28.486 A:middle
It complements indoor
location very well.

00:29:29.726 --> 00:29:33.086 A:middle
Beacon region monitoring allows
your app to detect proximity

00:29:33.306 --> 00:29:35.956 A:middle
to landmarks that you've
established inside the venue.

00:29:37.496 --> 00:29:40.946 A:middle
Indoor location allows you to
display the user's location

00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:44.376 A:middle
on a map, and help them navigate
from one location to another.

00:29:49.496 --> 00:29:52.506 A:middle
On watchOS, you should remember

00:29:52.766 --> 00:29:56.276 A:middle
that Core Location will
automatically leverage the

00:29:56.276 --> 00:29:57.596 A:middle
iPhone if it's nearby.

00:29:58.476 --> 00:30:00.306 A:middle
Let us handle talking
to the iPhone

00:29:58.476 --> 00:30:00.306 A:middle
Let us handle talking
to the iPhone

00:30:00.306 --> 00:30:02.476 A:middle
and using it to compute
locations.

00:30:04.376 --> 00:30:06.396 A:middle
Furthermore, we've seen a lot

00:30:06.396 --> 00:30:09.426 A:middle
of apps request always
authorization on watchOS,

00:30:09.536 --> 00:30:11.896 A:middle
even though what they are
doing could be accomplished

00:30:11.896 --> 00:30:13.346 A:middle
with when-in-use authorization.

00:30:14.756 --> 00:30:19.776 A:middle
If you're thinking of using
always authorization on watchOS,

00:30:20.296 --> 00:30:22.016 A:middle
we would encourage you
to take a second look

00:30:22.016 --> 00:30:23.386 A:middle
at when-in-use authorization.

00:30:26.676 --> 00:30:30.706 A:middle
For watchOS 3, we are making
startUpdatingLocation available

00:30:30.706 --> 00:30:31.526 A:middle
on watchOS.

00:30:32.676 --> 00:30:35.466 A:middle
However, most apps would still
probably be better served

00:30:35.466 --> 00:30:36.736 A:middle
by requestLocation.

00:30:37.666 --> 00:30:39.096 A:middle
There is an exception, though.

00:30:40.296 --> 00:30:42.646 A:middle
In watchOS 3, we've
made background

00:30:42.646 --> 00:30:44.966 A:middle
on watch possible
for fitness purposes.

00:30:45.696 --> 00:30:47.916 A:middle
So if you're looking at
creating a workout application,

00:30:48.306 --> 00:30:48.776 A:middle
we believe

00:30:48.776 --> 00:30:56.766 A:middle
that startUpdatingLocation is
the perfect API or you to use.

00:30:56.946 --> 00:31:02.066 A:middle
For macOS, we only support
always authorization.

00:30:56.946 --> 00:31:02.066 A:middle
For macOS, we only support
always authorization.

00:31:04.456 --> 00:31:08.336 A:middle
Furthermore, Core Location will
automatically display a prompt

00:31:08.336 --> 00:31:10.476 A:middle
when you attempt to access
location information.

00:31:11.176 --> 00:31:13.466 A:middle
You don't need to call
requestAlwaysAuthorization

00:31:13.466 --> 00:31:14.406 A:middle
on macOS.

00:31:17.596 --> 00:31:20.346 A:middle
Since Macs don't tend to
move around very much,

00:31:21.596 --> 00:31:25.036 A:middle
we believe that requestLocation
is usually the API you want

00:31:25.036 --> 00:31:27.116 A:middle
to use on macOS.

00:31:30.376 --> 00:31:34.196 A:middle
For tvOS, you have got
three powerful APIs,

00:31:34.686 --> 00:31:37.956 A:middle
Single Location,
Geocoding and MapKit.

00:31:38.906 --> 00:31:41.296 A:middle
Using these APIs, you've
got everything you need

00:31:41.296 --> 00:31:44.396 A:middle
to create a great location
aware experience on Apple TV.

00:31:45.566 --> 00:31:48.856 A:middle
But be extra careful with
any information vended

00:31:48.856 --> 00:31:50.566 A:middle
to your application
through Core Location;

00:31:51.896 --> 00:31:54.866 A:middle
tvOS devices usually
live in a user's home,

00:31:55.596 --> 00:31:59.196 A:middle
and the user's home is among the
most sensitive information you

00:31:59.196 --> 00:32:00.376 A:middle
can get from Core Location.

00:31:59.196 --> 00:32:00.376 A:middle
can get from Core Location.

00:32:01.566 --> 00:32:02.836 A:middle
You should treat
that information

00:32:02.836 --> 00:32:04.156 A:middle
with the respect it deserves.

00:32:08.496 --> 00:32:11.596 A:middle
That brings us to the
end of our session today.

00:32:11.856 --> 00:32:15.366 A:middle
There are four things I want
you to remember as you leave.

00:32:16.116 --> 00:32:19.576 A:middle
First, you must respect
the user's privacy.

00:32:21.336 --> 00:32:23.716 A:middle
Part of this is communicating
with the user

00:32:23.716 --> 00:32:26.416 A:middle
and making sure they understand
what you're asking for

00:32:26.626 --> 00:32:30.226 A:middle
and how you intend to use it.

00:32:30.446 --> 00:32:33.996 A:middle
Second, conserving power
is an essential part

00:32:34.406 --> 00:32:35.786 A:middle
of using Core Location.

00:32:36.786 --> 00:32:40.846 A:middle
Sometimes you have to sacrifice
accuracy and latency in order

00:32:40.846 --> 00:32:44.196 A:middle
to create the experience
your users would expect,

00:32:44.776 --> 00:32:47.946 A:middle
while still having the power
metrics your users would expect.

00:32:49.606 --> 00:32:53.596 A:middle
To do that, you have to make
sure you use the correct Core

00:32:53.596 --> 00:32:56.076 A:middle
Location API for
your problem domain.

00:32:57.536 --> 00:33:00.796 A:middle
Similarly, make sure you use
when-in-use authorization

00:32:57.536 --> 00:33:00.796 A:middle
Similarly, make sure you use
when-in-use authorization

00:33:01.016 --> 00:33:02.086 A:middle
whenever you can.

00:33:02.636 --> 00:33:06.526 A:middle
If you're having a hard
time getting started

00:33:06.526 --> 00:33:09.566 A:middle
with Core Location, I
recommend you take a look

00:33:09.566 --> 00:33:10.836 A:middle
at Potluck, our sample app.

00:33:11.536 --> 00:33:13.436 A:middle
We updated it this
year for Swift 3,

00:33:13.896 --> 00:33:15.056 A:middle
so it's looking better
than ever.

00:33:16.856 --> 00:33:19.656 A:middle
If you'd like to learn more
you can view our supplementary

00:33:19.656 --> 00:33:26.446 A:middle
material online or check out
one of these related sessions.

00:33:29.296 --> 00:33:30.966 A:middle
With that, thank
you for your time.

00:33:31.036 --> 00:33:31.936 A:middle
Enjoy the rest of WWDC.

00:33:32.516 --> 00:33:35.500 A:middle
