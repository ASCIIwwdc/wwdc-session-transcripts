00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:31.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi everybody.

00:00:31.826 --> 00:00:33.136 A:middle
Welcome to our session

00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:35.546 A:middle
on Expanded Subscriptions
in iTunes Connect.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.836 A:middle
My name is Daniel Miao and
I'm the engineering manager

00:00:38.836 --> 00:00:39.706 A:middle
on iTunes Connect.

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.146 A:middle
So, we're going to
start this session off

00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:45.326 A:middle
by doing a quick review of
in-app purchases in general.

00:00:45.326 --> 00:00:47.846 A:middle
And then we're going to
move into the details

00:00:47.846 --> 00:00:50.546 A:middle
of how we're enhancing auto
renewable subscriptions

00:00:50.586 --> 00:00:54.356 A:middle
specifically in iTunes
Connect and in the system.

00:00:55.336 --> 00:00:57.876 A:middle
So, we've received a
lot of feedback from you

00:00:58.106 --> 00:01:00.766 A:middle
around how we can
improve auto-renewables

00:00:58.106 --> 00:01:00.766 A:middle
around how we can
improve auto-renewables

00:01:00.886 --> 00:01:02.156 A:middle
to better fit your businesses.

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:06.016 A:middle
So, we're very excited because
today we get to take you

00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:09.136 A:middle
through new features that
will give you better control

00:01:09.186 --> 00:01:10.156 A:middle
over your pricing.

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.026 A:middle
Help you to retain
your loyal customers.

00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:16.946 A:middle
And give you and your
customers more flexible tools

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:18.256 A:middle
for managing your subscriptions.

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.876 A:middle
So, let's start with
the most basic question.

00:01:23.156 --> 00:01:24.776 A:middle
What is an in-app purchase.

00:01:25.806 --> 00:01:29.266 A:middle
Well, an in-app purchase
is simply digital content

00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:32.606 A:middle
or service that your customer
buys from within your app.

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:37.366 A:middle
Now contrast with your customer
downloading your app off the app

00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:40.996 A:middle
store and receiving all
of that content up front.

00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:45.476 A:middle
Now, there are many ways
to use in-app purchases.

00:01:45.696 --> 00:01:48.486 A:middle
But, generally in-app
purchases are great if you want

00:01:48.486 --> 00:01:50.386 A:middle
to give your customers
the opportunity

00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:54.346 A:middle
to get an understanding of your
app offering before purchasing

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:55.916 A:middle
add-ons to that offering.

00:01:57.346 --> 00:02:00.766 A:middle
Also, if you have a
subscription model for your app,

00:01:57.346 --> 00:02:00.766 A:middle
Also, if you have a
subscription model for your app,

00:02:01.176 --> 00:02:02.906 A:middle
in-app purchases are
also a great fit.

00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:08.406 A:middle
And there are a number of in-app
purchase types available to you.

00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:11.636 A:middle
We have consumables,
non-consumables,

00:02:12.296 --> 00:02:15.766 A:middle
non-renewable subscriptions, and
auto-renewable subscriptions.

00:02:16.856 --> 00:02:19.036 A:middle
Today we also have
free subscriptions.

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:22.346 A:middle
But, free subscriptions will
be deprecated this fall.

00:02:23.096 --> 00:02:25.556 A:middle
So, for those of you who have
free subscriptions today,

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:27.556 A:middle
you can continue using them.

00:02:27.986 --> 00:02:30.266 A:middle
But, you will not be
able to create new ones.

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:34.146 A:middle
So, let's go through
each of these types.

00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:36.726 A:middle
First, we have consumables.

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:38.736 A:middle
Consumable is an in-app purchase

00:02:38.736 --> 00:02:41.316 A:middle
that your customers
purchase once per use.

00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:44.546 A:middle
Here we have an example
of a simulation game

00:02:44.546 --> 00:02:45.976 A:middle
on the app store,
Fallout Shelter.

00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:47.216 A:middle
It's a great game.

00:02:47.216 --> 00:02:51.216 A:middle
And the way Fallout
Shelter uses consumables is

00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:54.396 A:middle
to give you the opportunity
to buy in game items.

00:02:55.336 --> 00:02:57.666 A:middle
You use real money
to buy in game items.

00:02:58.226 --> 00:02:59.366 A:middle
Add them to your inventory.

00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:02.156 A:middle
And once you've used them
up you go back into the game

00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:02.156 A:middle
And once you've used them
up you go back into the game

00:03:02.506 --> 00:03:03.876 A:middle
and you purchase more.

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:09.256 A:middle
Next we have non-consumables.

00:03:09.876 --> 00:03:12.006 A:middle
The non-consumables
is in-app purchase

00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:15.096 A:middle
that your customer buys
once and uses indefinitely.

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:18.256 A:middle
In this example we
have Weirdwood Manor.

00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:20.746 A:middle
This is an interactive
storybook app.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.926 A:middle
When you purchase this
app you get the first book

00:03:23.926 --> 00:03:26.746 A:middle
in the series with the download.

00:03:27.426 --> 00:03:31.206 A:middle
If you enjoy this book you're
able to buy additional books

00:03:31.206 --> 00:03:35.936 A:middle
from inside of the app either
individually or as a collection.

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:39.146 A:middle
Once you've unlocked these
books they're yours for good.

00:03:39.476 --> 00:03:44.596 A:middle
Next we have non-renewable
subscriptions.

00:03:45.216 --> 00:03:48.506 A:middle
A non-renewable subscription
is one that is purchased once

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:51.916 A:middle
and available for
a limited time.

00:03:52.496 --> 00:03:56.206 A:middle
In this case we have Quizlet,
which is a study tools app.

00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:59.286 A:middle
And this app comes with many
great features out of the box.

00:03:59.776 --> 00:04:04.386 A:middle
But, if you'd like more features
Quizlet also offers a Quizlet

00:03:59.776 --> 00:04:04.386 A:middle
But, if you'd like more features
Quizlet also offers a Quizlet

00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:05.376 A:middle
Plus service.

00:04:06.136 --> 00:04:11.126 A:middle
You subscribe to Quizlet Plus
for one year by paying $14.99.

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:12.566 A:middle
And after that year if you'd

00:04:12.566 --> 00:04:15.736 A:middle
like to continue using the
Plus services you'd pay

00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:16.935 A:middle
for an additional year.

00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:21.805 A:middle
And finally we have
auto-renewable subscriptions.

00:04:22.706 --> 00:04:25.206 A:middle
And auto-renewable is
exactly the way it sounds.

00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:27.156 A:middle
It's a subscription
that you purchase

00:04:28.026 --> 00:04:31.956 A:middle
and it's renewed automatically
at regular intervals.

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:36.006 A:middle
Here we have HBO Now, which
is a video streaming app.

00:04:37.596 --> 00:04:39.746 A:middle
HBO Now offers a subscription,

00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:43.676 A:middle
a monthly subscription
for $14.99 a month.

00:04:43.676 --> 00:04:45.686 A:middle
So, you purchase this
subscription initially

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:49.526 A:middle
for $14.99 and each month
it automatically renews,

00:04:49.846 --> 00:04:51.876 A:middle
and you're charged $14.99.

00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:54.706 A:middle
And if at some point you want
to stop your subscription,

00:04:55.366 --> 00:04:56.946 A:middle
you go into you manuals
subscriptions page

00:04:56.946 --> 00:04:59.976 A:middle
in your account settings and
you turn off the renewal option.

00:05:00.986 --> 00:05:02.806 A:middle
Okay. So, it says here a few

00:05:02.806 --> 00:05:05.206 A:middle
of the different types
of in-app purchases.

00:05:05.956 --> 00:05:08.416 A:middle
Now, let's move into
talking about the changes

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:10.606 A:middle
that are coming specifically
to auto-renewables.

00:05:11.526 --> 00:05:13.906 A:middle
Let's start by talking
about proceeds.

00:05:15.116 --> 00:05:17.736 A:middle
So, those of you who have
auto-renewables today are aware

00:05:17.736 --> 00:05:22.326 A:middle
that up until last week you
were receiving 70% proceeds

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:24.376 A:middle
for any new subscriptions

00:05:24.436 --> 00:05:27.166 A:middle
to your auto-renewables
or renewals.

00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:30.556 A:middle
This is the same for
apps and the same

00:05:30.556 --> 00:05:32.976 A:middle
for other in-app purchase types.

00:05:33.206 --> 00:05:38.596 A:middle
But, beginning this week,
you'll be receiving 85% proceeds

00:05:38.946 --> 00:05:42.696 A:middle
from any customers that haven't
subscribed for one year or more.

00:05:43.516 --> 00:05:48.966 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:51.286 A:middle
The best part about
this is you don't have

00:05:51.286 --> 00:05:53.866 A:middle
to wait a whole year
before you see the 85%.

00:05:54.486 --> 00:05:56.516 A:middle
For those of you who
have existing customers,

00:05:57.406 --> 00:06:00.986 A:middle
you'll start receiving
85% proceeds on renewals

00:05:57.406 --> 00:06:00.986 A:middle
you'll start receiving
85% proceeds on renewals

00:06:01.446 --> 00:06:04.076 A:middle
for any customers that have been
already subscribed to your app

00:06:04.076 --> 00:06:08.006 A:middle
for a year or more beginning
with renewals this week.

00:06:10.516 --> 00:06:14.686 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:06:15.186 --> 00:06:15.426 A:middle
All right.

00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:16.996 A:middle
Next let's talk about
app categories.

00:06:18.636 --> 00:06:21.486 A:middle
Today if you want to create an
auto-renewable subscription your

00:06:21.486 --> 00:06:24.676 A:middle
app has to belong inside a
set of limited categories.

00:06:26.276 --> 00:06:29.386 A:middle
Well, we've seen a lot of
successful businesses grow

00:06:29.386 --> 00:06:31.676 A:middle
around auto-renewables
over the past few years.

00:06:32.436 --> 00:06:35.216 A:middle
And we've seen these businesses
deliver excellent products

00:06:35.216 --> 00:06:37.336 A:middle
to customers that the
customers really love.

00:06:38.726 --> 00:06:41.906 A:middle
Additionally many of you have
been coming to us asking to open

00:06:41.906 --> 00:06:44.286 A:middle
up auto-renewables to
your app categories.

00:06:45.886 --> 00:06:49.986 A:middle
So, we're very happy
because beginning this fall

00:06:50.746 --> 00:06:53.696 A:middle
if your app makes sense
for auto-renewables,

00:06:54.266 --> 00:06:57.366 A:middle
categories will no
longer be a limitation.

00:06:59.516 --> 00:07:02.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:06:59.516 --> 00:07:02.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:04.496 A:middle
So, those are some
of the policy changes

00:07:04.496 --> 00:07:07.016 A:middle
that are coming to
auto-renewables.

00:07:08.116 --> 00:07:09.916 A:middle
Now, let's talk about some
of the feature changes.

00:07:09.916 --> 00:07:12.936 A:middle
We'll start with how the
customer experience will

00:07:13.736 --> 00:07:14.766 A:middle
be evolving.

00:07:15.926 --> 00:07:18.096 A:middle
Here we have a subscription
management page

00:07:18.496 --> 00:07:21.106 A:middle
on your customer's device
that they see when they go

00:07:21.106 --> 00:07:24.826 A:middle
into the app store, go into
their account details and tap

00:07:24.876 --> 00:07:26.256 A:middle
into manage subscriptions.

00:07:26.966 --> 00:07:31.076 A:middle
These are all the subscriptions,
auto-renewable subscriptions

00:07:31.316 --> 00:07:32.716 A:middle
that your customer's
currently on.

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:37.866 A:middle
If we take a look at one of
these you'll notice a lot

00:07:37.866 --> 00:07:40.006 A:middle
of metadata here that you're
probably familiar with.

00:07:40.556 --> 00:07:42.306 A:middle
We have an app icon.

00:07:43.606 --> 00:07:44.526 A:middle
We have an app name.

00:07:44.526 --> 00:07:48.026 A:middle
And incidentally you can
override this app name

00:07:48.406 --> 00:07:50.626 A:middle
in iTunes Connect for
this specific view.

00:07:51.696 --> 00:07:52.936 A:middle
You might want to override this

00:07:52.936 --> 00:07:56.336 A:middle
if possibly your app name
is over 30 characters.

00:07:56.336 --> 00:07:58.806 A:middle
In which case it'll be truncated
in manage subscriptions,

00:07:59.506 --> 00:08:03.506 A:middle
or if your service name doesn't
quite match your app name.

00:07:59.506 --> 00:08:03.506 A:middle
or if your service name doesn't
quite match your app name.

00:08:05.136 --> 00:08:07.466 A:middle
Next we have the name of
the subscription group

00:08:08.026 --> 00:08:09.366 A:middle
that this subscription is in.

00:08:09.816 --> 00:08:13.486 A:middle
This will show up if you have
more than one group on your app.

00:08:14.816 --> 00:08:18.026 A:middle
And finally we have the name
of the subscription itself

00:08:18.626 --> 00:08:19.646 A:middle
as well as the duration.

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:23.256 A:middle
Now, if your customer
wants to manage one

00:08:23.256 --> 00:08:25.626 A:middle
of these subscription,
they simply tap into this

00:08:26.366 --> 00:08:27.826 A:middle
and they'll see this view.

00:08:29.226 --> 00:08:32.635 A:middle
Here we see the customer's
current subscription along

00:08:32.635 --> 00:08:35.326 A:middle
with renewal options
for the subscription.

00:08:35.996 --> 00:08:38.535 A:middle
These renewal options are
simply other subscriptions

00:08:38.655 --> 00:08:42.826 A:middle
in the same subscription group
as the customer's current one.

00:08:43.746 --> 00:08:47.036 A:middle
In a subscription group
it's just a collection

00:08:47.036 --> 00:08:51.196 A:middle
of subscriptions that
describe your app offering.

00:08:52.426 --> 00:08:55.906 A:middle
Now, as your customer moves

00:08:55.906 --> 00:08:59.436 A:middle
between subscriptions they
can only have one active

00:08:59.436 --> 00:09:01.126 A:middle
subscription per group.

00:08:59.436 --> 00:09:01.126 A:middle
subscription per group.

00:09:01.786 --> 00:09:03.296 A:middle
So, for example, if they went

00:09:03.296 --> 00:09:05.006 A:middle
from the full course
subscription here

00:09:05.006 --> 00:09:08.296 A:middle
to the entree only,
once entree only goes

00:09:08.296 --> 00:09:11.526 A:middle
into effect full
course will stop.

00:09:12.136 --> 00:09:16.606 A:middle
Next, if your customers
jump between subscriptions

00:09:16.606 --> 00:09:22.666 A:middle
in a group regularly, that will
not affect your 85% proceeds.

00:09:22.726 --> 00:09:24.746 A:middle
That means that as long
as the customer stays

00:09:24.746 --> 00:09:28.426 A:middle
within this group you'll
continue to accrue days towards

00:09:28.426 --> 00:09:31.606 A:middle
that year that you need
to start receiving 85%

00:09:31.956 --> 00:09:32.826 A:middle
from this customer.

00:09:33.376 --> 00:09:37.346 A:middle
As part of this feature
said, we're also going

00:09:37.346 --> 00:09:40.386 A:middle
to be adding the
ability to designate,

00:09:40.386 --> 00:09:41.876 A:middle
upgrade, and downgrade paths.

00:09:43.336 --> 00:09:46.456 A:middle
And upgraded goes into
effect immediately.

00:09:47.356 --> 00:09:49.486 A:middle
So, in this case if
we've designated as,

00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:53.216 A:middle
if we've designated entree only
to full course as an upgrade,

00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:58.006 A:middle
the switch to full course
would happen once the customer

00:09:58.006 --> 00:09:58.586 A:middle
selects it.

00:09:59.896 --> 00:10:03.336 A:middle
If the customer downgrades,
the new subscription goes

00:09:59.896 --> 00:10:03.336 A:middle
If the customer downgrades,
the new subscription goes

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:06.596 A:middle
into effect at the end of the
current subscription period.

00:10:07.346 --> 00:10:12.606 A:middle
Okay. So, we've talked a
little bit about groups.

00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:14.086 A:middle
Now, let's take a
look at the structure

00:10:14.086 --> 00:10:14.926 A:middle
of one of these groups.

00:10:15.216 --> 00:10:18.696 A:middle
For those of you who are
using auto-renewables today,

00:10:18.696 --> 00:10:20.896 A:middle
you make recognize the
term subscription family.

00:10:21.526 --> 00:10:23.696 A:middle
Beginning this fall
we'll just be referring

00:10:23.696 --> 00:10:25.296 A:middle
to families as groups.

00:10:26.896 --> 00:10:29.016 A:middle
Here we have an example
of subscription service

00:10:29.536 --> 00:10:31.246 A:middle
that has three subscriptions
in it.

00:10:31.566 --> 00:10:35.216 A:middle
A one week, a one month,
and a one year subscription.

00:10:36.786 --> 00:10:40.276 A:middle
Today we have a restriction
that says you cannot have more

00:10:40.276 --> 00:10:42.946 A:middle
than one of the same
duration in a group.

00:10:43.946 --> 00:10:46.606 A:middle
So, in this case that means you
wouldn't be able to have more

00:10:46.606 --> 00:10:49.606 A:middle
than one, one year
subscription for example.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.686 A:middle
But, we will be removing this
subscription in the fall,

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:54.736 A:middle
I mean this restriction
in the Fall.

00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:59.976 A:middle
So, that will allow you
to do something like this.

00:11:00.616 --> 00:11:02.866 A:middle
We call these subscription
levels.

00:11:03.606 --> 00:11:06.876 A:middle
Here you'll see an example that
has a silver level of service,

00:11:06.986 --> 00:11:09.076 A:middle
a gold level, and
a platinum level.

00:11:10.256 --> 00:11:13.026 A:middle
Each of these levels has two
subscription in it for a total

00:11:13.026 --> 00:11:14.886 A:middle
of six subscriptions
in this sample group.

00:11:15.986 --> 00:11:19.066 A:middle
You'll also notice on the
side that we have ranks.

00:11:19.776 --> 00:11:22.676 A:middle
This is how you decide
what is considered upgrade

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.876 A:middle
and what is considered
a downgrade.

00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:29.876 A:middle
For example, if your customer
were to move from gold

00:11:29.876 --> 00:11:32.446 A:middle
to platinum, that would
be considered an upgrade,

00:11:32.446 --> 00:11:34.466 A:middle
and platinum would go
into effect right away.

00:11:35.136 --> 00:11:39.336 A:middle
If they went from gold to silver
as a downgrade, that would go

00:11:39.336 --> 00:11:41.596 A:middle
into effect at the end of
their current subscription.

00:11:41.666 --> 00:11:45.156 A:middle
Period. And those are
subscription groups.

00:11:46.146 --> 00:11:48.826 A:middle
So, I'd like to invite Jenn
up here to give us a demo

00:11:48.826 --> 00:11:50.756 A:middle
of such subscription
groups in iTunes Connect.

00:11:51.516 --> 00:11:57.056 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:57.556 --> 00:11:59.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Jennifer Makower.

00:11:59.936 --> 00:12:01.676 A:middle
I'm an engineer on the
iTunes Connect team.

00:11:59.936 --> 00:12:01.676 A:middle
I'm an engineer on the
iTunes Connect team.

00:12:01.866 --> 00:12:03.846 A:middle
I'm going to walk you
through what we have coming

00:12:03.846 --> 00:12:04.776 A:middle
for subscriptions

00:12:04.776 --> 00:12:06.576 A:middle
and subscription groups
in iTunes Connect.

00:12:07.436 --> 00:12:09.496 A:middle
We're going to be working
with my app, Meal Manager,

00:12:09.876 --> 00:12:12.536 A:middle
which provides recipe and
shopping list subscriptions

00:12:12.926 --> 00:12:14.366 A:middle
for various meal plan types.

00:12:15.186 --> 00:12:17.566 A:middle
Now, currently we have
two meal plan types.

00:12:18.066 --> 00:12:19.786 A:middle
We have a dinner meal plan type

00:12:20.286 --> 00:12:22.036 A:middle
and we have a breakfast
meal plan type.

00:12:22.036 --> 00:12:24.086 A:middle
And both of those serve as
our subscription groups.

00:12:24.086 --> 00:12:26.616 A:middle
So, we're coming out with
a new subscription type,

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:28.656 A:middle
which is going to be
our new meal plan.

00:12:28.656 --> 00:12:31.026 A:middle
It's going to be for
lunch subscriptions.

00:12:31.116 --> 00:12:32.976 A:middle
So, let's take a look in
iTunes Connect how we do that.

00:12:41.176 --> 00:12:41.626 A:middle
Here we go.

00:12:41.626 --> 00:12:44.126 A:middle
Okay. So, I'm going to click
on the plus button here,

00:12:44.126 --> 00:12:46.826 A:middle
next to in-app purchase

00:12:46.956 --> 00:12:48.926 A:middle
and select auto-renewable
subscription.

00:12:54.656 --> 00:12:55.686 A:middle
So, here's where
I'm going to come

00:12:55.686 --> 00:12:57.666 A:middle
up with my subscription name.

00:12:58.246 --> 00:13:01.576 A:middle
And when I create a new
subscription I'll be prompted

00:12:58.246 --> 00:13:01.576 A:middle
And when I create a new
subscription I'll be prompted

00:13:01.936 --> 00:13:05.236 A:middle
in a moment to select either
an existing subscription group

00:13:05.656 --> 00:13:06.516 A:middle
or create a new one.

00:13:07.186 --> 00:13:09.316 A:middle
So, we'll start with the
subscription name first.

00:13:09.316 --> 00:13:11.136 A:middle
This is going to be
for our lunch plan.

00:13:11.136 --> 00:13:13.336 A:middle
So, our first subscription's
going to be

00:13:13.336 --> 00:13:14.556 A:middle
about different sandwich types.

00:13:15.146 --> 00:13:17.086 A:middle
So, I'll type in sandwiches.

00:13:17.826 --> 00:13:21.136 A:middle
And here's where I'll
put in my product ID.

00:13:21.136 --> 00:13:23.556 A:middle
Now, once I create my
product ID in this flow,

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:25.376 A:middle
it can't be edited later on.

00:13:25.456 --> 00:13:27.766 A:middle
So, I need to make sure
we put in the right one.

00:13:27.846 --> 00:13:31.496 A:middle
So, we're making
the one week version

00:13:31.496 --> 00:13:33.976 A:middle
of our sandwich subscription.

00:13:35.896 --> 00:13:38.256 A:middle
And then I'll click
next at the bottom.

00:13:39.656 --> 00:13:41.386 A:middle
So, here's where I'm going

00:13:41.386 --> 00:13:44.806 A:middle
to create our new subscription
group for our lunch plans.

00:13:48.656 --> 00:13:50.406 A:middle
And I'll type in
lunch plans here.

00:13:50.966 --> 00:13:54.546 A:middle
And then click on create.

00:13:56.686 --> 00:14:02.766 A:middle
So, what we have here is our
redesigned in-app purchase page.

00:13:56.686 --> 00:14:02.766 A:middle
So, what we have here is our
redesigned in-app purchase page.

00:14:04.086 --> 00:14:05.936 A:middle
And I'll come back to this
in a moment to walk you

00:14:05.936 --> 00:14:07.586 A:middle
through what's on this page.

00:14:07.586 --> 00:14:08.596 A:middle
But, what I want to focus

00:14:08.596 --> 00:14:10.596 A:middle
on right now is subscription
groups.

00:14:11.036 --> 00:14:14.376 A:middle
So, I'm going to go to the
top of the page here and click

00:14:14.376 --> 00:14:15.776 A:middle
on lunch plans, which
will bring us

00:14:15.776 --> 00:14:17.226 A:middle
to our subscription group page.

00:14:17.226 --> 00:14:25.146 A:middle
So, here at the top you can
see we have the sandwiches

00:14:25.176 --> 00:14:26.726 A:middle
subscription that
we just created.

00:14:27.836 --> 00:14:29.756 A:middle
Below that we have
our subscription group

00:14:29.816 --> 00:14:30.626 A:middle
reference name.

00:14:30.626 --> 00:14:35.246 A:middle
And below that we have our
localized app store metadata.

00:14:35.406 --> 00:14:37.146 A:middle
And we can add additional
languages when you want

00:14:37.226 --> 00:14:38.986 A:middle
to localize for additional
languages.

00:14:40.056 --> 00:14:42.236 A:middle
As well we can go here

00:14:42.236 --> 00:14:44.636 A:middle
to override the app
name if we want to.

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:47.856 A:middle
So, in this case my app name
is Meal Manager, Recipes,

00:14:47.856 --> 00:14:50.366 A:middle
and Shopping lists, which is
a little bit too long to show

00:14:50.366 --> 00:14:52.046 A:middle
up on the account
management page.

00:14:52.536 --> 00:14:54.146 A:middle
So, that would get truncated.

00:14:54.456 --> 00:14:56.836 A:middle
So, I'm going to
select use custom name,

00:14:56.836 --> 00:15:00.816 A:middle
and just use the short version
of our app, Meal Manager,

00:14:56.836 --> 00:15:00.816 A:middle
and just use the short version
of our app, Meal Manager,

00:15:02.676 --> 00:15:04.816 A:middle
and then go to the top of
the page and click save.

00:15:05.776 --> 00:15:08.246 A:middle
So, what I'd like to
show you next is how

00:15:08.246 --> 00:15:11.006 A:middle
to arrange multiple
subscriptions

00:15:11.006 --> 00:15:12.926 A:middle
to create an upgrade
and downgrade path.

00:15:12.926 --> 00:15:15.646 A:middle
So, I'm going to move over
to our breakfast plans,

00:15:16.376 --> 00:15:20.926 A:middle
which has a number of
subscriptions already in it.

00:15:21.776 --> 00:15:25.736 A:middle
And what we can do here is
arrange these subscriptions

00:15:25.766 --> 00:15:29.506 A:middle
so that they're in an order of
our upgrade and downgrade path.

00:15:31.116 --> 00:15:33.116 A:middle
So, first is our full course,

00:15:33.116 --> 00:15:34.646 A:middle
which will be our
highest level of service.

00:15:34.946 --> 00:15:36.966 A:middle
So, I'm going to pull that
out of the grouping here

00:15:36.966 --> 00:15:37.926 A:middle
and move it to the top.

00:15:39.166 --> 00:15:42.706 A:middle
And I'm going to take both
versions of the subscription.

00:15:42.706 --> 00:15:44.136 A:middle
We have a one week
and a one month.

00:15:44.586 --> 00:15:48.956 A:middle
And within one ranking
here this basically,

00:15:48.956 --> 00:15:53.626 A:middle
this can have differences
of either price or duration.

00:15:53.916 --> 00:15:56.746 A:middle
The main idea here is
that they're moving

00:15:56.746 --> 00:15:58.096 A:middle
between these two subscriptions.

00:15:58.096 --> 00:15:59.676 A:middle
It's neither an upgrade
or a downgrade.

00:16:00.156 --> 00:16:05.926 A:middle
And then I'll take omelets only
and move that to the bottom,

00:16:05.976 --> 00:16:07.976 A:middle
which is our lowest
level of service.

00:16:14.256 --> 00:16:16.196 A:middle
And then I'll click
save on the top here.

00:16:16.746 --> 00:16:21.026 A:middle
So, as Daniel explained,
all these subscriptions

00:16:21.026 --> 00:16:22.966 A:middle
within this group are
mutually exclusive.

00:16:23.516 --> 00:16:25.466 A:middle
So, a customer would
only have one

00:16:25.466 --> 00:16:26.846 A:middle
of these subscriptions
at a time.

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:30.606 A:middle
If your intention is to
have your customer have two

00:16:30.636 --> 00:16:33.236 A:middle
subscriptions, they would need
to be in two separate groups.

00:16:34.516 --> 00:16:37.376 A:middle
So, now this is arranged in
my upgrade and downgrade path.

00:16:37.376 --> 00:16:41.416 A:middle
So, full course subscriptions
are the highest level

00:16:41.416 --> 00:16:41.966 A:middle
of service.

00:16:42.486 --> 00:16:43.686 A:middle
Muffins and omelets, movies

00:16:43.686 --> 00:16:47.046 A:middle
and omelets are my mid-range
subscription level of service.

00:16:47.396 --> 00:16:49.586 A:middle
And omelets only is my
lowest level of service.

00:16:49.586 --> 00:16:51.416 A:middle
And you can actually
have as many levels

00:16:51.616 --> 00:16:53.116 A:middle
of subscriptions as you want.

00:16:53.156 --> 00:16:54.386 A:middle
We just say three for now.

00:16:54.386 --> 00:16:56.346 A:middle
But, you can see the numbering

00:16:56.346 --> 00:16:58.996 A:middle
on the side here
indicates which level it is.

00:16:59.646 --> 00:17:01.336 A:middle
And that is about
subscription groups.

00:16:59.646 --> 00:17:01.336 A:middle
And that is about
subscription groups.

00:17:01.416 --> 00:17:02.976 A:middle
I'll give it back to Daniel.

00:17:03.516 --> 00:17:07.006 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:07.506 --> 00:17:07.955 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jenn.

00:17:10.386 --> 00:17:10.726 A:middle
All right.

00:17:11.506 --> 00:17:16.046 A:middle
Now, let's move into how we'll
be changing the way you plan

00:17:16.046 --> 00:17:18.195 A:middle
price changes with
auto-renewables.

00:17:19.026 --> 00:17:20.986 A:middle
Will start with territory
pricing.

00:17:22.336 --> 00:17:25.786 A:middle
Today when you price an
auto-renewable subscription,

00:17:26.826 --> 00:17:29.466 A:middle
you choose one price tier
for the entire world.

00:17:30.876 --> 00:17:35.506 A:middle
Behind the scenes, this price
tier is associated with prices

00:17:35.556 --> 00:17:38.026 A:middle
in individual territories
around the world.

00:17:38.526 --> 00:17:41.526 A:middle
Now, we at Apple today manage
these prices on your behalf.

00:17:42.106 --> 00:17:44.686 A:middle
When there are currency
fluctuations we update these

00:17:44.726 --> 00:17:45.516 A:middle
prices for you.

00:17:46.786 --> 00:17:48.726 A:middle
Now, this has always
been convenient.

00:17:48.786 --> 00:17:51.126 A:middle
But, you asked us
for more flexibility.

00:17:51.626 --> 00:17:56.156 A:middle
So, beginning this fall, you'll
be able to price per territory.

00:17:57.516 --> 00:18:02.236 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:57.516 --> 00:18:02.236 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:02.736 --> 00:18:04.506 A:middle
The way this will work is,

00:18:04.506 --> 00:18:07.706 A:middle
instead of choosing a single
price tier, you'll start

00:18:07.706 --> 00:18:10.356 A:middle
with a base currency
and a base price.

00:18:11.346 --> 00:18:14.426 A:middle
This base price will come from
a predefined list of prices.

00:18:15.006 --> 00:18:19.056 A:middle
And as you move though the work
flow, we will generate prices

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:21.806 A:middle
for each territory
that you select based

00:18:21.806 --> 00:18:23.906 A:middle
on the current exchange
rate at the time

00:18:23.906 --> 00:18:25.196 A:middle
that you plan the price change.

00:18:27.446 --> 00:18:30.596 A:middle
After we generate these
prices, you can go in

00:18:30.656 --> 00:18:33.716 A:middle
and you can edit the
price for say Austria.

00:18:34.076 --> 00:18:38.816 A:middle
Maybe you want to change the
price here from $1.99 to $2.99.

00:18:39.276 --> 00:18:42.206 A:middle
And you can do this for one
country, or you can do this

00:18:42.206 --> 00:18:43.196 A:middle
for multiple countries.

00:18:44.406 --> 00:18:46.416 A:middle
Once you set up these
prices and you've hit save,

00:18:47.106 --> 00:18:48.636 A:middle
this price change
goes into effect

00:18:49.556 --> 00:18:51.936 A:middle
at whatever start
date you've selected.

00:18:52.866 --> 00:18:57.406 A:middle
Next let's talk about
customer attention

00:18:57.946 --> 00:18:59.576 A:middle
in the context of price changes.

00:19:00.826 --> 00:19:02.996 A:middle
So, one of the biggest
challenges today

00:19:02.996 --> 00:19:06.166 A:middle
with customer attention when we
change price is increasing the

00:19:06.166 --> 00:19:07.716 A:middle
price of subscription.

00:19:08.666 --> 00:19:13.026 A:middle
When we increase the price all
the customers that that affects,

00:19:13.196 --> 00:19:18.586 A:middle
which is all the customers,
receive an email that says

00:19:18.586 --> 00:19:22.676 A:middle
that the price has increased and
the subscriptions are stopped.

00:19:23.886 --> 00:19:26.826 A:middle
From here they have to go
into their app store app,

00:19:27.036 --> 00:19:28.206 A:middle
go into their account settings

00:19:28.386 --> 00:19:30.706 A:middle
and re-enable the
subscription at the new price.

00:19:32.066 --> 00:19:33.146 A:middle
Well, beginning this fall,

00:19:34.036 --> 00:19:38.426 A:middle
we're introducing a
streamlined consent process.

00:19:40.476 --> 00:19:44.646 A:middle
With this new process when a
customer receives price change

00:19:44.646 --> 00:19:47.946 A:middle
or a price increase they
will get a push notification

00:19:49.206 --> 00:19:50.616 A:middle
and an enhanced email.

00:19:51.536 --> 00:19:53.096 A:middle
From either the push
notification

00:19:53.166 --> 00:19:57.716 A:middle
or the email they can simply
tap and they'll go directly

00:19:57.716 --> 00:19:58.706 A:middle
into an app store page

00:19:58.706 --> 00:20:00.856 A:middle
where they can review the
new price and consent to it.

00:19:58.706 --> 00:20:00.856 A:middle
where they can review the
new price and consent to it.

00:20:01.056 --> 00:20:06.156 A:middle
This gives your customers many
more opportunities to consent

00:20:06.536 --> 00:20:08.666 A:middle
in a more direct and
understandable way.

00:20:10.516 --> 00:20:16.376 A:middle
Now, no matter how good the, no
matter how good this flow is,

00:20:17.186 --> 00:20:19.776 A:middle
if we increase the price
there's always a chance

00:20:19.816 --> 00:20:20.986 A:middle
that we can lose customers,

00:20:21.986 --> 00:20:24.916 A:middle
which is why we've added the
feature to preserve prices

00:20:24.916 --> 00:20:28.976 A:middle
for existing customers while
increasing prices for new ones.

00:20:29.516 --> 00:20:34.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:35.056 --> 00:20:36.256 A:middle
Let's take a look at
how this might work.

00:20:38.516 --> 00:20:40.316 A:middle
Let's say we're launching
a new service in Japan.

00:20:41.386 --> 00:20:44.376 A:middle
We'd like to set our
initial price at 120 yen.

00:20:46.016 --> 00:20:47.056 A:middle
So, we set that up.

00:20:48.016 --> 00:20:50.686 A:middle
And once this in-app
purchase goes live,

00:20:51.686 --> 00:20:54.616 A:middle
we'll have our early
adopters paying 120

00:20:54.616 --> 00:20:57.706 A:middle
for both new subscriptions
and renewals.

00:20:59.156 --> 00:21:00.626 A:middle
Now, after some time has passed,

00:20:59.156 --> 00:21:00.626 A:middle
Now, after some time has passed,

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:03.106 A:middle
we're ready to launch
our product formally.

00:21:03.376 --> 00:21:04.836 A:middle
So, we get our marketing
teams ready.

00:21:04.836 --> 00:21:05.866 A:middle
We do a big push.

00:21:06.426 --> 00:21:09.776 A:middle
And we like to set our
launch pricing at 240 yen.

00:21:11.196 --> 00:21:13.006 A:middle
But, when we set
this price change,

00:21:13.236 --> 00:21:15.256 A:middle
we like to keep our
early adopters at 120,

00:21:15.256 --> 00:21:16.376 A:middle
because they've been loyal.

00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:17.436 A:middle
They've been sticking with us.

00:21:17.956 --> 00:21:21.196 A:middle
So, when this new price
change goes into effect,

00:21:22.116 --> 00:21:24.646 A:middle
we'll have our launch
customers paying 240

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:26.756 A:middle
for both new subscriptions
and renewals.

00:21:26.756 --> 00:21:30.416 A:middle
And we'll have our early
adopters continuing paying 120

00:21:31.026 --> 00:21:31.916 A:middle
for their renewals.

00:21:33.726 --> 00:21:36.706 A:middle
Now, some more time passes and
we're ready to move the price

00:21:36.706 --> 00:21:38.916 A:middle
up to a new target price
that we've had in mind.

00:21:40.576 --> 00:21:43.076 A:middle
This new price is 360 yen.

00:21:43.556 --> 00:21:46.556 A:middle
But, this time when we want,
when this price change goes

00:21:46.556 --> 00:21:50.026 A:middle
into effect, we'd also like
to bring our launch customers

00:21:50.506 --> 00:21:51.546 A:middle
up to 360.

00:21:53.216 --> 00:21:54.836 A:middle
So, we set that in
our price change.

00:21:55.826 --> 00:21:59.246 A:middle
And once this goes into
effect, we have one set

00:21:59.246 --> 00:22:02.576 A:middle
of customers both launch
and post-launch paying 360.

00:21:59.246 --> 00:22:02.576 A:middle
of customers both launch
and post-launch paying 360.

00:22:03.136 --> 00:22:06.876 A:middle
And we have early adopters
still continuing at 120.

00:22:07.566 --> 00:22:10.466 A:middle
Now, notice here that the
launch customers did have their

00:22:10.466 --> 00:22:11.526 A:middle
prices increased.

00:22:11.746 --> 00:22:13.466 A:middle
So, they do get a
consent request.

00:22:15.586 --> 00:22:18.216 A:middle
Finally we've reached the
end of the year and we decide

00:22:18.876 --> 00:22:21.516 A:middle
that we're ready to simplify our
pricing going to the next year.

00:22:21.516 --> 00:22:24.806 A:middle
And we'd like to bring our
early adopters up to 360.

00:22:25.386 --> 00:22:26.496 A:middle
We go into iTunes Connect.

00:22:27.356 --> 00:22:28.796 A:middle
We edit that price change.

00:22:29.586 --> 00:22:34.726 A:middle
And once we hit save, our
early adopters move up to 360.

00:22:35.446 --> 00:22:39.076 A:middle
This change happens immediately,
unlike the other price changes

00:22:39.076 --> 00:22:40.236 A:middle
that we plan for the future.

00:22:42.086 --> 00:22:46.126 A:middle
Now, we have everybody paying
360 from here into the future

00:22:46.126 --> 00:22:48.816 A:middle
until we plan more
price changes.

00:22:49.356 --> 00:22:53.796 A:middle
Okay. I'd like to invite Jenn
back up here to give us a demo

00:22:54.356 --> 00:22:55.976 A:middle
of iTunes Connect and
the new price flow.

00:22:58.516 --> 00:23:02.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:58.516 --> 00:23:02.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:03.076 --> 00:23:04.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So to go back into
my Meal Manager app.

00:23:05.286 --> 00:23:08.206 A:middle
What we've decided to do
is market our subscriptions

00:23:08.206 --> 00:23:09.606 A:middle
with the three phrase approach.

00:23:10.176 --> 00:23:12.986 A:middle
So, when we launch a
subscription we're going to come

00:23:12.986 --> 00:23:15.746 A:middle
out with an initial price to
attract some early adopters.

00:23:16.236 --> 00:23:18.106 A:middle
And we're going to keep
them renewing at that price

00:23:18.866 --> 00:23:20.556 A:middle
for a certain amount of time,

00:23:20.786 --> 00:23:22.196 A:middle
then on our second
phase we're going

00:23:22.196 --> 00:23:23.316 A:middle
to raise the price a little,

00:23:23.316 --> 00:23:27.526 A:middle
but only do that in a
few select territories.

00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:31.026 A:middle
And then lastly we're going
move up to their target price

00:23:31.056 --> 00:23:33.706 A:middle
that we want to sell our
subscriptions at going forward.

00:23:34.226 --> 00:23:36.346 A:middle
So, let's get started
working on that.

00:23:36.386 --> 00:23:39.366 A:middle
So, I want to go
into my dinner plans.

00:23:40.056 --> 00:23:46.086 A:middle
And dessert and entree
is the next subscription

00:23:46.086 --> 00:23:47.156 A:middle
that we're going
to be releasing.

00:23:47.576 --> 00:23:49.636 A:middle
So, I need to go in and set
up some initial pricing.

00:23:50.676 --> 00:23:53.656 A:middle
So, this again is our
subscription group page.

00:23:53.966 --> 00:23:56.856 A:middle
And I can click into the
specific subscription here.

00:23:57.936 --> 00:24:01.306 A:middle
So, again this is our new
in-app purchase details page.

00:23:57.936 --> 00:24:01.306 A:middle
So, again this is our new
in-app purchase details page.

00:24:01.506 --> 00:24:03.546 A:middle
We have the reference
name at the top.

00:24:04.926 --> 00:24:08.646 A:middle
We have a subscription
duration underneath that.

00:24:09.596 --> 00:24:11.666 A:middle
We have the price
schedule below that.

00:24:11.936 --> 00:24:13.496 A:middle
And I'll come back to
that in a moment to set

00:24:13.496 --> 00:24:14.476 A:middle
up our initial pricing.

00:24:14.826 --> 00:24:20.136 A:middle
Again we have our
localized app store metadata.

00:24:20.136 --> 00:24:23.046 A:middle
And I can add additional
languages when I'm ready

00:24:23.046 --> 00:24:26.036 A:middle
to market this for
additional territories.

00:24:26.716 --> 00:24:30.266 A:middle
And then our app store,
app review information.

00:24:30.846 --> 00:24:35.456 A:middle
The screen shot should show
how our in-app purchase is,

00:24:36.096 --> 00:24:38.316 A:middle
presents itself within
the context of the app.

00:24:38.546 --> 00:24:40.496 A:middle
And we can put in some
additional app store review

00:24:40.496 --> 00:24:45.156 A:middle
notes there to help extra
find our in-app purchase.

00:24:46.106 --> 00:24:50.076 A:middle
So, I'm going to go click on set
price here below price schedule

00:24:50.876 --> 00:24:52.086 A:middle
to set up our initial pricing.

00:24:52.916 --> 00:24:54.646 A:middle
So, my base currency
is U.S. dollar.

00:24:54.646 --> 00:24:57.436 A:middle
And that can be set
as a preference

00:24:57.436 --> 00:24:57.976 A:middle
within your user profile.

00:24:58.116 --> 00:25:02.406 A:middle
And I'm going select
the initial price

00:24:58.116 --> 00:25:02.406 A:middle
And I'm going select
the initial price

00:25:02.406 --> 00:25:04.536 A:middle
for this subscription
at 99 cents.

00:25:05.566 --> 00:25:07.056 A:middle
And then click on
next at the bottom.

00:25:08.326 --> 00:25:11.376 A:middle
So, these are the prices
that were calculated based

00:25:11.376 --> 00:25:12.626 A:middle
on current exchange rates.

00:25:13.236 --> 00:25:14.696 A:middle
If one of these territories,

00:25:14.696 --> 00:25:17.556 A:middle
I have some additional licensing
fees or other business needs

00:25:17.556 --> 00:25:18.656 A:middle
and I need to raise the price

00:25:18.656 --> 00:25:21.446 A:middle
for that one particular
territory I can come in

00:25:21.446 --> 00:25:25.526 A:middle
and select this and move it
up whichever price I need to.

00:25:25.526 --> 00:25:28.926 A:middle
And if I forget which
one was the initial price

00:25:28.926 --> 00:25:30.606 A:middle
that had been calculated
I can come over here

00:25:30.606 --> 00:25:31.366 A:middle
and it will remind me.

00:25:32.376 --> 00:25:35.526 A:middle
So, I'm going to scroll
down to the bottom here

00:25:35.526 --> 00:25:36.826 A:middle
and go click on done.

00:25:38.076 --> 00:25:40.266 A:middle
And then click on okay.

00:25:40.266 --> 00:25:42.116 A:middle
So, once this subscription
goes live,

00:25:43.146 --> 00:25:45.076 A:middle
that will be our price
for the subscription.

00:25:45.746 --> 00:25:48.276 A:middle
So, I'm going to click on
save at the top of the screen.

00:25:48.796 --> 00:25:55.736 A:middle
And then go back to our
subscription group page and move

00:25:55.776 --> 00:25:58.116 A:middle
to our appetizer on
entree subscription.

00:25:58.726 --> 00:26:03.736 A:middle
So, in this case we've
launched our app.

00:25:58.726 --> 00:26:03.736 A:middle
So, in this case we've
launched our app.

00:26:03.976 --> 00:26:05.876 A:middle
We have some initial
early adopters.

00:26:06.266 --> 00:26:08.446 A:middle
And I want to raise
the price a little bit

00:26:08.446 --> 00:26:09.816 A:middle
for our next phase of marketing.

00:26:10.756 --> 00:26:13.386 A:middle
So, I'm going to click
on plan a price change.

00:26:14.576 --> 00:26:16.706 A:middle
So, as I said in this case we're
going to be raising the price,

00:26:16.736 --> 00:26:18.386 A:middle
but only in a few
select territories.

00:26:18.466 --> 00:26:21.546 A:middle
So, I'm going to pick the
United States and Canada,

00:26:22.476 --> 00:26:26.886 A:middle
Italy, Spain, and France.

00:26:27.976 --> 00:26:29.216 A:middle
And then click on next.

00:26:29.776 --> 00:26:35.956 A:middle
The price, the date for this
change will happen on June 24th.

00:26:36.506 --> 00:26:40.126 A:middle
And again, my base
currency is U.S. dollar.

00:26:40.126 --> 00:26:44.056 A:middle
And I'm going to make the
price $1.99 for this change.

00:26:45.026 --> 00:26:46.086 A:middle
And then click on next.

00:26:46.776 --> 00:26:49.916 A:middle
So, again these are the
current exchange rates for,

00:26:49.916 --> 00:26:51.876 A:middle
based on my base
price selection.

00:26:52.106 --> 00:26:54.236 A:middle
And I can see here what
the initial price was.

00:26:54.416 --> 00:26:57.826 A:middle
You know, we originally selected
99 cents for the early adopters.

00:26:57.886 --> 00:27:00.756 A:middle
And the new price will be $1.99.

00:26:57.886 --> 00:27:00.756 A:middle
And the new price will be $1.99.

00:27:00.986 --> 00:27:04.046 A:middle
And then I'll click
on next at the bottom.

00:27:04.866 --> 00:27:07.486 A:middle
And here's where we're
going to handle what to do

00:27:07.486 --> 00:27:08.706 A:middle
with our existing subscribers.

00:27:09.106 --> 00:27:11.736 A:middle
In this case we're going to
keep our early adopters renewing

00:27:11.736 --> 00:27:13.706 A:middle
at the price that they
originally subscribed at.

00:27:14.076 --> 00:27:18.046 A:middle
And this change will be for
new subscribers that come

00:27:18.046 --> 00:27:20.676 A:middle
on starting from the date
that I selected earlier.

00:27:22.436 --> 00:27:23.756 A:middle
So, I'm going to click on done.

00:27:25.436 --> 00:27:27.996 A:middle
And that change will go
into effect on June 24th.

00:27:27.996 --> 00:27:29.216 A:middle
That's the date that I selected.

00:27:29.916 --> 00:27:30.946 A:middle
And click okay.

00:27:30.946 --> 00:27:34.976 A:middle
And, so then we we'll have
two prices going forward

00:27:35.366 --> 00:27:36.906 A:middle
for this subscription.

00:27:38.096 --> 00:27:41.746 A:middle
And I can change this price
if I need to up until the date

00:27:41.776 --> 00:27:43.106 A:middle
that it goes into effect.

00:27:43.866 --> 00:27:47.276 A:middle
So, I'm going to go click on
save at the top of the screen.

00:27:48.766 --> 00:27:53.936 A:middle
And then go back to our
subscription group page and move

00:27:53.936 --> 00:27:55.596 A:middle
to our entree only subscription.

00:27:59.516 --> 00:28:02.656 A:middle
Now in this case we've gone
through those two phases

00:27:59.516 --> 00:28:02.656 A:middle
Now in this case we've gone
through those two phases

00:28:02.776 --> 00:28:05.836 A:middle
of marketing and we're
ready to raise the price

00:28:05.836 --> 00:28:07.446 A:middle
to our target price
that we wanted

00:28:07.446 --> 00:28:08.976 A:middle
to sell the subscription
at going forward.

00:28:09.686 --> 00:28:11.896 A:middle
So, I'm going to click on
plan a price change here

00:28:11.896 --> 00:28:12.646 A:middle
in the price schedule.

00:28:13.556 --> 00:28:14.616 A:middle
And now in this case I'm going

00:28:14.616 --> 00:28:15.956 A:middle
to apply this to
all territories.

00:28:16.366 --> 00:28:18.376 A:middle
So, I click this
box at the top here

00:28:19.006 --> 00:28:21.216 A:middle
and click next at
the bottom here.

00:28:22.206 --> 00:28:26.206 A:middle
Again our date for our marketing
campaign will be the 24th.

00:28:26.496 --> 00:28:27.506 A:middle
So, I'll select that date.

00:28:28.396 --> 00:28:34.106 A:middle
And the price change will be
$2.99 for this subscription.

00:28:34.106 --> 00:28:35.156 A:middle
Again, select next.

00:28:35.776 --> 00:28:40.056 A:middle
And once again we have
the calculated prices.

00:28:40.336 --> 00:28:44.156 A:middle
And I can see that the last
price change we had was $1.99

00:28:44.156 --> 00:28:44.626 A:middle
on March 18th.

00:28:45.856 --> 00:28:48.486 A:middle
And our new price is
going to be $2.99.

00:28:49.246 --> 00:28:50.706 A:middle
So, I've clicked
next at the bottom.

00:28:51.346 --> 00:28:57.556 A:middle
Now in this case for our
existing subscribers,

00:28:57.706 --> 00:29:01.006 A:middle
the last price change, I want to
move anyone that had subscribed

00:28:57.706 --> 00:29:01.006 A:middle
the last price change, I want to
move anyone that had subscribed

00:29:01.096 --> 00:29:03.556 A:middle
after that point up
to this new pricing.

00:29:03.836 --> 00:29:06.336 A:middle
But, we're still going to keep
our early adopters at their,

00:29:06.336 --> 00:29:09.206 A:middle
renewing at that original
price that they had.

00:29:09.236 --> 00:29:10.836 A:middle
So, this change I only want

00:29:10.836 --> 00:29:14.826 A:middle
to affect just the existing
subscribers that came in since

00:29:14.876 --> 00:29:16.116 A:middle
that last price change.

00:29:16.506 --> 00:29:19.886 A:middle
So, in this case I'm going
to select apply price change

00:29:19.886 --> 00:29:21.066 A:middle
to existing subscribers.

00:29:22.446 --> 00:29:24.266 A:middle
And I've applied it
to all territories.

00:29:24.266 --> 00:29:26.796 A:middle
But, I can go and select
individual territories

00:29:26.796 --> 00:29:28.486 A:middle
that this would apply
to if I needed to.

00:29:29.366 --> 00:29:31.456 A:middle
And I can see here, it
says existing subscribers,

00:29:31.636 --> 00:29:34.756 A:middle
$1.99 subscribers
will now pay $2.99.

00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:36.916 A:middle
And that is what I want to do.

00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:38.436 A:middle
So, I'm going to click on next.

00:29:38.966 --> 00:29:43.966 A:middle
And it's important to note that
once this price change goes

00:29:43.966 --> 00:29:45.566 A:middle
into effect it cannot
be changed.

00:29:46.216 --> 00:29:50.736 A:middle
And once it does go into effect,
the user that will be renewing,

00:29:50.976 --> 00:29:54.476 A:middle
that will have their price
effected, will be notified

00:29:54.476 --> 00:29:55.266 A:middle
that their price has changed.

00:29:55.266 --> 00:29:56.406 A:middle
And they will need to consent

00:29:56.406 --> 00:29:58.936 A:middle
to that higher price before
their subscription renews.

00:29:59.636 --> 00:30:01.976 A:middle
So, that is what we want to do.

00:29:59.636 --> 00:30:01.976 A:middle
So, that is what we want to do.

00:30:02.046 --> 00:30:04.986 A:middle
So, I'm going to go ahead and
select the check box here,

00:30:05.346 --> 00:30:10.056 A:middle
and then click done,
and then click on okay.

00:30:10.416 --> 00:30:14.146 A:middle
So, once this price change
goes into effect, it will be --

00:30:14.146 --> 00:30:16.346 A:middle
you won't be able to
go back and change it.

00:30:16.346 --> 00:30:18.296 A:middle
But, we can edit it
up until that point

00:30:18.386 --> 00:30:19.426 A:middle
that it goes into effect.

00:30:20.646 --> 00:30:25.336 A:middle
So, I'm going to select save
at the top here and go back

00:30:25.336 --> 00:30:26.816 A:middle
to our subscription group page.

00:30:27.286 --> 00:30:29.166 A:middle
And for our last task
we're going to a look

00:30:29.166 --> 00:30:30.576 A:middle
at our full course subscription.

00:30:34.406 --> 00:30:38.116 A:middle
So, now in this case we have hit
the target price that we wanted.

00:30:38.406 --> 00:30:42.576 A:middle
And it's time to move those
early adopters into our pricing

00:30:42.576 --> 00:30:44.886 A:middle
so we can simplify the
price for this subscription.

00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:48.126 A:middle
So, I want us to take a
look at what we have here.

00:30:48.126 --> 00:30:49.846 A:middle
I want to click on the
March 18th date here.

00:30:50.326 --> 00:30:53.396 A:middle
And I can see that
the current price

00:30:53.396 --> 00:30:56.096 A:middle
for new subscribers is $4.99.

00:30:56.096 --> 00:30:58.116 A:middle
And I can even see
what my proceeds are

00:30:58.196 --> 00:31:00.016 A:middle
for the first year
for new subscribers.

00:30:58.196 --> 00:31:00.016 A:middle
for the first year
for new subscribers.

00:31:00.016 --> 00:31:02.746 A:middle
And if they stay
with us for a year

00:31:02.746 --> 00:31:06.216 A:middle
or more I can see what my
proceeds will be for, from that.

00:31:06.216 --> 00:31:08.906 A:middle
So, I'm going to click on done.

00:31:10.316 --> 00:31:14.156 A:middle
But, what I want to do is raise
our early adopter price up.

00:31:14.466 --> 00:31:16.406 A:middle
So, I'm going to click
on initial price here.

00:31:17.066 --> 00:31:19.586 A:middle
And here I can see that these
subscribers are paying 99 cents.

00:31:19.586 --> 00:31:21.716 A:middle
So, we want to move them up.

00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:24.636 A:middle
So, I'm going to click on
show price change options.

00:31:26.066 --> 00:31:28.746 A:middle
And here I can see
the again, 99 cents.

00:31:28.746 --> 00:31:31.606 A:middle
And that the current is $4.99.

00:31:31.606 --> 00:31:34.456 A:middle
So, I'm going to click
this check box up here.

00:31:34.906 --> 00:31:36.406 A:middle
That will apply it
to all territories.

00:31:36.666 --> 00:31:39.366 A:middle
And again, if I need to I can
selected individual territories

00:31:39.366 --> 00:31:42.506 A:middle
to apply this to if I
want to do it that way.

00:31:42.506 --> 00:31:46.196 A:middle
So, here it says 99 cent
subscribers will pay $4.99.

00:31:46.196 --> 00:31:48.466 A:middle
That will simplify a pricing
for this subscription.

00:31:49.006 --> 00:31:50.516 A:middle
So, I'm going to go
ahead and click next.

00:31:52.006 --> 00:31:54.476 A:middle
Now in this case, the
price change will take

00:31:54.556 --> 00:31:55.686 A:middle
effect immediately.

00:31:56.086 --> 00:31:58.176 A:middle
So, as soon as I
click save, that's it.

00:31:58.296 --> 00:31:59.836 A:middle
It cannot be edited or changed.

00:32:00.356 --> 00:32:03.866 A:middle
So, they will, and when
the Windows subscribers,

00:32:04.466 --> 00:32:06.826 A:middle
when it's time for them to renew
they will get the agreement.

00:32:07.026 --> 00:32:11.546 A:middle
You know, the consent request
to consent to the higher price

00:32:11.546 --> 00:32:13.896 A:middle
for this subscription
before the subscription will

00:32:13.896 --> 00:32:14.786 A:middle
automatically renew.

00:32:15.976 --> 00:32:17.046 A:middle
And that is what we want to do.

00:32:17.316 --> 00:32:18.586 A:middle
So, I'm going to go ahead

00:32:18.586 --> 00:32:24.486 A:middle
and select the check box
here and then click done.

00:32:25.916 --> 00:32:28.796 A:middle
And then click on okay.

00:32:28.796 --> 00:32:32.576 A:middle
And now we have one price
for the subscription.

00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:35.216 A:middle
So, once I click save
that will save the changes

00:32:35.216 --> 00:32:36.906 A:middle
and it will not be
able to be edited.

00:32:37.446 --> 00:32:39.976 A:middle
And that is territory pricing.

00:32:40.516 --> 00:32:43.656 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:44.156 --> 00:32:44.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks again, Jenn.

00:32:45.616 --> 00:32:48.166 A:middle
All right.

00:32:48.166 --> 00:32:49.666 A:middle
So, we talked about a
lot of things today.

00:32:50.846 --> 00:32:53.056 A:middle
So, a quick recap of
what those items were.

00:32:53.646 --> 00:32:55.496 A:middle
We talked about increased
proceeds.

00:32:56.256 --> 00:32:59.826 A:middle
You'll be receiving 85%
proceeds for any customers

00:32:59.826 --> 00:33:02.506 A:middle
that haven't subscribed
for one year or more.

00:32:59.826 --> 00:33:02.506 A:middle
that haven't subscribed
for one year or more.

00:33:04.216 --> 00:33:06.506 A:middle
We're expanding to
all categories

00:33:06.506 --> 00:33:07.956 A:middle
for auto-renewable
subscriptions.

00:33:09.786 --> 00:33:11.426 A:middle
We're giving you the
ability to define,

00:33:11.426 --> 00:33:12.896 A:middle
upgraded, and downgrade paths.

00:33:13.596 --> 00:33:17.626 A:middle
We're allowing you to
price per territory.

00:33:19.786 --> 00:33:22.306 A:middle
We're streamlining
the consent work flow.

00:33:22.546 --> 00:33:26.916 A:middle
And we're giving you the
ability to preserve prices

00:33:26.916 --> 00:33:30.686 A:middle
for existing customers while
increasing prices for new ones.

00:33:31.636 --> 00:33:36.046 A:middle
