00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:37.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, developers.

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:38.806 A:middle
What a great venue.

00:00:39.176 --> 00:00:40.436 A:middle
This is really great.

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:41.956 A:middle
Thanks for coming today.

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:45.236 A:middle
It's been a long day, but we've
got some really great stuff

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:45.636 A:middle
for you.

00:00:46.086 --> 00:00:47.266 A:middle
So I want to welcome you

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.896 A:middle
to the 15th Apple
Design Award Ceremony.

00:00:51.326 --> 00:00:54.266 A:middle
And we've got a ton of
great winners this evening.

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:58.146 A:middle
And we'd like to, of course,
recognize their great work.

00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:02.136 A:middle
The Apple Design Awards are all
about recognizing great work

00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:02.136 A:middle
The Apple Design Awards are all
about recognizing great work

00:01:02.136 --> 00:01:03.636 A:middle
by people in this community.

00:01:03.826 --> 00:01:08.556 A:middle
And this is the moment when many
of you -- well, many of you --

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.716 A:middle
some of you get to take home one

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:12.196 A:middle
of the Apple Design
Award Trophies,

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:15.536 A:middle
which everyone wants one.

00:01:15.656 --> 00:01:18.596 A:middle
And so we'll see who
gets one tonight.

00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:22.026 A:middle
But to start things off, I
just want to set a little bit

00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:25.086 A:middle
of context for the apps that
are going to win tonight.

00:01:26.156 --> 00:01:29.386 A:middle
The App Store opened
eight years ago.

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:32.636 A:middle
In fact, next month it'll
be exactly eight years old.

00:01:32.636 --> 00:01:35.126 A:middle
And it was on July 10th of 2008.

00:01:35.236 --> 00:01:39.556 A:middle
And in those eight
years, apps took off.

00:01:39.556 --> 00:01:40.496 A:middle
Right? They've taken off.

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:43.126 A:middle
And today, we heard 2
million apps on the App Store.

00:01:43.126 --> 00:01:45.556 A:middle
But if we just go
back for a moment

00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:48.736 A:middle
to those first days,
it was pretty crazy.

00:01:48.736 --> 00:01:51.366 A:middle
I mean, it all started off
with the iPhone, right?

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:54.496 A:middle
And we all remember
the first TV ads.

00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:56.706 A:middle
They were 30-second slots.

00:01:57.446 --> 00:01:59.636 A:middle
And in those 30-second
slots, you had five

00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:01.316 A:middle
or six apps that were featured.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:01.316 A:middle
or six apps that were featured.

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:05.436 A:middle
And so each app had five
seconds to audition with you,

00:02:05.436 --> 00:02:07.766 A:middle
the customer -- with
you, the audience.

00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:10.446 A:middle
And to make an impression

00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:12.556 A:middle
in five seconds is
a pretty big deal.

00:02:12.556 --> 00:02:18.016 A:middle
But what happened in those ads
was people would watch the ads

00:02:18.016 --> 00:02:20.286 A:middle
and they would stop
everything that they were doing

00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:22.626 A:middle
and they would pay attention to
the app that was being shown.

00:02:22.626 --> 00:02:23.866 A:middle
And within five seconds,

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:25.746 A:middle
they would have decided
whether it mattered to them

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:28.816 A:middle
and if they were going to go
and download it or buy it.

00:02:28.816 --> 00:02:30.266 A:middle
And I think that's
pretty impressive.

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:34.826 A:middle
And those apps -- basically, it
was those TV ads and those apps

00:02:35.026 --> 00:02:38.356 A:middle
that created the phrase,
"There's an app for that."

00:02:38.356 --> 00:02:39.796 A:middle
And that phrase was born.

00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:43.086 A:middle
And it was during
that time way early

00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:45.286 A:middle
on that we saw enormous
creativity.

00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:47.646 A:middle
I mean, we didn't have
this thing before.

00:02:47.756 --> 00:02:48.476 A:middle
iPhone was out.

00:02:48.476 --> 00:02:49.946 A:middle
We had this SDK.

00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:51.106 A:middle
We didn't have that before.

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:52.856 A:middle
And we saw enormous creativity.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.996 A:middle
We saw great games,
really useful

00:02:55.996 --> 00:02:57.806 A:middle
and very valuable utilities,

00:02:58.086 --> 00:03:00.536 A:middle
some pretty incredible
augmented reality,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.086 --> 00:03:00.536 A:middle
some pretty incredible
augmented reality,

00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:03.086 A:middle
and lots of other great stuff,

00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:05.056 A:middle
much of which was
really groundbreaking.

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:11.166 A:middle
And then, two years later,
the iPad was introduced.

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:13.376 A:middle
And it was introduced
not far from here

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:15.486 A:middle
at the Yerba Buena
Center of the Arts.

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:16.936 A:middle
And I remember that day.

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:18.656 A:middle
It was an incredible day.

00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:22.106 A:middle
But when the iPad
arrived in 2010,

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:24.606 A:middle
it brought a whole
new wave of apps.

00:03:25.116 --> 00:03:28.376 A:middle
And these were apps that
stopped us in our tracks.

00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:32.186 A:middle
I mean these were apps that,
when we first saw them,

00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:35.186 A:middle
they caused us to
pause and to be amazed

00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:36.846 A:middle
at what could be
done on this device.

00:03:36.846 --> 00:03:39.816 A:middle
And then we had universal
apps coming

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:42.576 A:middle
and bringing functionality
from iPad back to iPhone,

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:44.816 A:middle
and the experience of all
of the apps got better.

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:50.646 A:middle
And all of these apps early on
changed the way that we taught.

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:53.936 A:middle
They changed the way that
people learned with iPad.

00:03:54.376 --> 00:03:57.166 A:middle
They changed the way that we
shared, that we connected,

00:03:57.166 --> 00:04:00.556 A:middle
that we worked, and that
we spent our day getting


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:57.166 --> 00:04:00.556 A:middle
that we worked, and that
we spent our day getting

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:01.536 A:middle
things done.

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:04.336 A:middle
These were transformational
apps.

00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:06.286 A:middle
And then more recently,

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:10.436 A:middle
Apple Watch was introduced,
and Apple TV.

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:13.526 A:middle
And with each of these, we
saw a new wave of apps coming.

00:04:15.106 --> 00:04:17.266 A:middle
And so now, as you've
heard several times today,

00:04:17.576 --> 00:04:20.016 A:middle
we've got four platforms
for you.

00:04:20.616 --> 00:04:21.896 A:middle
And this is amazing.

00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:24.836 A:middle
I mean, for me, being
at Apple 16 years,

00:04:24.836 --> 00:04:26.496 A:middle
I remember when it
was just the Mac

00:04:26.806 --> 00:04:29.246 A:middle
and there was some
great work going on.

00:04:29.886 --> 00:04:34.776 A:middle
And then everything took
off, and now the Mac is part

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:36.416 A:middle
of that whole ecosystem.

00:04:36.416 --> 00:04:39.046 A:middle
And there's a tremendous
opportunity for you

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:40.746 A:middle
with these four platforms.

00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:43.776 A:middle
And we're starting to see
some really great work

00:04:43.776 --> 00:04:46.036 A:middle
from developers on
these four platforms,

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:48.556 A:middle
and a few of those will
be honored here tonight.

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:53.156 A:middle
Now, tonight's winners
have created apps that are,

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:57.216 A:middle
once again, that set a
benchmark for excellence.

00:04:58.226 --> 00:05:01.726 A:middle
And they set a benchmark
for excellence in usability,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:58.226 --> 00:05:01.726 A:middle
And they set a benchmark
for excellence in usability,

00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:11.586 A:middle
excellence in design, excellent
innovation, and excellence

00:05:11.586 --> 00:05:12.846 A:middle
in technology adoption.

00:05:13.526 --> 00:05:16.286 A:middle
And if you've been part of
the Apple Design Awards before

00:05:16.286 --> 00:05:18.036 A:middle
or ever heard me speak, you know

00:05:18.036 --> 00:05:20.816 A:middle
that that's not all
there is to a great app.

00:05:21.026 --> 00:05:24.006 A:middle
There's even more that we
look for in winning apps.

00:05:24.446 --> 00:05:27.086 A:middle
We're always looking for
whether the app is compelling

00:05:27.086 --> 00:05:29.176 A:middle
and leaves a great
first impression.

00:05:29.856 --> 00:05:32.476 A:middle
We're always looking for
whether an app is engaging,

00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:35.646 A:middle
meaning it draws you
in and keeps you there,

00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:38.096 A:middle
and then gets you coming
back again and again.

00:05:38.706 --> 00:05:40.166 A:middle
That's a big challenge for apps.

00:05:41.296 --> 00:05:43.576 A:middle
We look for apps that are
enabling, that allow you

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:45.866 A:middle
to do things you
could never do before.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:49.046 A:middle
We're looking for
state-of-the-art apps of course.

00:05:49.136 --> 00:05:51.126 A:middle
We're looking for
accessible apps.

00:05:51.126 --> 00:05:52.976 A:middle
We're looking for
localized apps.

00:05:52.976 --> 00:05:55.606 A:middle
Because accessible and
localized apps mean

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:58.326 A:middle
that those apps are available
to an even wider audience

00:05:58.726 --> 00:06:02.026 A:middle
than they were prior to being
accessible and localized.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.726 --> 00:06:02.026 A:middle
than they were prior to being
accessible and localized.

00:06:02.026 --> 00:06:04.556 A:middle
And so there's a lot
of stuff that we look

00:06:04.626 --> 00:06:07.696 A:middle
for in winning apps, and these
are just some of the things

00:06:07.856 --> 00:06:09.226 A:middle
that we watch for
in winning apps.

00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:11.346 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:06:11.346 --> 00:06:15.036 A:middle
Let's start with apps that
were written by students.

00:06:15.956 --> 00:06:21.526 A:middle
So you've heard today that we
had 350 scholarship winners this

00:06:21.526 --> 00:06:23.886 A:middle
year at WWDC, which
is a record number.

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:27.296 A:middle
And these folks, these
students, had to submit an app.

00:06:27.606 --> 00:06:29.226 A:middle
As part of the scholarship
process,

00:06:29.516 --> 00:06:32.506 A:middle
they had to submit an app that
was either written explicitly

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:35.156 A:middle
for the scholarship
selection process,

00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:37.066 A:middle
or they could just
tell us about an app

00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:38.916 A:middle
that they had already
developed and put on --

00:06:38.916 --> 00:06:41.036 A:middle
that was already
on the App Store.

00:06:41.036 --> 00:06:42.576 A:middle
And we looked through
all these apps

00:06:42.576 --> 00:06:44.436 A:middle
and we found some
pretty cool stuff.

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:47.906 A:middle
So tonight we want to
award two student winners.

00:06:48.556 --> 00:06:52.966 A:middle
And the first is Linum by
Joaquin Vila from Mexico.

[ Applause ]

00:07:12.396 --> 00:07:12.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much.

00:07:12.786 --> 00:07:13.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

[ Music ]

00:07:21.346 --> 00:07:25.526 A:middle
All right, so Joaquin
started developing this app

00:07:25.776 --> 00:07:29.106 A:middle
after he had applied for a
job at a local game developer,

00:07:29.106 --> 00:07:30.426 A:middle
and that hadn't worked out.

00:07:30.666 --> 00:07:32.976 A:middle
And he decided after
that that, like,

00:07:33.466 --> 00:07:35.676 A:middle
he could just do
this on his own.

00:07:35.796 --> 00:07:37.536 A:middle
He didn't need to work
for no other developer.

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:41.846 A:middle
So he decided to write his own
app, get it on the App Store.

00:07:42.146 --> 00:07:45.556 A:middle
And I'd like to show
you this app.

00:07:45.676 --> 00:07:47.546 A:middle
And before I do, I just wanted

00:07:47.546 --> 00:07:52.036 A:middle
to say Joaquin was a 2015
Scholarship Winner last year

00:07:52.126 --> 00:07:53.746 A:middle
at WWDC, so probably
learned a lot

00:07:53.746 --> 00:07:56.646 A:middle
about what you used
in the app last year.

00:07:56.646 --> 00:08:00.726 A:middle
And he's also super active in
the local developer community


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:56.646 --> 00:08:00.726 A:middle
And he's also super active in
the local developer community

00:08:00.726 --> 00:08:02.146 A:middle
in many of the meetups
in his hometown.

00:08:02.146 --> 00:08:07.156 A:middle
All right, so I'm just going to
show you this on this screen.

00:08:07.156 --> 00:08:09.616 A:middle
So what you're seeing here
is Linum is a puzzle game

00:08:09.796 --> 00:08:12.036 A:middle
where the goal is
to complete levels

00:08:12.036 --> 00:08:13.606 A:middle
in the fewest moves possible.

00:08:13.606 --> 00:08:17.566 A:middle
And what you're trying to do is
take these line nodes and lines

00:08:17.566 --> 00:08:21.086 A:middle
and pivot them around to connect
with nodes to solve the puzzles.

00:08:21.556 --> 00:08:23.396 A:middle
And as the number
of nodes increases,

00:08:23.696 --> 00:08:26.246 A:middle
complex puzzles challenge
even the best players.

00:08:26.246 --> 00:08:30.346 A:middle
And the beauty of Linum

00:09:23.066 --> 00:09:23.186 A:middle

There's three guys.

00:09:25.316 --> 00:09:29.746 A:middle
So all three of these guys, one
of whom is here, are students

00:09:29.746 --> 00:09:31.706 A:middle
at the Rochester
Institute of Technology

00:09:31.706 --> 00:09:32.936 A:middle
in Northern New York State.

00:09:33.366 --> 00:09:37.676 A:middle
And at RIT, they went to an iOS
development challenge earlier

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:38.146 A:middle
this year.

00:09:38.146 --> 00:09:39.106 A:middle
And it was at that event

00:09:39.106 --> 00:09:41.906 A:middle
that they started
working on this game.

00:09:41.906 --> 00:09:43.656 A:middle
And Josh is the programmer.

00:09:43.656 --> 00:09:44.226 A:middle
Is it Josh?

00:09:44.366 --> 00:09:44.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

And Erik is the guy who created
the soundtrack for the game

00:09:51.226 --> 00:09:53.826 A:middle
but also kind of kept you
guys on track, you know,

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:55.126 A:middle
in terms of development.

this game for a minute.

00:09:55.356 --> 00:10:00.166 A:middle
So let me just show you
this game for a minute.

00:10:00.216 --> 00:10:05.516 A:middle
So Dividr is this fun and
addicting 2D arcade game.

00:10:05.516 --> 00:10:09.046 A:middle
And it makes use of 3D
touch of variant pressure

00:10:09.316 --> 00:10:13.856 A:middle
to move the control
squares in and out depending

00:10:13.856 --> 00:10:15.606 A:middle
on the pressure that
you apply to the screen.

00:10:15.896 --> 00:10:18.086 A:middle
So the more pressure you
apply, the further out they go.

00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:20.316 A:middle
The lighter on you are,
the closer in they go.

00:10:20.426 --> 00:10:24.546 A:middle
And you're basically avoiding
these obstacles on screen.

00:10:25.026 --> 00:10:27.696 A:middle
It's simple and compelling,
written entirely

00:10:27.696 --> 00:10:29.856 A:middle
in Swift, supports Game Center.

00:10:30.126 --> 00:10:32.926 A:middle

doubt, a great choice

00:10:33.036 --> 00:10:34.846 A:middle

[ Music ]

00:12:02.246 --> 00:12:05.736 A:middle
All right, so Frame.io is a
video collaboration platform

00:12:05.736 --> 00:12:08.126 A:middle
for teens working
together on film or video.

00:12:08.126 --> 00:12:12.886 A:middle
And it lets these teens easily
share files, give feedback,

00:12:13.246 --> 00:12:17.336 A:middle
review clips, approve media,
and do a whole ton of stuff

00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:19.296 A:middle
in that creative pro workflow.

00:12:19.296 --> 00:12:23.706 A:middle
And it turns out that it's
really hard to do this right.

00:12:24.306 --> 00:12:28.116 A:middle
And Frame.io nails it
by filling a big gap

00:12:28.116 --> 00:12:32.036 A:middle
in the creator pro workflow by
solving this complicated task.

00:12:32.756 --> 00:12:35.186 A:middle
And to give you a better
idea of how this app works,

00:12:35.486 --> 00:12:37.526 A:middle
I'd like to ask Michael
to demo it to us now.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:38.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, John.

00:12:39.296 --> 00:12:42.296 A:middle
So this is a typical
project in Frame.io.

00:12:42.296 --> 00:12:45.496 A:middle
Now it's really media-centric,
so you can see all the media

00:12:45.496 --> 00:12:47.576 A:middle
in the lower half of the view.

00:12:48.046 --> 00:12:48.726 A:middle
Now -- whoops.

00:12:50.286 --> 00:12:54.296 A:middle
So basically what they've
done here is they've made a

00:12:54.296 --> 00:12:57.626 A:middle
UICollectionViewFlowLayout
with UIKit dynamics,

00:12:57.946 --> 00:13:00.386 A:middle
and that really makes
this view come alive.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:57.946 --> 00:13:00.386 A:middle
and that really makes
this view come alive.

00:13:00.386 --> 00:13:03.816 A:middle
Now at the top, you can see
all the project participants.

00:13:04.266 --> 00:13:07.086 A:middle
Now this is a really fun
and interactive animation.

00:13:07.916 --> 00:13:10.286 A:middle
And that's really cool,
and I can do it slow.

00:13:10.286 --> 00:13:10.716 A:middle
There we go.

00:13:10.776 --> 00:13:12.696 A:middle
And that's using core animation

00:13:12.696 --> 00:13:14.076 A:middle
with custom curves
and key frames.

00:13:14.416 --> 00:13:17.006 A:middle
That opens up to a table
list view where I can swipe

00:13:17.326 --> 00:13:20.726 A:middle
to remove someone from a project
or leave the project myself.

00:13:21.956 --> 00:13:25.556 A:middle
Now the media player is
really key to Frame.io.

00:13:26.046 --> 00:13:28.696 A:middle
And so what they've done here
is they've implemented 3D touch,

00:13:29.446 --> 00:13:30.956 A:middle
and they've done this in a
number of different ways.

00:13:31.236 --> 00:13:33.126 A:middle
The first one is a feature
they call Touch Scrub.

00:13:33.126 --> 00:13:37.986 A:middle
So on this clip of this mountain
-- all I'm going to do is scrub

00:13:38.126 --> 00:13:40.046 A:middle
across this clip very lightly.

00:13:40.046 --> 00:13:41.176 A:middle
And you can see I
get an overview

00:13:41.176 --> 00:13:42.536 A:middle
of the clip really quickly.

00:13:43.196 --> 00:13:45.036 A:middle
Now the other thing that they've
done is they've gone deeper

00:13:45.036 --> 00:13:46.246 A:middle
and implemented peak and pop.

00:13:46.396 --> 00:13:48.636 A:middle
So on this clip, I'm
going to push gently.

00:13:48.756 --> 00:13:49.486 A:middle
That peaks in.

00:13:49.936 --> 00:13:50.896 A:middle
And now watch this.

00:13:50.896 --> 00:13:53.766 A:middle
When I pop, it goes
to the same frame

00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:55.546 A:middle
into a new view --
the Comment View.

00:13:55.546 --> 00:13:56.556 A:middle
Pretty cool stuff.

00:13:57.416 --> 00:13:59.236 A:middle
Now the Comment View is

00:13:59.236 --> 00:14:01.666 A:middle
where all the project
participants come in


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.236 --> 00:14:01.666 A:middle
where all the project
participants come in

00:14:01.666 --> 00:14:02.786 A:middle
and actually collaborate.

00:14:03.126 --> 00:14:04.976 A:middle
All these comments
are time-synchronized.

00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:07.956 A:middle
So when I touch something,
it actually goes to the frame

00:14:07.956 --> 00:14:08.956 A:middle
where the comment was made.

00:14:09.386 --> 00:14:12.326 A:middle
You'll also notice that all
the commenter's pictures turn

00:14:12.326 --> 00:14:13.026 A:middle
to a Play button.

00:14:13.026 --> 00:14:15.556 A:middle
So for example, here you
can see that Play button.

00:14:15.556 --> 00:14:17.696 A:middle
If I touch the Play
button, it's a feature

00:14:17.696 --> 00:14:20.316 A:middle
that they call Comment Replay

00:14:20.316 --> 00:14:22.536 A:middle
where it will start
playing two seconds before

00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:23.766 A:middle
and two seconds after.

00:14:23.766 --> 00:14:28.016 A:middle
And then where the comment
is, the comment flashes

00:14:28.016 --> 00:14:29.216 A:middle
and the phone will vibrate.

00:14:29.256 --> 00:14:29.976 A:middle
One more time.

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:31.386 A:middle
And here's the comment.

00:14:31.966 --> 00:14:32.986 A:middle
That's where it is.

00:14:33.676 --> 00:14:38.136 A:middle
So I'm going to let this video
play out just a little bit

00:14:38.136 --> 00:14:39.886 A:middle
because I know that there's
something wrong in here --

00:14:40.516 --> 00:14:43.146 A:middle
and there's a lion
in my surf video.

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:45.356 A:middle
You know, like, really?

00:14:45.496 --> 00:14:50.226 A:middle
So I'm going to put my
comment in, but I'm also going

00:14:50.226 --> 00:14:53.636 A:middle
to go ahead and annotate
and send that comment along.

00:14:55.676 --> 00:14:58.496 A:middle
So this app is incredible.

00:14:58.576 --> 00:14:59.986 A:middle

enough of this game.

like to ask Allan and Mark.

00:16:48.416 --> 00:16:51.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great. So thank you, John.

00:16:52.216 --> 00:16:52.876 A:middle
Hello, everyone.

00:16:53.176 --> 00:16:56.576 A:middle
Chameleon Run is
a super fast-paced

00:16:56.576 --> 00:16:58.966 A:middle
and very challenging auto-runner

00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:02.006 A:middle
with a twist that's
based on color.

00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:02.006 A:middle
with a twist that's
based on color.

00:17:02.006 --> 00:17:04.566 A:middle
And it has a really
stunning visual presentation

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:05.776 A:middle
which we'd like to show you now.

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:08.026 A:middle
My colleague, Mark,
is joining us.

00:17:08.256 --> 00:17:10.925 A:middle
He's going to play while I
tell you about this game.

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:13.846 A:middle
So the objective of
Chameleon Run is to make it

00:17:13.846 --> 00:17:15.726 A:middle
through the level in
the best possible time.

00:17:15.726 --> 00:17:18.276 A:middle
And Mark is jumping from
platform to platform.

00:17:18.445 --> 00:17:21.616 A:middle
But if you notice, when he lands
on a platform, sometimes he has

00:17:21.925 --> 00:17:24.286 A:middle
to switch the character's color

00:17:24.566 --> 00:17:26.636 A:middle
to match the platform
he's landing on.

00:17:26.636 --> 00:17:28.566 A:middle
And that becomes
very challenging

00:17:28.566 --> 00:17:30.696 A:middle
as you make your way
through this game.

00:17:31.476 --> 00:17:33.226 A:middle
OK, so that was a
very easy level.

00:17:33.226 --> 00:17:34.896 A:middle
Let's do it one more time
because I want to point

00:17:34.896 --> 00:17:36.916 A:middle
out a couple more
things on this level,

00:17:37.066 --> 00:17:39.226 A:middle
especially the rendering
effects.

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:42.306 A:middle
That was something that we
really loved about this game.

00:17:42.306 --> 00:17:45.176 A:middle
If you take a look at the
depth of field with the objects

00:17:45.176 --> 00:17:48.516 A:middle
in the background, the
shock waves coming off

00:17:48.516 --> 00:17:51.016 A:middle
of the character, and
also the smoke trails

00:17:51.016 --> 00:17:52.726 A:middle
and just the particle effect.

00:17:52.726 --> 00:17:55.706 A:middle
We thought that all of that
really added something visually

00:17:55.706 --> 00:17:56.606 A:middle
to this game.

00:17:57.106 --> 00:17:58.686 A:middle
But, OK, so we did
very well there.

00:17:58.686 --> 00:17:59.846 A:middle
That was an easy level.

00:17:59.846 --> 00:18:00.856 A:middle
And now Mark is going to go

And now Mark is going to go

00:18:00.856 --> 00:18:04.006 A:middle
for something much,
much more difficult.

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:06.126 A:middle
Go all the way.

00:18:06.246 --> 00:18:07.616 A:middle
All right, here we go.

00:18:07.616 --> 00:18:09.146 A:middle
Level 15, The End is Near.

00:18:09.886 --> 00:18:13.016 A:middle
And let me tell you a little bit
about why we chose this game.

00:18:13.086 --> 00:18:17.156 A:middle
So first of all, as I said,
we love the visual style

00:18:17.156 --> 00:18:20.426 A:middle
and just the vibrancy of
the colors in this game.

00:18:20.426 --> 00:18:24.716 A:middle
And it was so clear that so
much care and iteration went

00:18:24.716 --> 00:18:27.166 A:middle
into the construction
of the levels

00:18:27.166 --> 00:18:30.156 A:middle
and just fine-tuning
this content.

00:18:30.936 --> 00:18:33.296 A:middle
Then the second thing --
Mark is doing very well.

00:18:33.296 --> 00:18:33.666 A:middle
All right.

00:18:33.826 --> 00:18:34.256 A:middle
Nice.

00:18:35.516 --> 00:18:41.136 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:41.636 --> 00:18:42.566 A:middle
Do it again.

00:18:42.566 --> 00:18:42.936 A:middle
Go for it.

00:18:43.466 --> 00:18:48.486 A:middle
So the second thing
is the replayability.

00:18:49.766 --> 00:18:54.756 A:middle
Yeah, OK, that's me playing
now -- most of the time.

00:18:54.816 --> 00:18:57.576 A:middle
So the replayability in this
game is just phenomenal.

00:18:57.906 --> 00:19:00.346 A:middle
Most of these levels have
in effect a high road


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:57.906 --> 00:19:00.346 A:middle
Most of these levels have
in effect a high road

00:19:00.346 --> 00:19:01.636 A:middle
and a low road that
you can take.

00:19:01.636 --> 00:19:03.116 A:middle
You sort of can go up and down

00:19:03.256 --> 00:19:05.666 A:middle
as you're progressing
through the level.

00:19:05.996 --> 00:19:09.366 A:middle
But the game really
encourages you to go back

00:19:09.476 --> 00:19:11.716 A:middle
and play the levels
over and over again.

00:19:11.716 --> 00:19:14.046 A:middle
Maybe the first time through
you're going for time.

00:19:14.326 --> 00:19:16.846 A:middle
But then it unlocks
different objectives

00:19:17.226 --> 00:19:20.846 A:middle
to collect all the crystals or
to go entirely through the level

00:19:20.886 --> 00:19:24.106 A:middle
without switching your color,
which imagine how difficult

00:19:24.106 --> 00:19:26.576 A:middle
that would be on a level
like the one we just saw.

00:19:26.716 --> 00:19:30.636 A:middle
And the third thing about this
game is that this is a game

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:32.346 A:middle
that is great on
your iPhone and iPad,

00:19:32.396 --> 00:19:35.446 A:middle
but it is awesome
on your Apple TV.

00:19:35.656 --> 00:19:38.196 A:middle
We love how this plays
with the Siri Remote.

00:19:38.196 --> 00:19:39.686 A:middle
That's what Mark is using now.

00:19:39.916 --> 00:19:42.416 A:middle
It also plays great
with an MFi controller.

00:19:43.026 --> 00:19:45.776 A:middle
And it's just one of these
games that is just fantastic

00:19:45.966 --> 00:19:49.576 A:middle
when you see it on the big
screen in your living room.

00:19:49.876 --> 00:19:51.126 A:middle
So that's Chameleon Run.

00:19:51.206 --> 00:19:52.466 A:middle
It supports Game Center.

00:19:52.616 --> 00:19:55.856 A:middle
It's localized in 8 languages,
and it's a premium title.

00:19:56.336 --> 00:19:57.706 A:middle
Just pay once and play.

00:19:58.026 --> 00:19:59.276 A:middle

00:20:14.976 --> 00:20:15.956 A:middle

Auxy Music Creation is an
audio creation app for iPad.

00:20:44.276 --> 00:20:46.086 A:middle
And the Auxy team realized

00:20:46.086 --> 00:20:49.376 A:middle
that electronic music was going
mainstream, and so they sat down

00:20:49.376 --> 00:20:53.056 A:middle
and started to develop this app
that allowed electronic fans

00:20:53.416 --> 00:20:56.966 A:middle
to create some of their own
tracks on an iOS device.

00:20:57.516 --> 00:20:59.586 A:middle
And this is a super
compelling app

with a clean minimalist style.

00:21:02.716 --> 00:21:07.696 A:middle
And honestly inside of this
app, it's almost impossible

00:21:07.696 --> 00:21:10.086 A:middle
to create something that
doesn't sound great.

00:21:10.526 --> 00:21:12.996 A:middle
No matter what you tap
on, you get great results.

00:21:13.436 --> 00:21:17.226 A:middle
So I'd like to ask Michael
again to show us this app.

00:21:17.946 --> 00:21:18.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you, John.

00:21:19.066 --> 00:21:20.606 A:middle
So the first thing
that we really loved

00:21:20.606 --> 00:21:24.046 A:middle
about Auxy was the really subtle
and unobtrusive onboarding.

00:21:24.396 --> 00:21:25.936 A:middle
Now I'm not locked
out from the app.

00:21:25.936 --> 00:21:27.996 A:middle
I can go anywhere I want,
but we'll follow the trail

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:28.846 A:middle
and see where it leads us.

00:21:29.236 --> 00:21:31.176 A:middle
So I'll double-tap to start
creating my first loops

00:21:31.176 --> 00:21:33.856 A:middle
and drums.

00:21:33.856 --> 00:21:36.436 A:middle
I'll start with some bass drum.

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.786 A:middle
That's great.

00:21:38.786 --> 00:21:40.516 A:middle
So now it told me that
I can move some notes

00:21:40.516 --> 00:21:43.056 A:middle
around by dragging,
which is really handy

00:21:43.086 --> 00:21:45.256 A:middle
because I just missed that one.

00:21:45.696 --> 00:21:48.556 A:middle
So we'll do some high hat.

00:21:48.556 --> 00:21:52.396 A:middle
And notice how quick and
how performant the UI is.

00:21:52.396 --> 00:21:53.046 A:middle
It's really cool.

00:21:53.196 --> 00:21:56.576 A:middle
OK, I'm going to add some
tom-toms on the off beats.

00:21:58.166 --> 00:22:00.646 A:middle
That actually sounds more like
a kettle drum than a tom-tom,

That actually sounds more like
a kettle drum than a tom-tom,

00:22:01.126 --> 00:22:04.426 A:middle
and that's great because the
onboarding is telling me how

00:22:04.426 --> 00:22:05.176 A:middle
to change my kit.

00:22:05.326 --> 00:22:06.906 A:middle
So let's see if I can find
something a little hipper.

00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:09.856 A:middle
Not that. Not that.

00:22:10.376 --> 00:22:12.776 A:middle
70's disco -- that's
what I'm looking for.

00:22:13.046 --> 00:22:16.626 A:middle
OK. So now what do we
need for 70's disco?

00:22:16.626 --> 00:22:18.006 A:middle
We need some disco base, right?

00:22:18.126 --> 00:22:23.346 A:middle
So let's add another loop.

00:22:23.346 --> 00:22:28.546 A:middle
Great. So the UI is really
responsive because they built

00:22:28.546 --> 00:22:31.056 A:middle
on top of UIKit, and that
is built on top of Metal.

00:22:31.176 --> 00:22:32.676 A:middle
They also went ahead

00:22:32.676 --> 00:22:34.646 A:middle
and implemented Grand
Central Dispatch.

00:22:34.646 --> 00:22:35.796 A:middle

with the performance.

have a lot of character.

to change the character

00:24:41.406 --> 00:24:42.016 A:middle

00:24:42.016 --> 00:24:42.496 A:middle
Thank you.

00:24:42.496 --> 00:24:45.176 A:middle
I was just talking for a moment
here how big the team is,

00:24:45.176 --> 00:24:47.806 A:middle
and it's three people
that created this.

00:24:47.806 --> 00:24:49.816 A:middle
So here's an app --
Auxy Music Creation.

00:24:50.006 --> 00:24:53.216 A:middle
More than 4,000 5-star
reviews on the App Store,

00:24:53.326 --> 00:24:55.866 A:middle
and it's exclusive to iPad.

00:24:56.736 --> 00:24:58.856 A:middle
All right, our fourth
winner is an app

00:24:59.096 --> 00:25:01.266 A:middle
that helps you to
form good habits.

Good job.

00:25:21.646 --> 00:25:21.826 A:middle

00:25:21.826 --> 00:25:21.893 A:middle

[ Music ]

00:25:32.046 --> 00:25:33.956 A:middle
So, Streaks is a to-do list

00:25:33.956 --> 00:25:36.716 A:middle
that helps you form good
habits and change behavior.

00:25:37.406 --> 00:25:40.046 A:middle
And Streaks has a simple
and straightforward UI,

00:25:40.046 --> 00:25:43.456 A:middle
and it's got an excellent
implementation on Apple Watch --

00:25:43.916 --> 00:25:47.656 A:middle
probably the best Apple
Watch app available today.

00:25:48.086 --> 00:25:50.096 A:middle
And we'd like to show
you Streaks right now.

00:25:50.746 --> 00:25:50.966 A:middle
TC?

00:25:50.966 --> 00:25:52.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, John.

00:25:52.456 --> 00:25:56.176 A:middle
So trying to form good
habits is difficult.

00:25:56.806 --> 00:25:59.506 A:middle
The last thing you want is
an app that is complicated

00:25:59.506 --> 00:26:01.996 A:middle
to set up, uninspiring to use,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.506 --> 00:26:01.996 A:middle
to set up, uninspiring to use,

00:26:02.216 --> 00:26:05.686 A:middle
and pretty much itself a
reason for procrastination.

00:26:07.136 --> 00:26:10.766 A:middle
So here are five of
the possible six tasks

00:26:10.766 --> 00:26:11.886 A:middle
that I've set up for myself.

00:26:11.886 --> 00:26:15.026 A:middle
And you can see on the top
right "Practice cello".

00:26:15.416 --> 00:26:18.476 A:middle
So I miss playing the
cello professionally,

00:26:18.956 --> 00:26:20.606 A:middle
but I just haven't
been practicing.

00:26:21.306 --> 00:26:25.526 A:middle
I'm using Streaks to help get me
back to it, to help me remember

00:26:25.526 --> 00:26:29.116 A:middle
to practice regularly because
I have a concert coming up.

00:26:29.496 --> 00:26:30.976 A:middle
And I've been saying
that for a few years now.

00:26:31.071 --> 00:26:33.071 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:26:33.126 --> 00:26:39.016 A:middle
So to see how I've been doing,
I can just tap on the Task icon

00:26:39.016 --> 00:26:40.906 A:middle
for the calendar view here.

00:26:41.246 --> 00:26:43.376 A:middle
I can also peak and pop onto it.

00:26:43.586 --> 00:26:45.676 A:middle
And you can see June
was pretty good.

00:26:45.676 --> 00:26:50.136 A:middle
But if I was to reveal to
you May -- not so good.

00:26:50.366 --> 00:26:52.876 A:middle
So the crosses is where,
for whatever reason,

00:26:52.876 --> 00:26:54.256 A:middle
I've decided not to practice.

00:26:55.276 --> 00:26:56.936 A:middle
Coming back here
and tapping again,

00:26:56.936 --> 00:26:59.486 A:middle
this is a summary
of how I've done.

00:26:59.486 --> 00:27:01.526 A:middle

I'm currently

And you can see that
I'm currently

00:27:01.526 --> 00:27:03.416 A:middle
on a streak of 15 days.

00:27:04.816 --> 00:27:06.176 A:middle
Now we're back here.

00:27:06.776 --> 00:27:09.956 A:middle
To mark a task complete,
all I do is to tap and hold.

00:27:09.956 --> 00:27:11.066 A:middle
And there you go.

00:27:11.066 --> 00:27:13.046 A:middle
It's like I've just finished
practicing for today.

00:27:14.036 --> 00:27:15.326 A:middle
Now when I was outside earlier,

00:27:15.326 --> 00:27:21.336 A:middle
I was reading the iOS 10
API disk documentation.

00:27:21.516 --> 00:27:23.486 A:middle
So I'm going to go and check

00:27:23.486 --> 00:27:25.486 A:middle
"Read the book" as
complete as well.

00:27:26.586 --> 00:27:28.966 A:middle
Now Streaks is also
on Apple Watch.

00:27:29.406 --> 00:27:32.546 A:middle
And it has Watch complications
right onto your Watch face,

00:27:32.926 --> 00:27:35.226 A:middle
including one that is
really cleverly designed.

00:27:35.226 --> 00:27:38.756 A:middle
It's based on a dotted
design which looks just

00:27:38.756 --> 00:27:42.366 A:middle
like the iPhone app so that
you can tell from just looking

00:27:42.366 --> 00:27:43.636 A:middle
at how the dots are arranged

00:27:44.006 --> 00:27:46.106 A:middle
and which ones are
lit how you're doing

00:27:46.106 --> 00:27:47.606 A:middle
with your task for that day.

00:27:48.806 --> 00:27:53.426 A:middle
Streaks uses Watch connectivity
extensively, so my Apple Watch

00:27:53.426 --> 00:27:55.276 A:middle
and iPhone are always in sync.

00:27:55.276 --> 00:28:01.756 A:middle
Now Streaks is also considerate,
and I'll show you what I mean,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:55.276 --> 00:28:01.756 A:middle
Now Streaks is also considerate,
and I'll show you what I mean,

00:28:01.756 --> 00:28:05.316 A:middle
especially in the way it
handles notifications.

00:28:06.516 --> 00:28:13.096 A:middle
For instance, when it comes
to automatic time and my cat,

00:28:14.096 --> 00:28:17.766 A:middle
Auzuki, Streaks knows that
I play with her every day

00:28:17.766 --> 00:28:19.416 A:middle
when I come home from
work immediately,

00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:21.036 A:middle
otherwise she gets quite cranky.

00:28:21.036 --> 00:28:22.916 A:middle
And nobody wants a cranky cat.

00:28:23.606 --> 00:28:27.966 A:middle
So it knows to remind me
at the same time each day

00:28:27.966 --> 00:28:31.116 A:middle
but 30 minutes in advance of
that so that I can continue

00:28:31.116 --> 00:28:32.716 A:middle
that streak and have
a happy cat.

00:28:32.826 --> 00:28:33.536 A:middle
All right?

00:28:33.986 --> 00:28:37.596 A:middle
And it also looks at
HealthKit to try and figure

00:28:37.596 --> 00:28:39.866 A:middle
out when it is I
typically go to bed

00:28:39.866 --> 00:28:44.476 A:middle
so that it doesn't send me a
reminder too late into my day.

00:28:46.066 --> 00:28:48.076 A:middle
For when things are
going really well,

00:28:48.496 --> 00:28:50.176 A:middle
you get encouragement as well.

00:28:50.176 --> 00:28:53.846 A:middle
And in addition to that, Streaks
will suggest perhaps a higher

00:28:53.846 --> 00:28:56.706 A:middle
goal so that you achieve
an overall greater result.

00:28:57.426 --> 00:28:59.926 A:middle
Now, conversely, if you've
been missing a few tasks,

00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:02.886 A:middle
it will suggest an
easier-to-achieve goal


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:02.886 A:middle
it will suggest an
easier-to-achieve goal

00:29:02.886 --> 00:29:03.976 A:middle
so you don't end up giving up.

00:29:10.266 --> 00:29:14.026 A:middle
OK, so Streaks is
a 5-star rated app.

00:29:14.026 --> 00:29:16.346 A:middle
It's exclusive to iOS and Watch,

00:29:17.136 --> 00:29:19.266 A:middle
and it was developed
using Swift.

00:29:20.386 --> 00:29:22.896 A:middle
Bad habits form automatically.

00:29:23.236 --> 00:29:25.766 A:middle
Streaks helps us come
up with good ones.

00:29:26.146 --> 00:29:27.496 A:middle
I'm more confident than ever

00:29:27.496 --> 00:29:29.926 A:middle
that I'll be playing my
cello soon in a concert,

00:29:29.926 --> 00:29:33.196 A:middle
or to read many books, and
have a really happy cat.

So Lara Croft Go
captures the spirit

of this classic franchise,
and then reimagines it

with a small studio
within their organization

of creating something

00:31:12.826 --> 00:31:17.336 A:middle
So Lara Croft Go is a turn-based
puzzle adventure game that's set

00:31:17.336 --> 00:31:20.486 A:middle
in the ruins of an
ancient civilization.

00:31:20.486 --> 00:31:24.246 A:middle
And what we loved about this
game is how it took so many

00:31:24.246 --> 00:31:26.786 A:middle
of the elements of the
Lara Croft franchise --

00:31:26.946 --> 00:31:31.316 A:middle
things like the archeological
exploration, and the adventure,

00:31:31.316 --> 00:31:35.186 A:middle
and solving puzzles and avoiding
traps, and Lara herself --

00:31:35.326 --> 00:31:38.196 A:middle
and reimagined all those things

00:31:38.196 --> 00:31:41.706 A:middle
into a puzzle game
that's perfect for mobile

00:31:41.706 --> 00:31:44.146 A:middle
and beautifully designed
for touch.

00:31:44.376 --> 00:31:45.866 A:middle
So I'd like to show you it here.

00:31:46.166 --> 00:31:49.326 A:middle
I'm coming into a level
here that's onboarding me

00:31:49.326 --> 00:31:51.016 A:middle
into a new game mechanic
that has to do

00:31:51.016 --> 00:31:52.566 A:middle
with these rolling boulders.

00:31:52.936 --> 00:31:54.516 A:middle
But actually, before
I even do that,

00:31:54.566 --> 00:31:56.556 A:middle
just take this in for a moment.

00:31:56.556 --> 00:31:59.906 A:middle
I mean, check out the
stylized rendering.

I hope you can all hear the

00:32:02.506 --> 00:32:03.656 A:middle
It's just beautiful.

00:32:03.946 --> 00:32:07.076 A:middle
And we really love
things like the attention

00:32:07.116 --> 00:32:08.596 A:middle
to detail in the levels.

00:32:08.596 --> 00:32:11.406 A:middle
And it has a really
unobtrusive UI.

00:32:11.866 --> 00:32:16.046 A:middle
There's no virtual joypad
here to move Lara around.

00:32:16.046 --> 00:32:20.106 A:middle
To move Lara to the next space,
I just swipe and she moves.

00:32:20.246 --> 00:32:22.976 A:middle
But, OK, so let's start
looking through this level here.

00:32:23.276 --> 00:32:25.256 A:middle
Obviously there's this
boulder, and I have a feeling

00:32:25.256 --> 00:32:27.556 A:middle
that if I step on
the trap -- yeah.

00:32:27.796 --> 00:32:31.936 A:middle
OK. So, mental note, don't
step under falling boulders.

00:32:32.226 --> 00:32:35.696 A:middle
But we can put that knowledge
to work a little bit later.

00:32:35.826 --> 00:32:38.796 A:middle
Isn't it cool how she kind
of hangs off the ledge there?

00:32:39.346 --> 00:32:40.866 A:middle
All right, but I'm going
forward a little further here.

00:32:40.866 --> 00:32:41.696 A:middle
Here's another one.

00:32:41.746 --> 00:32:45.496 A:middle
I'm going to get it going,
but then I'll take a step back

00:32:45.496 --> 00:32:46.696 A:middle
and let it roll past me.

00:32:47.566 --> 00:32:48.656 A:middle
OK, so I'm safe.

00:32:49.336 --> 00:32:51.796 A:middle
And I come down now into
the next part of the stage.

00:32:52.086 --> 00:32:53.096 A:middle
All right.

00:32:53.446 --> 00:32:55.636 A:middle

And this next one wakes up.

00:33:10.086 --> 00:33:13.506 A:middle
OK, now the game mechanic here
is that as I move once space,

00:33:13.506 --> 00:33:14.986 A:middle
the lizard will move one space.

00:33:15.296 --> 00:33:18.696 A:middle

whatever path I take.

up the wall here

him right where I want him.

dispatch the snake.

00:33:33.776 --> 00:33:35.166 A:middle

One of the reasons
we chose this app is

because it leveraged the
performance of iPad Pro.

00:37:07.886 --> 00:37:09.326 A:middle
With the new CPU and GPU,

exploring content in this app,

to create and share content.

if I was a teacher,

could record a common procedure

00:40:55.076 --> 00:40:55.976 A:middle

[ Laughter ]

00:41:00.526 --> 00:41:05.436 A:middle
Oh, man. OK, this was a
lot easier in rehearsals

00:41:05.436 --> 00:41:07.506 A:middle
when I didn't have
5,000 people watching.

00:41:08.366 --> 00:41:11.726 A:middle
All right, so I'm going to go
to one of the easier levels.

00:41:12.066 --> 00:41:14.066 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:41:14.116 --> 00:41:19.356 A:middle
And just to show you guys
this, too, INKS offers hours

00:41:19.356 --> 00:41:23.966 A:middle
of gameplay for more beginner
players -- of which I am not.

00:41:25.196 --> 00:41:27.266 A:middle
All right, let's try this.

00:41:27.626 --> 00:41:30.666 A:middle
Bam! That's how I do!

00:41:31.516 --> 00:41:33.546 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:41:34.046 --> 00:41:34.886 A:middle
All right.

00:41:35.386 --> 00:41:37.976 A:middle
So what I want to show you
guys is some of the levels

00:41:37.976 --> 00:41:40.646 A:middle
that really demonstrate
the highly realistic INKS

00:41:40.646 --> 00:41:41.896 A:middle
that I was talking
about earlier.

00:41:42.586 --> 00:41:44.976 A:middle
So there's that big color
swatch in the center.

00:41:45.096 --> 00:41:49.126 A:middle
And each time you hit one, it
explodes and reacts to force

00:41:49.126 --> 00:41:50.776 A:middle
and angle in its own unique way.

00:41:51.036 --> 00:41:53.986 A:middle
And check out how the
colors continue to blend

00:41:53.986 --> 00:41:56.176 A:middle
into each other and
darken as they go.

00:41:56.176 --> 00:41:59.506 A:middle
The team spent a lot of
time studying water colors,

00:41:59.506 --> 00:42:01.976 A:middle
the physics of it, the
dynamics, how it dries

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:59.506 --> 00:42:01.976 A:middle
the physics of it, the
dynamics, how it dries

00:42:02.036 --> 00:42:03.996 A:middle
into the paper and blends.

00:42:03.996 --> 00:42:05.236 A:middle
It's really gorgeous.

00:42:05.236 --> 00:42:07.746 A:middle
And I'll show you just
one more level here

00:42:08.816 --> 00:42:10.796 A:middle
that just shows off how,

00:42:11.056 --> 00:42:13.836 A:middle
even though this is a
completely new take on pinball,

00:42:13.836 --> 00:42:17.106 A:middle
they still respected a lot of
the sound effects, and the feel

00:42:17.106 --> 00:42:19.536 A:middle
of the bumpers, and habitrails,

00:42:19.536 --> 00:42:21.366 A:middle
and drop targets,
and the flippers.

00:42:21.366 --> 00:42:23.826 A:middle
I mean, it's really,
really amazing.

00:42:23.826 --> 00:42:26.306 A:middle
And I'm probably not going to
have time to finish this one.

00:42:26.366 --> 00:42:27.916 A:middle
I'll just let it go
down the drain there.

00:42:28.376 --> 00:42:31.206 A:middle
But I think this really
demonstrates how you can take a

00:42:31.206 --> 00:42:33.556 A:middle
traditional game mechanic
and with enough thought,

00:42:33.836 --> 00:42:36.216 A:middle
attention to detail and
care, create something

00:42:36.216 --> 00:42:37.936 A:middle
which is completely
fresh and unique.

00:42:38.356 --> 00:42:38.976 A:middle
Brilliant job.

00:42:38.976 --> 00:42:39.816 A:middle

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Mike.

00:42:46.616 --> 00:42:49.126 A:middle
So it's obvious that we picked
this game as a winner tonight

00:42:49.286 --> 00:42:51.396 A:middle
because it's really
well-designed.

00:42:51.396 --> 00:42:53.236 A:middle
It's rich and unique.

00:42:53.236 --> 00:42:54.746 A:middle
It's available in
five languages,

00:42:54.746 --> 00:42:56.326 A:middle
and it's exclusive to iOS.

00:42:56.486 --> 00:42:59.676 A:middle
And it's also really
interesting to note that a lot

00:42:59.676 --> 00:43:03.876 A:middle
of the conceptualization and the
artistry was done on an iPad Pro


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:59.676 --> 00:43:03.876 A:middle
of the conceptualization and the
artistry was done on an iPad Pro

00:43:03.876 --> 00:43:06.366 A:middle
with Apple Pencil by the team.

00:43:06.416 --> 00:43:09.466 A:middle
So they used some other tools,
too, to come up with this.

00:43:10.266 --> 00:43:11.036 A:middle
So that's INKS.

and great HD videos that
look awesome on Apple TV.

it's thoughtful,

00:43:59.416 --> 00:44:01.996 A:middle
and in so many ways
they took little things

and in so many ways
they took little things

00:44:01.996 --> 00:44:03.266 A:middle
and considered them deeply.

00:44:03.436 --> 00:44:06.146 A:middle
And it's really great
on Apple TV.

00:44:06.146 --> 00:44:08.526 A:middle
In fact, we like this app so
much that we took it with us

00:44:08.526 --> 00:44:12.896 A:middle
on the roadshow this fall --
the Apple TV Tech Talks --

00:44:12.896 --> 00:44:15.256 A:middle
and we used it as one
of the reference apps

00:44:15.256 --> 00:44:16.556 A:middle
in our design sessions.

00:44:17.096 --> 00:44:19.726 A:middle
And we'd like to
show it to you now.

00:44:19.776 --> 00:44:20.016 A:middle
So, TC?

00:44:20.366 --> 00:44:21.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks again, John.

00:44:22.016 --> 00:44:24.536 A:middle
Zova is a fitness app
that provides short,

00:44:24.536 --> 00:44:26.466 A:middle
achievable, daily exercises.

00:44:26.986 --> 00:44:29.306 A:middle
Now this team here
they've been early adopters

00:44:29.306 --> 00:44:33.526 A:middle
of Apple technologies from day
1 with their initial release

00:44:33.526 --> 00:44:35.416 A:middle
of the app and HealthKit
support,

00:44:35.996 --> 00:44:40.506 A:middle
to then Apple Watch support, and
most recently Apple TV support.

00:44:40.506 --> 00:44:42.936 A:middle
But they don't just
do it gratuitously.

00:44:43.836 --> 00:44:47.406 A:middle
They only deliver on
unique experiences conducive

00:44:47.446 --> 00:44:49.826 A:middle
to each platform
that feels natural

00:44:50.566 --> 00:44:52.866 A:middle
as if it always meant
to be that.

00:44:53.246 --> 00:44:56.556 A:middle
And today, we'd like to
talk about the Apple TV app.

00:44:57.116 --> 00:45:01.866 A:middle
So with Apple TV, they didn't
just upsize the content.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:57.116 --> 00:45:01.866 A:middle
So with Apple TV, they didn't
just upsize the content.

00:45:02.696 --> 00:45:06.046 A:middle
They took the Apple TV
concept to heart and thought

00:45:06.046 --> 00:45:08.806 A:middle
about the whole medium of TV.

00:45:09.936 --> 00:45:11.576 A:middle
TV is a major part of our lives.

00:45:12.086 --> 00:45:16.396 A:middle
It's when we gather together to
enjoy content and experiences.

00:45:17.666 --> 00:45:21.466 A:middle
Now workout apps don't have to
be lonesome activities anymore.

00:45:22.006 --> 00:45:25.006 A:middle
With the communal experiences
afforded by Apple TV,

00:45:25.246 --> 00:45:28.846 A:middle
Zova had to think about the kind
of content that they can create.

00:45:29.486 --> 00:45:32.416 A:middle
This collection here called
Move Together is where you team

00:45:32.416 --> 00:45:35.136 A:middle
up with your friend and
actually workout together

00:45:35.306 --> 00:45:37.206 A:middle
and get fit together.

00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:42.686 A:middle
But Zova didn't just stop
at rethinking content.

00:45:43.466 --> 00:45:46.156 A:middle
They also wanted to take full
advantage of the Siri Remote.

00:45:46.786 --> 00:45:49.486 A:middle
As you will see me
navigating through this, it is,

00:45:49.486 --> 00:45:51.866 A:middle
as you would expect, very
easy to find content.

00:45:53.576 --> 00:45:56.346 A:middle
And focusing on elements
is easy, too.

00:45:56.346 --> 00:45:58.616 A:middle
Let's go into this workout here.

00:45:59.336 --> 00:46:02.146 A:middle
So, here, you get
a brief description


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:59.336 --> 00:46:02.146 A:middle
So, here, you get
a brief description

00:46:02.146 --> 00:46:03.586 A:middle
of what this workout is about.

00:46:03.586 --> 00:46:06.146 A:middle
And also, if you have
a look at the bottom,

00:46:06.256 --> 00:46:07.776 A:middle
these are video previews

00:46:08.026 --> 00:46:10.616 A:middle
of exactly what the
exercises entail.

00:46:11.526 --> 00:46:14.286 A:middle
That way, you know what
you're really in for.

00:46:14.286 --> 00:46:16.666 A:middle
But where the implementation
of Siri Remote really comes

00:46:16.666 --> 00:46:19.486 A:middle
into its own is when you're
actually inside of a workout.

00:46:19.826 --> 00:46:20.856 A:middle
So let's try one of these.

00:46:28.436 --> 00:46:31.226 A:middle
Each workout starts with a
preview, so you're reminded

00:46:31.226 --> 00:46:32.906 A:middle
of exactly what the exercise is.

00:46:40.506 --> 00:46:43.196 A:middle
Now I've just pressed the
Pause button, and it responds

00:46:43.196 --> 00:46:45.546 A:middle
as you would expect because
you will get interrupted

00:46:45.546 --> 00:46:46.556 A:middle
when you're trying to exercise.

00:46:46.556 --> 00:46:47.486 A:middle
That's just the way it is.

00:46:48.046 --> 00:46:50.476 A:middle
When you resume the pause,
it will give you a countdown

00:46:50.476 --> 00:46:52.676 A:middle
so that you can actually
ready yourself instead

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:54.216 A:middle
of just jumping straight
into it.

00:46:55.146 --> 00:46:58.456 A:middle
But where it gets really
interesting is I'm now pressing

00:46:58.456 --> 00:47:02.026 A:middle
and holding onto the Pause
button, and instead I'm provided


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:58.456 --> 00:47:02.026 A:middle
and holding onto the Pause
button, and instead I'm provided

00:47:02.026 --> 00:47:05.626 A:middle
with a freeze frame so that
I can look more closely

00:47:05.626 --> 00:47:06.996 A:middle
at the details on the screen --

00:47:07.266 --> 00:47:10.566 A:middle
perhaps the exact
posture of the instructor.

00:47:11.116 --> 00:47:14.326 A:middle
Now this is possible and is
beyond the standard controls

00:47:14.326 --> 00:47:18.046 A:middle
because Zova has implemented
a custom AVPlayerLayer.

00:47:20.046 --> 00:47:22.396 A:middle
Similarly, if I was
to swipe left,

00:47:22.626 --> 00:47:25.616 A:middle
I can restart an
exercise very quickly.

00:47:26.196 --> 00:47:32.376 A:middle
Or, if I was to swipe
to the right,

00:47:32.376 --> 00:47:33.976 A:middle
you can see I can easily skip.

00:47:41.046 --> 00:47:43.046 A:middle
Now you may have noticed
references earlier

00:47:43.046 --> 00:47:43.836 A:middle
to Apple Watch.

00:47:44.536 --> 00:47:47.216 A:middle
This is really neat.

00:47:47.426 --> 00:47:49.946 A:middle
What's happening here is
it's taking my heartrate

00:47:49.946 --> 00:47:50.626 A:middle
from my Watch.

00:47:50.956 --> 00:47:55.746 A:middle
And through HealthKit and
my iPhone, it is overlaying

00:47:55.746 --> 00:47:57.846 A:middle
that onto the live
video stream here.

00:47:57.846 --> 00:47:59.376 A:middle

you're looking at.

Let's move along then.

00:48:07.506 --> 00:48:11.586 A:middle
At the end of each workout, you
have an opportunity to, I guess,

00:48:11.586 --> 00:48:13.816 A:middle
log your feedback as
to how you've done.

00:48:14.196 --> 00:48:16.346 A:middle
And this is a really fun
use of the Siri Remote.

00:48:16.346 --> 00:48:19.896 A:middle
You can either give it a big
thumbs-up for it has gone well,

00:48:20.196 --> 00:48:21.776 A:middle
or if it's gone less well --

00:48:21.776 --> 00:48:27.406 A:middle
and in my case, I tend to
quiver my lips a little, too.

00:48:27.406 --> 00:48:27.976 A:middle

00:49:35.046 --> 00:49:37.646 A:middle
So Ulysses is a powerful
text editor for writers

00:49:37.646 --> 00:49:40.286 A:middle
of all kinds -- journalists,
bloggers, you name it.

00:49:40.336 --> 00:49:44.116 A:middle
And it's designed specifically
to cover all aspects

00:49:44.116 --> 00:49:45.286 A:middle
of the writing process.

00:49:45.286 --> 00:49:47.376 A:middle
And we picked it as a winner

00:49:47.376 --> 00:49:49.736 A:middle
because it's a tool
that's optimized

00:49:49.736 --> 00:49:51.786 A:middle
for writing without distraction.

00:49:52.106 --> 00:49:54.936 A:middle
The entire UI of the
operating system goes away

00:49:54.936 --> 00:49:57.116 A:middle
and you're just working
with your words.

00:49:57.716 --> 00:50:00.336 A:middle
And the execution of
this app is so great.

00:49:57.716 --> 00:50:00.336 A:middle
And the execution of
this app is so great.

00:50:00.336 --> 00:50:03.076 A:middle
It allows you to work
on any of our devices.

00:50:03.456 --> 00:50:06.436 A:middle
You can choose to start on
the Mac, then move to iPad,

00:50:06.856 --> 00:50:09.016 A:middle
then move to iPhone,
and move back.

00:50:09.016 --> 00:50:11.596 A:middle
And you get that
distraction-free experience

00:50:11.656 --> 00:50:13.356 A:middle
on any of those devices.

00:50:13.956 --> 00:50:16.626 A:middle
And to show this app to you, I'd
like to turn it over to Michael.

00:50:17.556 --> 00:50:18.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, John.

00:50:18.676 --> 00:50:20.586 A:middle
So Ulysses is a focused

00:50:20.586 --> 00:50:22.806 A:middle
and distraction-free
writing environment.

00:50:23.396 --> 00:50:26.416 A:middle
It has the power of
classic word processers

00:50:26.416 --> 00:50:29.176 A:middle
with flexible organization
and management tools.

00:50:29.176 --> 00:50:32.926 A:middle
Now it's a super clean writing
experience and it has features

00:50:32.926 --> 00:50:34.316 A:middle
to help you through the task.

00:50:34.756 --> 00:50:36.066 A:middle
So the first thing, for example,

00:50:36.476 --> 00:50:38.836 A:middle
is I can highlight
the current line.

00:50:38.836 --> 00:50:40.596 A:middle
That should look familiar.

00:50:41.266 --> 00:50:44.136 A:middle
We can also show
paragraph numbers.

00:50:45.266 --> 00:50:47.616 A:middle
Now Ulysses is based
on Markdown.

00:50:48.066 --> 00:50:49.236 A:middle
And what Markdown is --

00:50:49.796 --> 00:50:52.236 A:middle
it's a markup language
that uses plain text

00:50:52.236 --> 00:50:54.196 A:middle
and special characters
to set semantics.

00:50:54.476 --> 00:50:57.066 A:middle
So, for example, here you
can see that in this copy

00:50:57.066 --> 00:50:59.006 A:middle
of the Apple TV human
interface guidelines

00:50:59.796 --> 00:51:02.186 A:middle
that navigation has
two hash marks,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:59.796 --> 00:51:02.186 A:middle
that navigation has
two hash marks,

00:51:02.186 --> 00:51:03.956 A:middle
and that is a second-level
header.

00:51:04.406 --> 00:51:08.486 A:middle
By the way, this tear-off menu
is from their use of AppKit.

00:51:09.156 --> 00:51:13.056 A:middle
Now Ulysses also presents images
and URLs in a user-friendly

00:51:13.056 --> 00:51:14.996 A:middle
and vey distraction-free way.

00:51:16.636 --> 00:51:19.536 A:middle
Now Ulysses is really
customizable.

00:51:19.536 --> 00:51:21.636 A:middle
For me, for example, I
like working at night.

00:51:21.636 --> 00:51:24.926 A:middle
I get creative after
dark, so I like Dark Mode.

00:51:25.166 --> 00:51:26.726 A:middle
If Dark Mode doesn't
work for you,

00:51:27.076 --> 00:51:30.196 A:middle
there are customizable themes,
or you can download themes

00:51:30.196 --> 00:51:31.686 A:middle
from the Ulysses User Community.

00:51:32.206 --> 00:51:34.696 A:middle
Now Markdown is an open
standard, so they also ship

00:51:34.736 --> 00:51:36.656 A:middle
with a number of different
markdown definitions,

00:51:36.656 --> 00:51:38.196 A:middle
or you can create your own.

00:51:38.486 --> 00:51:40.046 A:middle
Both custom markdown definitions

00:51:40.126 --> 00:51:43.926 A:middle
and custom themes are all
synchronized using iCloud.

00:51:45.256 --> 00:51:51.956 A:middle
OK. Now this is a modern,
single-window, multicolumn app.

00:51:52.366 --> 00:51:54.066 A:middle
So if you take a look all
the way on the left side,

00:51:54.066 --> 00:51:55.286 A:middle
that's my library column.

00:51:55.286 --> 00:51:56.266 A:middle
And in my library column,

00:51:56.266 --> 00:51:57.946 A:middle
that's where I manage
all of my writing.

00:51:58.316 --> 00:52:02.196 A:middle
For example, here I have a
group of public domain books.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:51:58.316 --> 00:52:02.196 A:middle
For example, here I have a
group of public domain books.

00:52:02.196 --> 00:52:04.466 A:middle
I also have filters.

00:52:04.466 --> 00:52:07.316 A:middle
Now a filter is sort
of a persistent search.

00:52:07.406 --> 00:52:09.796 A:middle
So here, for example, I'm
searching for the word "Ishmael"

00:52:09.796 --> 00:52:10.776 A:middle
or the name "Ishmael".

00:52:11.136 --> 00:52:13.616 A:middle
And all of the occurrences
come up, most of them

00:52:13.616 --> 00:52:14.646 A:middle
from the book "Moby Dick".

00:52:14.646 --> 00:52:16.426 A:middle
And I can also change the icon

00:52:16.426 --> 00:52:17.836 A:middle
to something a little
bit more appropriate.

00:52:18.696 --> 00:52:20.826 A:middle
I can also do ad hoc searches.

00:52:21.566 --> 00:52:25.916 A:middle
So, for example, I know that
there is a single occurrence

00:52:25.916 --> 00:52:27.756 A:middle
of the word "galleon"
in all of these books.

00:52:27.756 --> 00:52:28.416 A:middle
And if I take a look

00:52:28.416 --> 00:52:31.266 A:middle
at the search base using
the statistics feature,

00:52:31.546 --> 00:52:35.006 A:middle
I can see that I just searched
through about 1.3 million words,

00:52:35.356 --> 00:52:36.946 A:middle
most of those written
by James Joyce.

00:52:37.326 --> 00:52:39.916 A:middle
And that's thanks to their
implementation of Spotlight

00:52:39.916 --> 00:52:41.376 A:middle
and Grand Central Dispatch.

00:52:42.216 --> 00:52:44.336 A:middle
Okie dokie.

00:52:45.386 --> 00:52:49.416 A:middle
So let's go back here.

00:52:49.416 --> 00:52:50.686 A:middle
Let's kill this.

00:52:50.686 --> 00:52:52.236 A:middle
Let's go back to
our Apple TV HIG.

00:52:53.016 --> 00:52:55.216 A:middle
All right.

00:52:56.216 --> 00:52:59.616 A:middle
Now Ulysses is
delivery-agnostic,

00:52:59.666 --> 00:53:01.486 A:middle
so it doesn't matter where
you're going to deliver from.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:52:59.666 --> 00:53:01.486 A:middle
so it doesn't matter where
you're going to deliver from.

00:53:01.486 --> 00:53:03.016 A:middle
You can preview in a number

00:53:03.016 --> 00:53:05.676 A:middle
of different formats
powered by TextKit, PDFKit.

00:53:05.676 --> 00:53:08.256 A:middle
It can even publish
directly to Medium.

00:53:08.256 --> 00:53:10.836 A:middle
But one of the things

00:53:10.836 --> 00:53:12.376 A:middle
that they've done is
they've allowed you

00:53:12.376 --> 00:53:14.226 A:middle
to make your own CSS files

00:53:15.916 --> 00:53:18.166 A:middle
to style the preview
exactly the way you need it.

00:53:18.166 --> 00:53:20.306 A:middle
So, for example, here
I have an HTML preview

00:53:20.306 --> 00:53:22.216 A:middle
and I happen to have
an Apple CSS.

00:53:22.216 --> 00:53:30.566 A:middle
And I can apply that
to my preview, like so.

00:53:30.566 --> 00:53:34.076 A:middle
And you can see how the
Apple TV HIG would look

00:53:34.736 --> 00:53:36.646 A:middle
on an Apple website.

00:53:37.596 --> 00:53:38.336 A:middle
All right.

00:53:38.806 --> 00:53:43.636 A:middle
Now as John mentioned, Ulysses
is available on OS X and iOS,

00:53:43.816 --> 00:53:47.506 A:middle
eventually Mac OS I hope.

00:53:47.506 --> 00:53:49.636 A:middle
It implements Handoff.

00:53:49.636 --> 00:53:51.296 A:middle
It's available in 7 languages.

00:53:51.676 --> 00:53:52.786 A:middle
We love this app.

00:53:52.786 --> 00:53:53.996 A:middle
We use this app at Apple.

00:53:54.286 --> 00:53:55.486 A:middle

00:53:55.486 --> 00:53:58.316 A:middle

&gt;&gt; So, as Michael said
-- thank you, Michael.

00:54:07.946 --> 00:54:10.786 A:middle
As Michael said, Ulysses is
a great example of an app

00:54:10.846 --> 00:54:16.586 A:middle
that takes advantage of iOS and
OS X, Handoff, iCloud and more

00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:18.536 A:middle
to deliver an optimized
experience

00:54:18.536 --> 00:54:19.836 A:middle
on each of these platforms.

00:54:20.216 --> 00:54:22.626 A:middle
We talked about this new
opportunity of four platforms,

00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:24.456 A:middle
and this is an app
that does a great job

00:54:24.456 --> 00:54:25.936 A:middle
of heading in that direction.

00:54:26.166 --> 00:54:26.946 A:middle
Congratulations.

00:54:27.506 --> 00:54:30.546 A:middle
All right, our last
winner today is an app

00:54:30.546 --> 00:54:32.376 A:middle
that is incredibly
state-of-the-art

00:54:32.446 --> 00:54:34.506 A:middle
and incredibly accessible.

00:54:35.216 --> 00:54:38.976 A:middle

[ Music ]

00:55:03.096 --> 00:55:04.796 A:middle
All right, so djay Pro is one

00:55:04.796 --> 00:55:09.206 A:middle
of the first professional-grade
apps to fully leverage the audio

00:55:09.206 --> 00:55:11.676 A:middle
and video capabilities
of the new iPad Pro.

00:55:12.166 --> 00:55:15.936 A:middle
And these guys already won an
Apple Design Award in 2011,

00:55:16.226 --> 00:55:18.416 A:middle
but they have done
so much since then

00:55:18.416 --> 00:55:20.356 A:middle
and they continue to innovate.

00:55:20.536 --> 00:55:23.276 A:middle
And they have consistently
stayed in lockstep

00:55:23.336 --> 00:55:25.976 A:middle
with us every time
we released a new OS,

00:55:25.976 --> 00:55:28.506 A:middle
every time there's
some new technology,

00:55:28.736 --> 00:55:32.166 A:middle
and every time there's
a new device to support.

00:55:32.166 --> 00:55:33.086 A:middle
Really impressive.

00:55:33.466 --> 00:55:36.586 A:middle
And we love this app because
it sets new benchmarks

for use of Apple technology,

00:55:40.926 --> 00:55:45.096 A:middle
for multi-device support,

And I'd like to ask Ryan
to show the app off now.

My name is Ryan Dour.

I'm an engineer on the

00:55:54.246 --> 00:55:56.166 A:middle
at Apple, but I'm also a deejay.

00:55:56.506 --> 00:55:58.376 A:middle
All of my life, I've
been visually impaired.

00:55:58.376 --> 00:56:00.156 A:middle
But during high school
and college,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:55:58.376 --> 00:56:00.156 A:middle
But during high school
and college,

00:56:00.156 --> 00:56:02.486 A:middle
I lost most of my
remaining usable vision.

00:56:03.076 --> 00:56:05.166 A:middle
I've always deejayed with
CD players and mixers

00:56:05.196 --> 00:56:07.526 A:middle
because they offer a
hands-on tactile experience.

00:56:08.146 --> 00:56:10.136 A:middle
However, with the rise
of digital deejaying,

00:56:10.136 --> 00:56:11.646 A:middle
I was feeling pretty left out.

00:56:12.676 --> 00:56:15.596 A:middle
About a year ago, I got my
hands on djay Pro for the Mac

00:56:15.596 --> 00:56:17.866 A:middle
and this external deejay
controller and I got back

00:56:17.866 --> 00:56:19.736 A:middle
into it, and it's been
a great time since.

00:56:19.736 --> 00:56:25.816 A:middle
However, djay Pro for iPad
takes accessible deejaying

00:56:25.816 --> 00:56:28.266 A:middle
to a whole new level, and I'd
love to show it to you now.

00:56:29.026 --> 00:56:33.376 A:middle
So, over here, I have an
iPad Pro running djay Pro

00:56:33.576 --> 00:56:34.796 A:middle
and this external mixer.

00:56:34.846 --> 00:56:37.036 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and
throw on my headphones now.

00:56:37.906 --> 00:56:41.206 A:middle
So, here's the thing
that's interesting.

00:56:41.206 --> 00:56:42.746 A:middle
The external deejay
controller acts

00:56:42.746 --> 00:56:44.516 A:middle
as an extension of
the onscreen UI.

00:56:45.526 --> 00:56:48.526 A:middle
And so I can use it
to really create kind

00:56:48.526 --> 00:56:49.856 A:middle
of a pretty cool performance.

00:56:49.916 --> 00:56:53.226 A:middle
Also, you're probably wondering
what of this can I see.

00:56:53.226 --> 00:56:56.426 A:middle
Not much. I pretty much can see
the light coming from the screen

00:56:56.426 --> 00:56:58.406 A:middle
and some of the, you know,
colorful lights coming

00:56:58.406 --> 00:57:00.926 A:middle
from the deejay controller,
but that's about it.

from the deejay controller,
but that's about it.

00:57:00.926 --> 00:57:03.066 A:middle
So knowing that, we're
going to use VoiceOver

00:57:03.066 --> 00:57:04.106 A:middle

00:57:04.106 --> 00:57:10.006 A:middle
Let's go ahead and
get the music started.

00:57:10.296 --> 00:57:12.756 A:middle
OK, so the first thing
I'd like to point out is

00:57:12.756 --> 00:57:13.596 A:middle
that I have access

00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:15.036 A:middle
to information I've
never had before.

00:57:15.036 --> 00:57:16.556 A:middle
For example, the time.

00:57:16.556 --> 00:57:18.266 A:middle
How much time is
left on this track?

00:57:18.266 --> 00:57:21.146 A:middle
Let's find out.

00:57:21.146 --> 00:57:21.936 A:middle
That's perfect.

00:57:21.936 --> 00:57:24.226 A:middle
OK. So I'm the deejay, I'm
supposed to keep the music going

00:57:24.226 --> 00:57:25.746 A:middle
and now I have that
kind of information.

00:57:26.056 --> 00:57:27.946 A:middle
I also can use these
tempo sliders.

00:57:28.236 --> 00:57:33.316 A:middle
For example, if I touch it
right now -- hold on a second.

00:57:34.256 --> 00:57:36.176 A:middle
So we hear it's at a
standard playback speed.

00:57:36.176 --> 00:57:38.296 A:middle
But if I slow it down
using the deejay controller

00:57:38.296 --> 00:57:43.626 A:middle
and I touch it again,

00:57:44.666 --> 00:57:47.456 A:middle
we can hear exactly how far
I slowed that track down.

00:57:47.456 --> 00:57:48.206 A:middle
That's really cool.

00:57:48.686 --> 00:57:51.136 A:middle
I also can use these
multidimensional effects pads.

00:57:51.196 --> 00:57:52.846 A:middle
For example, if I touch
it the first time --

00:57:53.736 --> 00:57:55.806 A:middle
but the second time.

00:58:01.176 --> 00:58:02.176 A:middle
Really cool stuff, right?

00:58:02.246 --> 00:58:06.016 A:middle
So between these effects
pads, this external controller

00:58:06.016 --> 00:58:07.266 A:middle
and all this accessible UI,

00:58:07.266 --> 00:58:08.886 A:middle
I can do a pretty
cool performance.

00:58:08.886 --> 00:58:10.566 A:middle
So I'd like to go ahead
and ask the stage here

00:58:10.566 --> 00:58:13.776 A:middle
to please take VoiceOver
off of the PA systems --

00:58:13.776 --> 00:58:15.566 A:middle
that it's only available
to me and my headphones.

00:58:17.746 --> 00:58:18.746 A:middle
Cool. Thank you very much.

00:58:18.746 --> 00:58:19.916 A:middle
And I'm going to
mix for you now.

00:58:20.296 --> 00:58:20.826 A:middle

&gt;&gt; I've got to tell you --

00:59:26.426 --> 00:59:29.286 A:middle
this is an incredible
custom user interface.

00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:33.196 A:middle
They did not use UIKit
with this interface at all.

00:59:33.196 --> 00:59:35.456 A:middle
They didn't get any of their
accessibility for free.

00:59:35.866 --> 00:59:38.566 A:middle
Considering that,
their implementation

00:59:38.676 --> 00:59:43.046 A:middle
of our accessibility APIs is
nothing less than spectacular.

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:44.796 A:middle
So I want to let everybody know,

00:59:44.796 --> 00:59:46.956 A:middle
and especially all the
visually-impaired deejays

00:59:46.956 --> 00:59:50.946 A:middle
out there, this app has
really enriched my life.

00:59:50.946 --> 00:59:53.986 A:middle
So I absolutely cannot
wait to see what the rest

00:59:53.986 --> 00:59:55.796 A:middle
of you developers
make accessible next!

00:59:55.796 --> 00:59:57.576 A:middle

winners this year --

01:00:27.806 --> 01:00:31.266 A:middle
two great student apps
worthy of a Design Award,

01:00:32.586 --> 01:00:34.876 A:middle
and 10 other incredible apps.

01:00:35.506 --> 01:00:38.566 A:middle
10 apps that set the
standard for this coming year.

01:00:39.256 --> 01:00:42.596 A:middle
Each of these apps has
something very unique.

01:00:43.316 --> 01:00:44.926 A:middle
They entertain in a new way.

01:00:44.926 --> 01:00:48.016 A:middle
They allow you to
communicate in a new way.

01:00:48.756 --> 01:00:50.146 A:middle
They educate in a new way.

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:53.826 A:middle
They solve real problems
in a clever or new way.

01:00:53.826 --> 01:00:57.986 A:middle
And they open doors for
people and enable people

01:00:57.986 --> 01:00:59.536 A:middle
to do things they
couldn't do before.

01:00:59.536 --> 01:01:02.916 A:middle
And all of them are
incredibly well-designed

And all of them are
incredibly well-designed

01:01:02.916 --> 01:01:08.946 A:middle
and extremely well-executed
on all four of our platforms.

01:01:08.946 --> 01:01:11.526 A:middle
Now winners today get to
take home, as you've seen,

01:01:11.526 --> 01:01:13.056 A:middle
the Apple Design Award Trophy.

When you tap it,
it lights up just

so many of you

01:01:58.336 --> 01:02:00.626 A:middle

come along and then some

01:02:00.626 --> 01:02:01.806 A:middle
of them to arrive on stage.

01:02:01.806 --> 01:02:04.006 A:middle
It's always fun to
give out these awards.

01:02:04.646 --> 01:02:09.256 A:middle
But before we wrap up tonight,
we just wanted to tell you

01:02:09.256 --> 01:02:11.566 A:middle
about something else that we've
been working on that's fun.

01:02:11.566 --> 01:02:15.826 A:middle
And it's a little bit apart
from the Design Awards

01:02:15.826 --> 01:02:21.096 A:middle
that we've given out so far, but
it's a great way to end our day.

01:02:21.096 --> 01:02:24.546 A:middle
And it does tie into
building something that's fun,

01:02:24.546 --> 01:02:27.426 A:middle
and unique, and compelling.

01:02:27.946 --> 01:02:33.106 A:middle
So to talk about that, I'd like
to invite Ben Wolstenholme,

01:02:33.106 --> 01:02:39.386 A:middle

developer of iOS and TV OS apps,

01:02:39.476 --> 01:02:40.636 A:middle

about storytelling --

and in particular, comics.

and in particular, comics.

01:03:01.036 --> 01:03:02.906 A:middle
We love comics because they're

01:03:02.906 --> 01:03:05.276 A:middle
such a powerful storytelling
format.

01:03:06.226 --> 01:03:07.746 A:middle
People learn to read
through comics.

01:03:08.396 --> 01:03:10.636 A:middle
People escape into other
worlds through comics.

01:03:11.576 --> 01:03:15.766 A:middle
Most of all, comics are
words and pictures perfect

01:03:15.896 --> 01:03:19.276 A:middle
for the visual world
that we live in.

01:03:19.666 --> 01:03:22.196 A:middle
We've been working closely with
Apple on something that we'd

01:03:22.196 --> 01:03:23.476 A:middle
like to share with you tonight.

01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:26.076 A:middle
As you may have seen earlier,

01:03:26.316 --> 01:03:29.476 A:middle
Apple today launched new
app review guidelines.

01:03:30.486 --> 01:03:31.966 A:middle
They're very different
to the guidelines

01:03:31.966 --> 01:03:34.636 A:middle
that we're all used to, and
they're much more approachable.

01:03:35.936 --> 01:03:38.806 A:middle
And after speaking with Apple
about this new approach,

01:03:39.806 --> 01:03:45.476 A:middle
we collaborated to create --

01:03:58.056 --> 01:04:02.396 A:middle
OK. Apple has put a lot of
thought into reorganizing

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

01:03:58.056 --> 01:04:02.396 A:middle
OK. Apple has put a lot of
thought into reorganizing

01:04:02.396 --> 01:04:04.886 A:middle
and simplifying the
guidelines into five sections.

01:04:05.676 --> 01:04:08.066 A:middle
And this gave us a great
opportunity to work

01:04:08.066 --> 01:04:09.316 A:middle
with different illustrators

01:04:09.686 --> 01:04:14.376 A:middle
and to develop five totally
different graphic styles.

01:04:14.556 --> 01:04:17.006 A:middle
Each section is a visual story.

01:04:18.016 --> 01:04:20.076 A:middle
And we really wanted
the visuals to react

01:04:20.366 --> 01:04:22.696 A:middle
with the serious content
of the guidelines.

01:04:23.536 --> 01:04:26.226 A:middle
It's created a pretty
wild outcome,

01:04:27.666 --> 01:04:29.596 A:middle
and something we hope
will engage people

01:04:30.086 --> 01:04:33.266 A:middle
around these important
topics even

01:04:33.266 --> 01:04:35.446 A:middle
if you think you know
the guidelines already.

01:04:36.196 --> 01:04:37.646 A:middle
It's pretty useful.

01:04:38.596 --> 01:04:41.466 A:middle

available for download

at Madefire is enable people

to turn their stories
into motion books.

01:05:10.966 --> 01:05:14.086 A:middle

are a reading experience

Thank you for joining us
from around the world.

01:07:03.426 --> 01:07:05.586 A:middle
We look forward to seeing
what you're going to create

01:07:05.586 --> 01:07:09.626 A:middle
in this coming year, what you're
going to create based on things

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:13.636 A:middle
that maybe you saw this evening
that inspired you to move

01:07:13.636 --> 01:07:16.156 A:middle
to a new level with your app
and with your development

01:07:16.156 --> 01:07:19.136 A:middle
and with your design, and
inspired by the new things

01:07:19.136 --> 01:07:24.026 A:middle
that you heard today through the
sessions earlier on in this day.

01:07:24.346 --> 01:07:26.536 A:middle
So we'd like to close.

01:07:26.686 --> 01:07:29.446 A:middle
Just before we close, I'd
like to ask the winners

01:07:29.526 --> 01:07:30.806 A:middle
to come back on stage.

01:07:31.126 --> 01:07:33.836 A:middle
And while they're doing that,
I just want to say thank you,

01:07:34.106 --> 01:07:35.976 A:middle
and have a great
week and good night.
