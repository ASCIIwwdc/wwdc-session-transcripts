[ Music ]

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:22.786 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. My name is Tanya,
and I want to welcome you

00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:25.696 A:middle
to the second session about
developing CarPlay systems.

00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:28.616 A:middle
The video to Part 1
is also available.

00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:31.846 A:middle
So if you haven't watched
it, definitely check it out.

00:00:32.576 --> 00:00:34.746 A:middle
In this session, we'll
cover more detail

00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:36.566 A:middle
on how CarPlay is integrated

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.386 A:middle
into a typical automotive
infotainment system.

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:44.296 A:middle
We'll start with a system
overview, then talk about volume

00:00:44.346 --> 00:00:45.616 A:middle
and resource management,

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:48.856 A:middle
and finish by discussing
application state management.

00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:53.126 A:middle
Now, let's dive into an
overview of the system.

00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:56.676 A:middle
If you watched the first video,

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.566 A:middle
you will recall the
software components you need

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.206 A:middle
to implement a CarPlay receiver.

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.206 A:middle
to implement a CarPlay receiver.

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:07.226 A:middle
In summary, you need an IP-based
link to the head unit either

00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:11.346 A:middle
over USB or over Wi-Fi, IP
cline for data exchange,

00:01:11.976 --> 00:01:14.566 A:middle
an instance of the CarPlay
Communication Plug-in

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:18.786 A:middle
implementing the control
protocol, audio framework

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.796 A:middle
to play or record sound,
and a video framework

00:01:21.796 --> 00:01:23.116 A:middle
to render the video stream.

00:01:24.486 --> 00:01:28.646 A:middle
However, those components are
just one of the sub-systems

00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:30.486 A:middle
in a typical automotive
head unit.

00:01:31.556 --> 00:01:33.906 A:middle
In addition to the
CarPlay functionality,

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:37.026 A:middle
your unit has its
own native interface,

00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:39.006 A:middle
audio sources, and logic.

00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:43.086 A:middle
Both together build
the complete head unit.

00:01:44.546 --> 00:01:47.896 A:middle
Then you add all hardware
resources within the vehicle:

00:01:48.326 --> 00:01:54.006 A:middle
Microphone, speakers, displays,
sensors, user input elements,

00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:56.466 A:middle
and you have the
complete system.

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:00.596 A:middle
OK, so we have the full system.

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:00.596 A:middle
OK, so we have the full system.

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:05.426 A:middle
Now the question is how do those
seemingly competing sub-systems

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:06.766 A:middle
work with each other?

00:02:08.196 --> 00:02:09.246 A:middle
Let's understand it.

00:02:10.216 --> 00:02:13.746 A:middle
First, let's look at how
sensor data is exchanged.

00:02:13.906 --> 00:02:16.486 A:middle
And we will take location
data as an example.

00:02:17.226 --> 00:02:20.636 A:middle
Location information includes
data from a GPS receiver

00:02:21.026 --> 00:02:23.816 A:middle
or sensor data like
wheel speed or yield.

00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:27.356 A:middle
The data reaches the
device through iAP2,

00:02:27.896 --> 00:02:30.506 A:middle
must be always available,
and is requested

00:02:30.506 --> 00:02:31.986 A:middle
by the phone when needed.

00:02:33.626 --> 00:02:35.216 A:middle
Next, let's look

00:02:35.216 --> 00:02:38.156 A:middle
at the instrument cluster
or heads-up display.

00:02:39.196 --> 00:02:41.456 A:middle
These secondary displays
are used

00:02:41.456 --> 00:02:43.856 A:middle
to show metadata
provided by the device.

00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:48.656 A:middle
Such metadata could include the
currently-playing music track,

00:02:49.176 --> 00:02:52.816 A:middle
the active phone call,
or starting with iOS 10,

00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:54.736 A:middle
the next turn-by-turn direction.

00:02:55.306 --> 00:02:59.146 A:middle
Again, the data is fired
through the IP protocol

00:02:59.186 --> 00:03:00.796 A:middle
and exchanged on demand.

00:02:59.186 --> 00:03:00.796 A:middle
and exchanged on demand.

00:03:02.606 --> 00:03:05.776 A:middle
Now let's see what happens
on the primary display.

00:03:06.476 --> 00:03:10.006 A:middle
Of course, to operate the
content shown on the display,

00:03:10.386 --> 00:03:12.866 A:middle
the user must either
use a touchscreen,

00:03:13.246 --> 00:03:15.096 A:middle
an app controller, or both.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:18.736 A:middle
So we can consider
the availability

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:21.586 A:middle
of the user input devices
together with the display.

00:03:23.026 --> 00:03:24.986 A:middle
When the CarPlay UI is active,

00:03:25.356 --> 00:03:28.816 A:middle
the unit is rendering the video
stream on the primary display.

00:03:29.236 --> 00:03:32.886 A:middle
And both the screen and the user
input are used by the device.

00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:39.136 A:middle
But if the native user interface
is shown on the screen,

00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:42.786 A:middle
then both the display and
the user input are routed

00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:44.216 A:middle
to the native sub-system.

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:49.586 A:middle
However, additional user
controls on the steering wheel,

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:53.136 A:middle
like the Voice Recognition
button, Next/Previous Track,

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:55.346 A:middle
may be linked to CarPlay even

00:03:55.346 --> 00:03:57.816 A:middle
when the native UI is
shown on the display.

00:03:59.586 --> 00:04:02.906 A:middle
That way, Siri can
be always launched

00:03:59.586 --> 00:04:02.906 A:middle
That way, Siri can
be always launched

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.026 A:middle
or the next audio track played.

00:04:07.406 --> 00:04:11.266 A:middle
OK, now that we looked at the
user interface integration,

00:04:11.486 --> 00:04:12.816 A:middle
let's talk about audio.

00:04:16.946 --> 00:04:21.516 A:middle
Audio in the car can be roughly
separated into three categories.

00:04:22.036 --> 00:04:25.936 A:middle
The first one provides access to
the speakers and the microphone,

00:04:26.326 --> 00:04:29.266 A:middle
and it's used for phone
calls or voice recognition.

00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:32.976 A:middle
Then we have audio playback

00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:36.786 A:middle
for any media content
like radio or music.

00:04:38.106 --> 00:04:41.546 A:middle
And last, we have the alerts
category which is used

00:04:41.546 --> 00:04:45.536 A:middle
for navigation prompts or any
other higher-priority alerts.

00:04:46.926 --> 00:04:48.536 A:middle
Within the native sub-system,

00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:52.606 A:middle
these three categories
are to be found again.

00:04:53.776 --> 00:04:56.996 A:middle
Within CarPlay, we have
a Main audio channel

00:04:57.156 --> 00:04:59.736 A:middle
which includes phone
call, voice recognition

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:01.296 A:middle
and audio playback audio.

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:01.296 A:middle
and audio playback audio.

00:05:02.856 --> 00:05:06.226 A:middle
And an Alternate audio
channel which is reserved

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:09.206 A:middle
for higher-priority
prompts and sounds

00:05:09.316 --> 00:05:12.926 A:middle
such as navigation prompts
or new message notifications.

00:05:15.776 --> 00:05:20.456 A:middle
So the media channel can either
play music coming from the phone

00:05:21.516 --> 00:05:25.656 A:middle
or media playback from one
of the native audio sources.

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:30.266 A:middle
OK, now that we have
looked at media playback,

00:05:30.806 --> 00:05:32.226 A:middle
let's see what happens

00:05:32.516 --> 00:05:34.396 A:middle
when there is a phone
call through CarPlay.

00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:40.126 A:middle
The phone call needs the audio
channel which provides access

00:05:40.196 --> 00:05:42.496 A:middle
to both the microphone
and the speakers.

00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:47.496 A:middle
So media playback is interrupted
and the channels are switched.

00:05:53.046 --> 00:05:56.416 A:middle
And audio switched over to the
channel, which provides access

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:58.856 A:middle
to both the microphone
and the speakers.

00:05:59.516 --> 00:06:03.436 A:middle
In addition to switching
to audio channel,

00:05:59.516 --> 00:06:03.436 A:middle
In addition to switching
to audio channel,

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:07.326 A:middle
the screen switches to CarPlay
to show the phone call UI.

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:10.716 A:middle
And metadata information

00:06:10.766 --> 00:06:13.316 A:middle
on the instrument cluster
is updated as well.

00:06:14.246 --> 00:06:19.806 A:middle
Of course, if the native system
also supports phone calls

00:06:19.806 --> 00:06:23.916 A:middle
outside of CarPlay, then that
phone call is played and shown

00:06:24.026 --> 00:06:25.246 A:middle
on the in-car displays.

00:06:26.576 --> 00:06:28.606 A:middle
But while on a native
phone call,

00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:32.206 A:middle
the user can be using
Apple Maps for navigation.

00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:36.536 A:middle
So each time there is
an approaching turn,

00:06:36.746 --> 00:06:38.566 A:middle
Apple Maps will play a sound

00:06:38.916 --> 00:06:41.336 A:middle
through the announcement
channel to notify the user.

00:06:42.406 --> 00:06:45.256 A:middle
The phone call continues to
be routed through the speakers

00:06:45.256 --> 00:06:50.526 A:middle
of the car, but the turn-by-turn
notifications are also displayed

00:06:50.926 --> 00:06:52.996 A:middle
as they are mixed
with the call audio.

00:06:54.056 --> 00:06:58.026 A:middle
Of course, in such situation,
we would not want the user

00:06:58.616 --> 00:07:02.646 A:middle
to hear the phone navigation
prompt, but just an alert sound

00:06:58.616 --> 00:07:02.646 A:middle
to hear the phone navigation
prompt, but just an alert sound

00:07:02.646 --> 00:07:04.746 A:middle
that an upcoming turn is coming.

00:07:05.146 --> 00:07:09.506 A:middle
And if the user wants to
see where the next turn is,

00:07:09.716 --> 00:07:12.096 A:middle
the main display
may show Apple Maps.

00:07:13.776 --> 00:07:20.076 A:middle
And last, after the phone call
ends, music continues to play

00:07:20.076 --> 00:07:21.616 A:middle
through the native sub-system

00:07:22.336 --> 00:07:24.666 A:middle
as that was what the
user was listening

00:07:24.666 --> 00:07:26.086 A:middle
to prior to the phone call.

00:07:27.086 --> 00:07:31.636 A:middle
Now, the navigation announcement
will include the full-spoken

00:07:31.746 --> 00:07:35.186 A:middle
direction as the user is
no longer on a phone call.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:36.916 A:middle
All right.

00:07:37.906 --> 00:07:43.056 A:middle
As you see, integrating CarPlay
is rather a complex task,

00:07:43.056 --> 00:07:46.056 A:middle
especially in regards to
sharing hardware resources.

00:07:46.956 --> 00:07:49.436 A:middle
But before we get
into those details,

00:07:49.896 --> 00:07:51.416 A:middle
let's look at volume controls.

00:07:54.026 --> 00:07:55.016 A:middle
Volume management.

00:07:56.306 --> 00:08:00.636 A:middle
As you might know, a usual
automotive head unit shows the

00:07:56.306 --> 00:08:00.636 A:middle
As you might know, a usual
automotive head unit shows the

00:08:00.636 --> 00:08:04.616 A:middle
volume indicator while the user
is operating the volume knob,

00:08:04.956 --> 00:08:07.486 A:middle
and that volume knob
operates the volume

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:09.126 A:middle
of the currently-playing audio.

00:08:11.486 --> 00:08:14.436 A:middle
The same principle
applies for CarPlay audio,

00:08:15.016 --> 00:08:18.446 A:middle
but there is a different
volume level setting for each

00:08:18.446 --> 00:08:20.396 A:middle
of the major CarPlay
applications.

00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:23.546 A:middle
Let's look through them.

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:28.106 A:middle
During Siri playback, the volume
knob sets the volume specific

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:29.246 A:middle
to voice interactions.

00:08:30.506 --> 00:08:31.846 A:middle
For an incoming phone call,

00:08:32.056 --> 00:08:33.986 A:middle
the volume of the
ringtone is controlled.

00:08:35.826 --> 00:08:37.785 A:middle
When the user is
on a phone call,

00:08:38.096 --> 00:08:40.426 A:middle
the phone call audio
is controlled.

00:08:42.096 --> 00:08:44.976 A:middle
And if a next turn
is approaching,

00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:46.506 A:middle
navigation prompts are played.

00:08:47.106 --> 00:08:49.896 A:middle
Then, the user can change
the navigation volume.

00:08:50.666 --> 00:08:53.526 A:middle
And remember, media could
be playing in the background

00:08:54.036 --> 00:08:56.876 A:middle
but its volume will be
lowered during those prompts

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:58.526 A:middle
and cannot be adjusted.

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:03.736 A:middle
Once the announcement is over
and music volume is ramped up,

00:09:04.136 --> 00:09:06.856 A:middle
the button controls
the media volume level.

00:09:08.346 --> 00:09:11.646 A:middle
All right, now let's look
at resource management.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:17.526 A:middle
We are going to take a look at
which resources are managed,

00:09:17.856 --> 00:09:19.526 A:middle
talk about how they are managed,

00:09:19.836 --> 00:09:22.176 A:middle
and go over a couple
of typical examples.

00:09:24.386 --> 00:09:27.066 A:middle
So we saw that there are
multiple hardware resources,

00:09:27.706 --> 00:09:30.936 A:middle
but let's understand which
one of them are managed.

00:09:31.146 --> 00:09:33.556 A:middle
And there's only two:

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:37.606 A:middle
The mainScreen representing
the main display in the car,

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:41.356 A:middle
and mainAudio as the
resource giving access

00:09:41.446 --> 00:09:43.016 A:middle
to the car's audio system.

00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:48.456 A:middle
Those resources can either
be taken or borrowed.

00:09:49.466 --> 00:09:52.066 A:middle
When you take a resource,
it belongs to you

00:09:52.066 --> 00:09:53.706 A:middle
for unlimited amount of time.

00:09:54.006 --> 00:09:55.256 A:middle
It's basically yours.

00:09:56.266 --> 00:09:59.466 A:middle
When you borrow a resource,
you may use it for a while,

00:09:59.856 --> 00:10:02.406 A:middle
but you have to give it
back after you're finished.

00:09:59.856 --> 00:10:02.406 A:middle
but you have to give it
back after you're finished.

00:10:04.346 --> 00:10:08.576 A:middle
OK, so let's have the
native user interface take

00:10:08.576 --> 00:10:10.166 A:middle
over the display permanently.

00:10:10.836 --> 00:10:14.366 A:middle
The user can be using native
navigation, or listening

00:10:14.366 --> 00:10:17.486 A:middle
to FM radio, or adjusting
some car settings.

00:10:19.126 --> 00:10:21.696 A:middle
What triggers such permanent
switch to the native UI?

00:10:22.866 --> 00:10:24.676 A:middle
The native UI can
take the screen

00:10:24.676 --> 00:10:29.276 A:middle
when the user presses a hard
key or switches to the native UI

00:10:29.576 --> 00:10:32.276 A:middle
from the entry point
within the CarPlay UI,

00:10:33.346 --> 00:10:36.376 A:middle
or by using the native
voice recognizer to call

00:10:36.376 --> 00:10:38.536 A:middle
out a specific native
application.

00:10:40.866 --> 00:10:44.306 A:middle
Now let's say the user
selects the Apple CarPlay icon

00:10:44.306 --> 00:10:45.366 A:middle
from the main menu.

00:10:48.476 --> 00:10:51.496 A:middle
In this case, CarPlay
takes over the display

00:10:51.666 --> 00:10:53.876 A:middle
as the user explicitly
requested it.

00:10:55.386 --> 00:10:58.676 A:middle
Again, what can trigger
such permanent transition?

00:10:59.376 --> 00:11:01.236 A:middle
Any hard key linked to CarPlay.

00:10:59.376 --> 00:11:01.236 A:middle
Any hard key linked to CarPlay.

00:11:02.066 --> 00:11:05.206 A:middle
Or, as we saw, through
any CarPlay button

00:11:05.296 --> 00:11:06.266 A:middle
within the native UI.

00:11:07.356 --> 00:11:13.246 A:middle
Or through Siri, for example,
by saying, "Open Maps."

00:11:14.086 --> 00:11:16.056 A:middle
Now, there are other
applications

00:11:16.156 --> 00:11:17.936 A:middle
that need to borrow a resource.

00:11:18.506 --> 00:11:22.136 A:middle
Remember, they just need it for
a while and will give it back.

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.366 A:middle
Which applications
are we talking about?

00:11:26.446 --> 00:11:28.906 A:middle
That's phone calls,
voice interactions,

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:32.016 A:middle
notifications, or alerts.

00:11:34.116 --> 00:11:35.416 A:middle
Let's look at an example.

00:11:36.256 --> 00:11:39.396 A:middle
The native UI has taken
the Main Screen resource

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:41.556 A:middle
and is permanently
showing on the display.

00:11:44.006 --> 00:11:45.946 A:middle
Now the user gets a
call through CarPlay.

00:11:46.646 --> 00:11:50.496 A:middle
The CarPlay UI borrows
the screen and is shown

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:52.066 A:middle
for the duration of the call.

00:11:52.986 --> 00:11:59.456 A:middle
Once the call ends, we go back
to the native UI and stay there

00:11:59.456 --> 00:12:01.486 A:middle
until further user action.

00:11:59.456 --> 00:12:01.486 A:middle
until further user action.

00:12:05.046 --> 00:12:07.476 A:middle
Then, let's look at the
Main Audio resource.

00:12:08.366 --> 00:12:11.126 A:middle
Main Audio can be split
in four major types.

00:12:11.516 --> 00:12:14.666 A:middle
Each type is used for a
different CarPlay application

00:12:15.016 --> 00:12:18.256 A:middle
as it provides access to a
different hardware resource.

00:12:19.816 --> 00:12:25.956 A:middle
Media is audio output only and
is used for any media playback.

00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:30.346 A:middle
Alert is also only output

00:12:30.346 --> 00:12:32.816 A:middle
and plays ringtones
and timer alerts.

00:12:34.326 --> 00:12:36.846 A:middle
speechRecognition
is used for Siri

00:12:37.216 --> 00:12:39.256 A:middle
as it adds access
to the microphone.

00:12:40.786 --> 00:12:43.926 A:middle
Same for the telephony type,
which is used for phone calls.

00:12:45.516 --> 00:12:49.786 A:middle
And same for the default, which
is used for undefined audio.

00:12:52.466 --> 00:12:55.246 A:middle
But don't forget the
second audio channel used

00:12:55.246 --> 00:12:57.106 A:middle
for navigation announcement.

00:12:58.336 --> 00:13:00.156 A:middle
alternateAudio is not managed.

00:12:58.336 --> 00:13:00.156 A:middle
alternateAudio is not managed.

00:13:00.606 --> 00:13:03.836 A:middle
It is basically always
available, so there is no need

00:13:03.836 --> 00:13:05.116 A:middle
to take it or borrow it.

00:13:05.946 --> 00:13:09.596 A:middle
alternateAudio is mixed
with any of the audio types

00:13:09.916 --> 00:13:13.516 A:middle
within the mainAudio channel,
and it is always accessible.

00:13:15.186 --> 00:13:18.466 A:middle
And with this, I'm going
to hand off to Tom to talk

00:13:18.466 --> 00:13:19.786 A:middle
about the resource manager.

00:13:20.696 --> 00:13:23.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Tanya.

00:13:23.866 --> 00:13:26.886 A:middle
Hi. I'm Tom, and I also work on
the CarPlay Engineering Team.

00:13:27.616 --> 00:13:30.106 A:middle
So now that you've learned which
resources need to be managed

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:32.956 A:middle
and you know you can either
take or borrow those resources,

00:13:33.356 --> 00:13:35.126 A:middle
let's talk about how you
go about managing them.

00:13:35.616 --> 00:13:39.216 A:middle
To be able to distribute
the resources

00:13:39.216 --> 00:13:42.296 A:middle
between the two sub-systems, we
need some type of arbitrator.

00:13:42.636 --> 00:13:45.456 A:middle
And we call such an
arbitrator a resource manager.

00:13:48.486 --> 00:13:50.976 A:middle
So what does the
resource manager do?

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.466 A:middle
It has three main tasks.

00:13:53.816 --> 00:13:56.436 A:middle
First, it holds the current
state of the whole system.

00:13:57.276 --> 00:14:01.276 A:middle
Second, it follows a set
of strict rules to decide

00:13:57.276 --> 00:14:01.276 A:middle
Second, it follows a set
of strict rules to decide

00:14:01.276 --> 00:14:03.036 A:middle
which system will
get the resource.

00:14:03.686 --> 00:14:06.726 A:middle
Third, based on the current
state and the set of the rules,

00:14:07.316 --> 00:14:10.166 A:middle
it assigns the resource
to one party or the other.

00:14:10.336 --> 00:14:12.356 A:middle
So let's see how this
works in practice.

00:14:13.536 --> 00:14:17.806 A:middle
Let's say both the
native UI and CarPlay need

00:14:17.806 --> 00:14:18.986 A:middle
to show something on the screen.

00:14:20.196 --> 00:14:23.196 A:middle
So both send a request to
have ownership of the display.

00:14:23.936 --> 00:14:28.176 A:middle
Then, the resource manager
checks the internal state

00:14:28.176 --> 00:14:30.476 A:middle
and decides which of the
two should get access

00:14:30.506 --> 00:14:31.936 A:middle
to the display.

00:14:33.626 --> 00:14:34.896 A:middle
Let's say, in this case,

00:14:34.896 --> 00:14:37.306 A:middle
the native UI request
had a higher priority

00:14:37.406 --> 00:14:38.666 A:middle
and the screen is
assigned to it.

00:14:39.156 --> 00:14:41.266 A:middle
The resource manager
sends a notification

00:14:41.266 --> 00:14:43.126 A:middle
that the screen can now
be used by the native UI.

00:14:45.056 --> 00:14:48.516 A:middle
Only then the native UI can
show content on the screen.

00:14:49.416 --> 00:14:51.476 A:middle
It's important to note that
this state is not changed

00:14:51.476 --> 00:14:55.706 A:middle
until the resource
manager has sent an update.

00:14:56.436 --> 00:14:58.006 A:middle
So where does the
resource manager live?

00:14:58.536 --> 00:15:01.486 A:middle
Is it part of the native
system or of CarPlay?

00:14:58.536 --> 00:15:01.486 A:middle
Is it part of the native
system or of CarPlay?

00:15:02.376 --> 00:15:03.686 A:middle
Well, when we designed CarPlay,

00:15:04.006 --> 00:15:05.436 A:middle
we asked ourselves
the same question.

00:15:06.336 --> 00:15:07.516 A:middle
We considered the complexity

00:15:07.516 --> 00:15:10.116 A:middle
of exchanging detailed
information about the resources.

00:15:10.546 --> 00:15:11.436 A:middle
We considered the future.

00:15:12.046 --> 00:15:13.966 A:middle
What, if any, of those
rules needed to be adjusted?

00:15:15.056 --> 00:15:17.556 A:middle
What if new applications became
available through CarPlay

00:15:17.556 --> 00:15:19.836 A:middle
that the vehicle had no
existing designs to handle?

00:15:20.706 --> 00:15:23.896 A:middle
What solution would give us the
greatest flexibility five years

00:15:23.896 --> 00:15:24.456 A:middle
down the road?

00:15:25.086 --> 00:15:27.536 A:middle
So we decided to implement a
system where the complexity

00:15:27.536 --> 00:15:30.646 A:middle
on the native system is lower
and it's easier to update

00:15:30.646 --> 00:15:31.576 A:middle
after the vehicle has been

00:15:31.576 --> 00:15:32.916 A:middle
in the customer's
hands for a while.

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:37.226 A:middle
Hence, the resource manager
is implemented within iOS.

00:15:38.286 --> 00:15:43.076 A:middle
And because the resource
manager is the component

00:15:43.546 --> 00:15:45.206 A:middle
with which the native
system interacts,

00:15:45.206 --> 00:15:46.996 A:middle
we refer to the iPhone
as the controller,

00:15:47.036 --> 00:15:48.906 A:middle
and the head unit
as the accessory.

00:15:49.766 --> 00:15:51.676 A:middle
But don't forget, all

00:15:51.676 --> 00:15:54.156 A:middle
of the iPhone applications
request the same resources

00:15:54.246 --> 00:15:56.226 A:middle
in the same way as
the native UI would.

00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:02.656 A:middle
Next. What commands
can you use to interact

00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:02.656 A:middle
Next. What commands
can you use to interact

00:16:02.656 --> 00:16:03.636 A:middle
with the resource manager?

00:16:04.526 --> 00:16:05.746 A:middle
It's simple.

00:16:06.256 --> 00:16:07.526 A:middle
You only need two commands.

00:16:08.256 --> 00:16:10.186 A:middle
The changeModes command
is used to request

00:16:10.186 --> 00:16:12.876 A:middle
or release a resource, and the
modesChanged command is used

00:16:12.876 --> 00:16:14.266 A:middle
to describe the current states.

00:16:16.296 --> 00:16:18.866 A:middle
changeModes is the notification
sent by the head unit,

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:21.666 A:middle
the accessory in this case,

00:16:21.666 --> 00:16:23.426 A:middle
to the resource manager,
the controller.

00:16:29.286 --> 00:16:32.296 A:middle
This changeModes command
states what the accessory wants

00:16:32.296 --> 00:16:33.426 A:middle
to do with the resource.

00:16:33.886 --> 00:16:36.926 A:middle
It declares why it needs
it and who can take

00:16:36.926 --> 00:16:39.466 A:middle
or borrow the resource
after it is transferred.

00:16:41.586 --> 00:16:43.686 A:middle
The modesChanged is
the notification sent

00:16:43.686 --> 00:16:45.516 A:middle
by the controller
back to the head unit.

00:16:48.306 --> 00:16:50.216 A:middle
modesChanged provides
the current state

00:16:50.466 --> 00:16:53.206 A:middle
which describes who's the owner
of the resources of the system.

00:16:53.986 --> 00:16:55.296 A:middle
It sends so the accessory knows

00:16:55.296 --> 00:16:56.616 A:middle
if a resource has
been transferred

00:16:56.846 --> 00:16:57.996 A:middle
and the owner has changed.

00:17:00.796 --> 00:17:02.616 A:middle
Now we'll talk about how
resource management works

00:17:02.616 --> 00:17:03.286 A:middle
in more detail.

00:17:04.276 --> 00:17:06.276 A:middle
We will start with
the simple action

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:08.736 A:middle
of switching audio
from iOS audio to FM.

00:17:08.876 --> 00:17:11.816 A:middle
Then, we'll talk about
native voice recognition,

00:17:13.016 --> 00:17:14.746 A:middle
then how to handle
a backup camera case

00:17:14.746 --> 00:17:16.685 A:middle
where you would not
want iPhone apps

00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:19.376 A:middle
to interrupt you unless
we walk through an example

00:17:19.376 --> 00:17:21.296 A:middle
where Siri triggers
music playback.

00:17:22.945 --> 00:17:24.636 A:middle
So let's look at
playing FM radio.

00:17:25.646 --> 00:17:27.306 A:middle
Let's say iPhone
music is playing

00:17:27.306 --> 00:17:31.306 A:middle
through the car speakers, then
the user wants to play FM radio

00:17:31.306 --> 00:17:33.456 A:middle
through the native system
and it's the Radio button.

00:17:37.486 --> 00:17:40.316 A:middle
The unit sends a changeModes
request to have ownership

00:17:40.316 --> 00:17:43.096 A:middle
of the speakers,
and it's taking it

00:17:43.376 --> 00:17:45.766 A:middle
as the user might continue
listening to FM radio

00:17:45.766 --> 00:17:47.366 A:middle
for a prolonged period of time.

00:17:48.796 --> 00:17:50.816 A:middle
The controller assigns
the audio to the head unit

00:17:50.816 --> 00:17:52.856 A:middle
and it sends a modesChanged
notification.

00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:57.386 A:middle
And the head unit is the new
owner of the audio resource,

00:18:01.096 --> 00:18:03.026 A:middle
so it can now start
playing FM radio.

00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:05.556 A:middle
The mainAudio resource
is permanently assigned

00:18:05.556 --> 00:18:06.786 A:middle
to the head unit at this point.

00:18:09.556 --> 00:18:11.366 A:middle
So, in summary, this
example showed us

00:18:11.906 --> 00:18:14.906 A:middle
when to take a resource and that
the native system should not use

00:18:14.906 --> 00:18:17.166 A:middle
that resource before it is
the owner of that resource.

00:18:17.166 --> 00:18:24.086 A:middle
Let's look at the next example
using native voice recognition.

00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:27.366 A:middle
FM radio is still playing
from our last example.

00:18:28.666 --> 00:18:29.376 A:middle
Let's see what happens

00:18:29.376 --> 00:18:31.626 A:middle
if the user triggers the
native voice recognizer.

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:37.686 A:middle
The unit requests to temporarily
own the display and audio,

00:18:37.686 --> 00:18:39.826 A:middle
so the transferType
should be set

00:18:39.826 --> 00:18:42.396 A:middle
to borrow the audio and screen.

00:18:43.006 --> 00:18:46.856 A:middle
Both the mainScreen and the
mainAudio are transferred

00:18:46.906 --> 00:18:47.466 A:middle
to the accessory.

00:18:50.006 --> 00:18:53.476 A:middle
And the native voice
recognizer starts.

00:18:55.566 --> 00:18:56.906 A:middle
Once the voice dialogue
is finished,

00:18:57.146 --> 00:18:59.066 A:middle
the head unit returns
the borrowed resources

00:18:59.066 --> 00:19:00.606 A:middle
by sending an unborrow command.

00:18:59.066 --> 00:19:00.606 A:middle
by sending an unborrow command.

00:19:01.886 --> 00:19:05.546 A:middle
And since the unit was
playing FM radio before,

00:19:05.976 --> 00:19:08.276 A:middle
the resource is again
assigned back to the head unit

00:19:10.246 --> 00:19:11.526 A:middle
and FM radio can resume.

00:19:11.686 --> 00:19:15.336 A:middle
Now you may be wondering,
"Why would the accessory need

00:19:15.336 --> 00:19:17.486 A:middle
to borrow the resource if
it was already the owner?"

00:19:17.966 --> 00:19:19.086 A:middle
Well, that's a great question.

00:19:20.136 --> 00:19:22.456 A:middle
Whenever the resource manager
needs to evaluate a request

00:19:22.456 --> 00:19:24.036 A:middle
to change the ownership
of a resource,

00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:26.156 A:middle
it must know what the current
state of the system is.

00:19:26.626 --> 00:19:27.576 A:middle
The resource manager needs

00:19:27.576 --> 00:19:29.366 A:middle
to know why you're
using the resources

00:19:29.366 --> 00:19:31.056 A:middle
so that they can take
the right decision

00:19:31.056 --> 00:19:32.996 A:middle
if somebody else needs
the resource later on.

00:19:35.156 --> 00:19:36.476 A:middle
Let's move on to
our next example,

00:19:37.486 --> 00:19:38.446 A:middle
showing the backup camera.

00:19:40.776 --> 00:19:42.186 A:middle
Let's say CarPlay
audio is playing

00:19:42.186 --> 00:19:44.186 A:middle
and the native UI is
showing on the screen.

00:19:44.886 --> 00:19:47.016 A:middle
When the user switches
into reverse gear,

00:19:47.176 --> 00:19:48.436 A:middle
the unit borrows the screen.

00:19:49.546 --> 00:19:52.366 A:middle
However, notice it also
tells the resource manager

00:19:52.366 --> 00:19:54.156 A:middle
that the screen cannot
be borrowed again.

00:19:59.246 --> 00:20:02.456 A:middle
The resource manager assigns
the display to the native UI

00:19:59.246 --> 00:20:02.456 A:middle
The resource manager assigns
the display to the native UI

00:20:02.456 --> 00:20:04.526 A:middle
and also notes the limitation.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:07.936 A:middle
So the backup camera
is now shown.

00:20:08.736 --> 00:20:10.356 A:middle
CarPlay audio continues to play,

00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:12.766 A:middle
but now the user
gets a phone call.

00:20:15.706 --> 00:20:17.856 A:middle
The iPhone cannot show
any content on the screen

00:20:17.886 --> 00:20:19.966 A:middle
as the head unit has
constrained the access,

00:20:20.196 --> 00:20:22.056 A:middle
but the ringtone plays
through the speakers.

00:20:22.586 --> 00:20:24.676 A:middle
So how did that happen?

00:20:26.046 --> 00:20:27.146 A:middle
With the changeModes command,

00:20:27.146 --> 00:20:29.376 A:middle
the unit told the resource
manager which rules to apply

00:20:29.376 --> 00:20:30.836 A:middle
by the resources
in its possession.

00:20:31.206 --> 00:20:33.136 A:middle
By setting the borrowConstraint
to anytime,

00:20:33.136 --> 00:20:35.026 A:middle
the unit allows the
application to be able

00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:36.126 A:middle
to borrow the resource.

00:20:36.596 --> 00:20:39.536 A:middle
By setting it to user-initiated
only events triggered

00:20:39.536 --> 00:20:40.636 A:middle
by the user can borrow.

00:20:41.566 --> 00:20:44.186 A:middle
With never, no application
can use the resource,

00:20:44.826 --> 00:20:45.756 A:middle
as with this example.

00:20:47.426 --> 00:20:50.276 A:middle
As you see, the constraints
have a major impact

00:20:50.276 --> 00:20:52.166 A:middle
on the system behavior,
so it's very important

00:20:52.166 --> 00:20:53.136 A:middle
that they are used properly.

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:55.956 A:middle
Only restrict access
if there's a need

00:20:55.956 --> 00:20:57.696 A:middle
for immediate user attention.

00:20:58.146 --> 00:20:59.946 A:middle
Do not restrict permanent
ownership

00:20:59.946 --> 00:21:01.536 A:middle
when CarPlay is connected.

00:20:59.946 --> 00:21:01.536 A:middle
when CarPlay is connected.

00:21:02.026 --> 00:21:04.666 A:middle
So that was using backup camera.

00:21:06.286 --> 00:21:08.136 A:middle
And the last example we want
to look at is what happens

00:21:08.136 --> 00:21:09.276 A:middle
when Siri plays music.

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:12.696 A:middle
Again, we start with
FM radio playing.

00:21:13.386 --> 00:21:15.196 A:middle
The user triggers Siri.

00:21:17.896 --> 00:21:19.166 A:middle
Siri is launched on the phone

00:21:19.166 --> 00:21:21.726 A:middle
and the resource manager
tells the native system

00:21:21.726 --> 00:21:23.846 A:middle
that the resources have
been assigned for Siri.

00:21:25.656 --> 00:21:29.386 A:middle
Siri shows up and the user can
ask, "Siri, play some music."

00:21:32.226 --> 00:21:34.386 A:middle
Siri returns the display
and audio resources,

00:21:34.386 --> 00:21:37.066 A:middle
but the music app now needs the
audio resource to play music.

00:21:37.576 --> 00:21:40.926 A:middle
So the resource manager notifies
the unit that mainAudio is now

00:21:40.926 --> 00:21:43.366 A:middle
with the phone, but the screen
returns to the accessory.

00:21:44.446 --> 00:21:46.986 A:middle
The head unit does not
continue to play FM radio,

00:21:47.586 --> 00:21:51.726 A:middle
and so iPhone audio
is heard in the car.

00:21:51.726 --> 00:21:54.956 A:middle
So what did we see here?

00:21:55.456 --> 00:21:57.876 A:middle
On two occasions, the resource
manager changed the state

00:21:57.876 --> 00:21:59.456 A:middle
without a request
by the head unit.

00:21:59.826 --> 00:22:02.676 A:middle
And this is completely
fine because the apps

00:21:59.826 --> 00:22:02.676 A:middle
And this is completely
fine because the apps

00:22:02.676 --> 00:22:05.716 A:middle
on the device request
resources as well.

00:22:05.876 --> 00:22:08.146 A:middle
And if they get them, the
unit is notified about it.

00:22:09.066 --> 00:22:10.116 A:middle
So, how to handle this?

00:22:10.956 --> 00:22:14.126 A:middle
First, after each modesChanged,
you check if you're the owner.

00:22:14.586 --> 00:22:16.666 A:middle
If you are, resume
your activity.

00:22:16.866 --> 00:22:19.286 A:middle
Otherwise, you should wait
for CarPlay to take action.

00:22:20.096 --> 00:22:23.076 A:middle
Second, do not ignore
resource switches to the phone

00:22:23.076 --> 00:22:24.736 A:middle
when they are triggered
by the phone.

00:22:27.106 --> 00:22:28.616 A:middle
OK, so far, we've looked

00:22:28.616 --> 00:22:30.936 A:middle
at examples showing how
resources are being exchanged.

00:22:30.936 --> 00:22:32.976 A:middle
But there is another
situation where both sides want

00:22:32.976 --> 00:22:34.366 A:middle
to accomplish the same task.

00:22:34.826 --> 00:22:38.336 A:middle
So let's look at how
applications are managed.

00:22:38.856 --> 00:22:41.106 A:middle
We need to manage native
and CarPlay applications

00:22:41.106 --> 00:22:42.436 A:middle
which have similar features.

00:22:42.436 --> 00:22:43.986 A:middle
But what are those applications?

00:22:44.876 --> 00:22:47.916 A:middle
They are active route
guidance, phone calls,

00:22:48.186 --> 00:22:49.236 A:middle
and voice recognition.

00:22:51.366 --> 00:22:53.016 A:middle
We achieve those
using appStates.

00:22:53.416 --> 00:22:54.426 A:middle
But what is an appState?

00:22:55.056 --> 00:22:57.636 A:middle
We use different appStates to
record who is currently engaged

00:22:57.636 --> 00:22:59.846 A:middle
in the shared application
that can only be active

00:23:00.186 --> 00:23:03.006 A:middle
on the accessory or the
controller at any given time.

00:23:04.036 --> 00:23:06.186 A:middle
So the three different
appStates are TurnByTurn,

00:23:06.636 --> 00:23:08.516 A:middle
PhoneCall, and Speech.

00:23:09.296 --> 00:23:12.416 A:middle
So let's have a look at how

00:23:12.416 --> 00:23:15.106 A:middle
that route guidance
appState is managed.

00:23:16.966 --> 00:23:19.236 A:middle
When turn-by-turn navigation
is started on the accessory,

00:23:19.456 --> 00:23:21.186 A:middle
it uses a changeModes command

00:23:21.306 --> 00:23:23.516 A:middle
to update the TurnByTurn
appState to be active.

00:23:27.646 --> 00:23:30.636 A:middle
With this example, it is
a last in win situation.

00:23:31.136 --> 00:23:33.236 A:middle
So the controller grants
the TurnByTurn appState

00:23:33.236 --> 00:23:35.826 A:middle
to the accessory, returning a
modesChanged command showing the

00:23:35.826 --> 00:23:38.916 A:middle
accessory as currently
running route guidance.

00:23:40.746 --> 00:23:42.136 A:middle
Now let's look what happens

00:23:42.136 --> 00:23:44.926 A:middle
when the user sets a new
destination using Apple Maps

00:23:45.016 --> 00:23:47.006 A:middle
while the native system
is already guiding.

00:23:47.656 --> 00:23:51.466 A:middle
The user says, "Siri, take me
to the closest coffee shop."

00:23:51.936 --> 00:23:54.866 A:middle
Now, the iPhone has
started route guidance.

00:23:54.956 --> 00:23:57.406 A:middle
So the controller updates
the TurnByTurn appState.

00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:01.416 A:middle
This is the instruction
for the accessory

00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:01.416 A:middle
This is the instruction
for the accessory

00:24:01.416 --> 00:24:04.036 A:middle
to stop its own native
turn-by-turn guidance.

00:24:05.866 --> 00:24:07.766 A:middle
Now, the iPhone has
started route guidance,

00:24:07.766 --> 00:24:09.846 A:middle
so the controller updates
the TurnByTurn appState.

00:24:10.376 --> 00:24:11.876 A:middle
This is the instruction
for the accessory

00:24:11.876 --> 00:24:14.066 A:middle
to stop its own native
turn-by-turn guidance.

00:24:16.126 --> 00:24:18.716 A:middle
So now, the Apple Maps
turn-by-turn directions are

00:24:18.716 --> 00:24:21.766 A:middle
shown on the display and
announcement played over audio.

00:24:21.766 --> 00:24:24.836 A:middle
And there will be no conflict
with the native guidance system.

00:24:27.736 --> 00:24:29.926 A:middle
So now when the Apple Maps
turn-by-turn directions are

00:24:29.926 --> 00:24:31.906 A:middle
shown on the display and
the announcement is played,

00:24:31.966 --> 00:24:34.406 A:middle
there will be no conflict with
the native guidance system.

00:24:36.406 --> 00:24:37.686 A:middle
So that was route guidance.

00:24:38.246 --> 00:24:39.436 A:middle
Now let's look at a phone call.

00:24:41.326 --> 00:24:43.146 A:middle
If the unit supports
a second phone

00:24:43.306 --> 00:24:44.786 A:middle
over Bluetooth Hands-Free
Profile

00:24:44.786 --> 00:24:46.266 A:middle
and there was an
ongoing phone call,

00:24:46.956 --> 00:24:48.836 A:middle
the call uses mainAudio
exclusively.

00:24:49.306 --> 00:24:51.136 A:middle
The phone call cannot
be interrupted.

00:24:51.536 --> 00:24:53.576 A:middle
So what happens if the
user gets a phone call

00:24:53.576 --> 00:24:54.686 A:middle
on the CarPlay device?

00:24:55.996 --> 00:24:58.826 A:middle
The CarPlay call rings
only on the device

00:24:58.826 --> 00:25:00.996 A:middle
as it should not interrupt
the ongoing conversation.

00:24:58.826 --> 00:25:00.996 A:middle
as it should not interrupt
the ongoing conversation.

00:25:01.646 --> 00:25:03.656 A:middle
This is managed using
the PhoneCall appState.

00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:07.216 A:middle
And lastly, let's look
at voice interactions.

00:25:08.146 --> 00:25:11.046 A:middle
If the unit has a native voice
recognizer when it's running,

00:25:11.046 --> 00:25:12.806 A:middle
it has borrowed the resources

00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:15.586 A:middle
and is exclusively using
the speaker microphone

00:25:15.586 --> 00:25:16.686 A:middle
and screen resources.

00:25:17.546 --> 00:25:20.836 A:middle
But it can be interrupted at any
time by user-initiated events.

00:25:21.796 --> 00:25:24.396 A:middle
So if Siri is triggered
by the user,

00:25:25.976 --> 00:25:28.596 A:middle
native voice recognition
ends and Siri continues

00:25:28.636 --> 00:25:29.646 A:middle
on the in-car display.

00:25:30.326 --> 00:25:32.356 A:middle
The Speech appState is
used to achieve this.

00:25:35.126 --> 00:25:38.656 A:middle
So, in summary, CarPlay
relies on the same resources

00:25:38.656 --> 00:25:41.026 A:middle
as your native system and
is designed to coexist

00:25:41.026 --> 00:25:42.706 A:middle
with your native
user experience.

00:25:43.456 --> 00:25:46.346 A:middle
For a great CarPlay experience,
consider resource handling

00:25:46.346 --> 00:25:49.726 A:middle
for each use case and follow the
CarPlay design recommendations.

00:25:50.556 --> 00:25:52.556 A:middle
The CarPlay specifications
are available

00:25:52.556 --> 00:25:53.686 A:middle
through the MFi Program.

00:25:54.456 --> 00:25:56.956 A:middle
