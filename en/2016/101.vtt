Before we start with
the keynote,

00:00:55.016 --> 00:01:01.046 A:middle
we'd like to take a moment
to talk about the tragedy

we'd like to take a moment
to talk about the tragedy

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:03.266 A:middle
that occurred yesterday
in Orlando, Florida.

00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:07.266 A:middle
We offer our deepest sympathies

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:13.016 A:middle
to everyone whose lives were
touched by this violence.

00:01:14.326 --> 00:01:20.226 A:middle
It was senseless, unconscionable
act of terrorism and hate,

00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:24.516 A:middle
aimed at dividing
and destroying.

00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:31.426 A:middle
The Apple community is
made up of people from all

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:34.946 A:middle
around the world, from
all different backgrounds

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:38.026 A:middle
and all different
points of view.

00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:41.816 A:middle
We celebrate our diversity.

00:01:43.056 --> 00:01:45.936 A:middle
We know that it makes
us stronger

00:01:47.226 --> 00:01:49.046 A:middle
and moves everyone forward.

Hello and welcome to WWDC 2016.

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:40.606 A:middle
It's great to be here at the
legendary Bill Graham Auditorium

00:02:40.996 --> 00:02:42.636 A:middle
in beautiful San Francisco.

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:48.106 A:middle
We have a really big and
jam-packed morning planned

00:02:48.176 --> 00:02:50.316 A:middle
for you, and we couldn't
be more excited.

00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:53.146 A:middle
Let me give you some details
on the conference this year.

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:57.666 A:middle
This is our 27th Worldwide
Developers Conference.

00:02:58.306 --> 00:03:01.666 A:middle
The developer community has
never been more vibrant.

The developer community has
never been more vibrant.

00:03:02.146 --> 00:03:05.496 A:middle
We now have 13 million
registered developers

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:08.666 A:middle
with 2 million added
in the last year alone.

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:14.856 A:middle
The conference this year
sold out over 5000 attendees

00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:19.256 A:middle
and millions more watching
on the live stream.

00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:22.756 A:middle
This is truly a worldwide
conference.

00:03:23.226 --> 00:03:27.696 A:middle
We have people here
from over 74 countries.

00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:32.226 A:middle
We're excited that
we're attracting

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:34.476 A:middle
so many new developers.

00:03:34.896 --> 00:03:37.296 A:middle
Over 70% of the attendees

00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:40.246 A:middle
at the conference this year
are attending the conference

00:03:40.246 --> 00:03:41.686 A:middle
for the very first time.

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:46.806 A:middle
Now, we're investing in the
next generation of developers.

00:03:47.346 --> 00:03:51.176 A:middle
We've awarded 350
scholarships this year.

We have over 100 attendees
at the conference this year

00:04:07.376 --> 00:04:09.886 A:middle
that are under 18 years of age.

00:04:12.996 --> 00:04:18.805 A:middle

Wow. I met her yesterday
and she is going

00:04:27.876 --> 00:04:29.826 A:middle
to make one heck of
a great developer.

00:04:36.116 --> 00:04:38.976 A:middle
This week is about
helping you get the most

00:04:38.976 --> 00:04:40.206 A:middle
out of our platforms.

00:04:40.506 --> 00:04:43.336 A:middle
So we have over 100
engineering-led sessions

00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:49.546 A:middle
and over 150 hands-on labs
with over 1000 Apple engineers

00:04:49.616 --> 00:04:51.766 A:middle
on site here to help
you through the week.

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:59.226 A:middle
The App Store started eight
years ago with only 500 apps.

00:05:00.056 --> 00:05:04.866 A:middle
Recently, we passed
a major milestone.

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:10.356 A:middle
We now have 2 million
apps on the App Store.

[ Applause ]

00:05:17.536 --> 00:05:24.296 A:middle
Your 2 million apps had been
downloaded 130 billion times.

00:05:27.646 --> 00:05:33.266 A:middle
And as you know, the App Store
is the best business opportunity

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:34.276 A:middle
for developers.

00:05:34.796 --> 00:05:40.226 A:middle
We're about to pass $50 billion
paid directly to developers.

00:05:40.896 --> 00:05:42.346 A:middle
This is absolutely amazing.

00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:50.356 A:middle
And of course, successful
developers translates

00:05:50.356 --> 00:05:53.706 A:middle
to us having the best apps
on our platform for users

00:05:54.026 --> 00:05:55.826 A:middle
and this is what really matters.

00:05:56.346 --> 00:05:59.076 A:middle
Now, we have a busy
morning planned but I'd

00:05:59.076 --> 00:06:01.716 A:middle

like to take a moment to talk

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:04.426 A:middle
about why we do what
we do at Apple.

00:06:04.426 --> 00:06:11.546 A:middle
Our north star has always been
about improving people's lives

00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:15.026 A:middle
by creating great products
that change the world.

00:06:16.186 --> 00:06:18.446 A:middle
And we've been doing
this for a long time.

00:06:19.806 --> 00:06:25.486 A:middle
But today, for the very first
time, we're going to talk to you

00:06:25.486 --> 00:06:28.276 A:middle
about four Apple platforms.

00:06:29.426 --> 00:06:33.906 A:middle
Each of these platforms
is category-defining

00:06:34.626 --> 00:06:35.736 A:middle
and world-changing.

00:06:37.026 --> 00:06:40.896 A:middle
The Macintosh changed
personal computing.

00:06:41.706 --> 00:06:44.166 A:middle
Today, it's the most innovative

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:46.326 A:middle
and loved personal
computer on the planet.

00:06:47.446 --> 00:06:50.616 A:middle
iPhone changed phones forever.

00:06:51.106 --> 00:06:55.206 A:middle
It's the best smartphone
experience and the gold standard

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:57.016 A:middle
by which everything
else is measured.

00:06:58.176 --> 00:07:04.036 A:middle

a glass canvas into anything

a glass canvas into anything

00:07:04.036 --> 00:07:05.166 A:middle

00:07:05.916 --> 00:07:08.606 A:middle
It's our clearest
expression of the future

00:07:08.606 --> 00:07:09.966 A:middle
of personal computing.

00:07:11.176 --> 00:07:14.486 A:middle
Apple Watch, only one year old,

00:07:15.146 --> 00:07:18.566 A:middle
it's already the ultimate
device for a healthy life.

00:07:19.686 --> 00:07:25.176 A:middle
And Apple TV just announced
last fall based on the idea

00:07:25.176 --> 00:07:27.366 A:middle
that the future of TV is apps,

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:31.636 A:middle
it's already transforming the
biggest screen in our homes.

00:07:32.616 --> 00:07:36.276 A:middle
Now, we love creating
great apps,

00:07:36.836 --> 00:07:40.836 A:middle
we love creating great
products that change the world,

00:07:40.836 --> 00:07:43.446 A:middle
but we can't do it alone.

00:07:44.736 --> 00:07:47.996 A:middle
Developers are a crucial
part of that journey.

00:07:49.086 --> 00:07:53.406 A:middle
You are about-- You are a
part of everything that we do,

00:07:54.626 --> 00:07:57.176 A:middle
and everything that we
will do going forward.

00:07:58.036 --> 00:08:01.546 A:middle
Because it's together that
we enrich people's lives.

Because it's together that
we enrich people's lives.

Now, we offer you four
incredible platforms

00:08:08.076 --> 00:08:11.306 A:middle
that power these world-changing
product experiences.

00:08:12.616 --> 00:08:15.906 A:middle
watchOS, tvOS, OS X, iOS.

00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:24.726 A:middle
We're going to move each of
these platforms forward today

00:08:24.726 --> 00:08:28.336 A:middle
and we'd like to get
started with watchOS.

00:08:28.336 --> 00:08:32.096 A:middle
And to do that, I'd like
to invite Kevin Lynch up.

00:08:32.096 --> 00:08:32.515 A:middle

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Tim.

00:08:42.336 --> 00:08:45.066 A:middle
So I am really excited to
talk with you about watchOS

00:08:45.116 --> 00:08:46.646 A:middle
and show you some
of what's ahead.

00:08:46.646 --> 00:08:50.236 A:middle
Now, people who are using Apple
Watch love it, particularly

00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:53.226 A:middle
for quick glances at information
and quick interactions.

00:08:53.716 --> 00:08:56.846 A:middle
And our top focus is performance
and we've made optimizations

00:08:56.846 --> 00:09:00.286 A:middle
across the entire system
including a serious acceleration

00:08:56.846 --> 00:09:00.286 A:middle
across the entire system
including a serious acceleration

00:09:00.286 --> 00:09:01.446 A:middle
in app launch time.

00:09:02.126 --> 00:09:03.966 A:middle
Your app should actually
respond instantly.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:09:09.006 --> 00:09:09.926 A:middle
The information you look

00:09:09.926 --> 00:09:11.846 A:middle
at should be updated
before you go look,

00:09:11.846 --> 00:09:14.346 A:middle
so it's ready the instant that
you are so you're not waiting.

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:18.756 A:middle
In watchOS 3, your favorite
apps can respond instantly.

00:09:18.846 --> 00:09:20.186 A:middle
So let's take a look.

00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:21.626 A:middle
So we're going to
accomplish this

00:09:21.626 --> 00:09:23.246 A:middle
by keeping your favorite
apps in memory.

00:09:23.246 --> 00:09:25.546 A:middle
We're going to support
background updates of data

00:09:25.546 --> 00:09:27.746 A:middle
and refresh the information
so it's ready the instant

00:09:27.746 --> 00:09:30.716 A:middle
that you are, and then we
support quickly launching these

00:09:30.716 --> 00:09:31.986 A:middle
apps and interacting with them.

00:09:31.986 --> 00:09:34.636 A:middle
This is going to work for
both the built-in apps

00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:35.936 A:middle
and third-party apps.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:37.996 A:middle
Let's take a look at an example.

00:09:38.796 --> 00:09:41.326 A:middle
This is watchOS 2 and
we're going to look

00:09:41.326 --> 00:09:42.536 A:middle
at an app called Onefootball.

00:09:42.536 --> 00:09:44.656 A:middle
We're going to launch it from
the complication the bottom left

00:09:44.656 --> 00:09:46.326 A:middle
and we're going to
see how long it takes.

00:09:47.496 --> 00:09:50.416 A:middle
So here we are launching
the app, takes a few seconds

00:09:50.416 --> 00:09:53.176 A:middle
to launch, and then once it
launches, it loads some data,

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:54.716 A:middle
and it updates, there we go.

00:09:55.576 --> 00:09:58.466 A:middle
So that is a pretty typical
example of watchOS 2.

00:09:59.206 --> 00:10:00.116 A:middle
Now, we're going to take a look

00:09:59.206 --> 00:10:00.116 A:middle
Now, we're going to take a look

00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:03.176 A:middle
at Onefootball launching
in watchOS 3.

00:10:03.176 --> 00:10:04.686 A:middle
Are you guys ready?

00:10:05.316 --> 00:10:06.096 A:middle
OK, don't blink.

00:10:07.586 --> 00:10:07.976 A:middle
That's it.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:10:16.696 --> 00:10:19.496 A:middle
So that example is about seven
times faster but it feels

00:10:19.496 --> 00:10:20.706 A:middle
like a million times faster.

00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:23.306 A:middle
So now, we've made
it really easy

00:10:23.306 --> 00:10:24.586 A:middle
to access your favorite apps.

00:10:25.346 --> 00:10:27.616 A:middle
You can just press the
side button below the crown

00:10:27.616 --> 00:10:28.906 A:middle
to show what we call the dock.

00:10:29.396 --> 00:10:30.936 A:middle
You can choose which
apps go here

00:10:30.936 --> 00:10:32.506 A:middle
and you can quickly
scroll through them.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.466 A:middle
The apps are now both glanceable
and interactive rather

00:10:40.466 --> 00:10:41.366 A:middle
than separate concepts.

00:10:42.046 --> 00:10:43.186 A:middle
This is a dramatic improvement

00:10:43.186 --> 00:10:44.316 A:middle
in how it feels to
use the watch.

00:10:45.296 --> 00:10:47.456 A:middle
So this increased performance
allowed us to have access

00:10:47.456 --> 00:10:48.956 A:middle
to our favorite apps quickly.

00:10:48.956 --> 00:10:51.416 A:middle
We want to be able to
access them anywhere.

00:10:51.416 --> 00:10:53.786 A:middle
So by using the side button,
we can get to them easily.

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:56.026 A:middle
Now, another key
design goal we had was

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:57.926 A:middle
to make the watch
feel more familiar.

00:10:58.196 --> 00:11:00.506 A:middle
And so we've done
with the watch face,

00:10:58.196 --> 00:11:00.506 A:middle
And so we've done
with the watch face,

00:11:00.536 --> 00:11:01.646 A:middle
now we've added control center.

00:11:01.646 --> 00:11:02.896 A:middle
You just swipe up
from the bottom,

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:05.646 A:middle
just like on iOS,
and very familiar.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:11:09.936 --> 00:11:12.836 A:middle
So this is a giant improvement
at how it feels to use apps

and to navigate the watch very

Now, we've also made it more
powerful to reply to messages.

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:23.436 A:middle
So now, when you receive a
message, you can see the ways

00:11:23.436 --> 00:11:24.306 A:middle
to respond right there.

00:11:24.306 --> 00:11:25.156 A:middle
We've removed this step.

00:11:25.156 --> 00:11:26.566 A:middle
You don't have to
actually press reply now.

00:11:26.566 --> 00:11:27.946 A:middle
You can just pick the
way you'd like to reply.

00:11:28.026 --> 00:11:29.466 A:middle
And if you just scroll down,

00:11:29.686 --> 00:11:31.936 A:middle
you'll see your smart replies
right below the message.

00:11:31.936 --> 00:11:34.696 A:middle
So you can just tap reply
in less than a second.

00:11:35.646 --> 00:11:38.056 A:middle
Now sometimes, you don't see
exactly the response you like

00:11:38.056 --> 00:11:41.266 A:middle
and you're not in a situation
where you can use dictation,

00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:41.926 A:middle
so wouldn't it be great

00:11:41.926 --> 00:11:44.076 A:middle
if you can just write
your message on the watch?

00:11:44.176 --> 00:11:46.966 A:middle
Well, we're introducing a new
way to do that with something

00:11:46.966 --> 00:11:48.116 A:middle
that we call Scribble.

00:11:49.256 --> 00:11:51.066 A:middle
With Scribble, you have
a new way to respond just

00:11:51.066 --> 00:11:52.616 A:middle
by writing what you
like on the screen,

00:11:52.616 --> 00:11:54.186 A:middle
and you can just
quickly draw the letters

00:11:54.186 --> 00:11:55.636 A:middle
for your message right there

00:11:55.636 --> 00:11:57.506 A:middle
like writing something
like Starbucks.

00:11:57.586 --> 00:11:59.606 A:middle
You can see the letters go
right on top of each other.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:12:07.786 --> 00:12:10.116 A:middle
So that's a great new way to
respond with just the response

00:12:10.156 --> 00:12:11.506 A:middle
that you like on your watch.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.716 A:middle
Now, the watch face is
great for quick looks

00:12:14.886 --> 00:12:16.216 A:middle
and it reflects your style

00:12:16.216 --> 00:12:17.696 A:middle
and it's also the
character of the device.

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:20.996 A:middle
Now, we've had Mickey as a fun
watch face that I like to use

00:12:20.996 --> 00:12:23.896 A:middle
on weekends but I know what my
daughter is going to really love

00:12:23.896 --> 00:12:25.976 A:middle
because Minnie is
coming to the watch now.

00:12:30.406 --> 00:12:32.306 A:middle
And of course, you can choose
from a variety of colors

00:12:32.306 --> 00:12:34.196 A:middle
for her outfit that match
her bands perfectly.

00:12:36.966 --> 00:12:38.786 A:middle
Now, one of the most frequent
things people do is look

00:12:38.786 --> 00:12:39.746 A:middle
at their activity rings

00:12:39.746 --> 00:12:41.896 A:middle
and we're adding a new
watch face specifically

00:12:41.896 --> 00:12:44.956 A:middle
for that called Activity, so
it's a great beautiful way

00:12:44.956 --> 00:12:46.216 A:middle
to see your rings
throughout the day.

00:12:50.876 --> 00:12:52.566 A:middle
It comes not only in
the analog version

00:12:52.566 --> 00:12:54.436 A:middle
but also a really nice
chronograph version

00:12:54.436 --> 00:12:57.466 A:middle
and a digital version, so a
super good way for looking

00:12:57.466 --> 00:12:58.776 A:middle
at your progress during the day.

00:12:59.426 --> 00:13:02.226 A:middle
We've also added a really simple
new face that we call Numerals,

We've also added a really simple
new face that we call Numerals,

00:13:02.226 --> 00:13:05.526 A:middle
which is very beautiful,
and the hours actually go

00:13:05.526 --> 00:13:08.536 A:middle
around the dial during day, and
you can choose from a variety

00:13:08.536 --> 00:13:10.306 A:middle
of fonts that match your style,

00:13:10.306 --> 00:13:12.816 A:middle
so a really simple new
watch face called Numerals.

00:13:12.816 --> 00:13:15.546 A:middle
Now, there's a lot of
watch faces to choose from

00:13:15.546 --> 00:13:17.556 A:middle
and we're finding that
people are actually switching

00:13:17.556 --> 00:13:20.236 A:middle
between faces for different
occasions, so we're going

00:13:20.236 --> 00:13:21.786 A:middle
to make that super easy.

00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:25.346 A:middle
You can now just swipe to switch
the face you'd like to use,

00:13:25.466 --> 00:13:27.066 A:middle
and you can choose
which faces you'd like

00:13:27.066 --> 00:13:29.556 A:middle
and how they're configured so
you can easily get to them.

00:13:30.056 --> 00:13:33.066 A:middle
We've also added the ability to
add more complications to faces

00:13:33.226 --> 00:13:34.876 A:middle
like Weather here
on the photo's face.

00:13:35.366 --> 00:13:37.316 A:middle
So now, really simple
to navigate

00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:38.816 A:middle
and use your watch
faces as well.

00:13:39.336 --> 00:13:40.776 A:middle

stuff running live.

to have the opportunity

00:13:56.016 --> 00:13:57.596 A:middle
to show you watchOS 3 today.

just the girl I've
been looking for.

Now, in watchOS 3, you
have a place to keep all

00:14:07.866 --> 00:14:08.786 A:middle
of your favorite apps.

00:14:08.936 --> 00:14:11.616 A:middle
You choose which apps go in your
dock and you choose the order.

00:14:11.616 --> 00:14:13.956 A:middle
I can bring up my dock by
pressing the side button.

00:14:14.376 --> 00:14:17.796 A:middle
And I can swipe through my apps
one at a time or lay my finger

00:14:17.796 --> 00:14:20.026 A:middle
down in these dots at the
bottom of the screen and fly

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:21.686 A:middle
through my dock to
get to any app.

00:14:21.686 --> 00:14:24.616 A:middle
And the apps in my
dock are live,

00:14:25.196 --> 00:14:27.006 A:middle
so I can get a quick
glance at information

00:14:27.396 --> 00:14:29.496 A:middle
without even launching an
app like how close I am

00:14:29.496 --> 00:14:31.056 A:middle
to closing my activity rings.

00:14:31.826 --> 00:14:33.956 A:middle
And the apps have been
redesigned to put me

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:36.106 A:middle
within one tap of the
thing I most want to do.

00:14:36.106 --> 00:14:37.796 A:middle
Let's take a look
at the Timer app.

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:41.516 A:middle
One tap to launch it and it's
right there waiting for me.

00:14:42.106 --> 00:14:46.016 A:middle
I can still set a custom timer
if that's what I want to do,

00:14:46.206 --> 00:14:47.356 A:middle
but the most common choices

00:14:47.356 --> 00:14:49.136 A:middle
for a timer are right
here on the screen.

00:14:49.506 --> 00:14:52.106 A:middle
So with one tap, I can
set a 10-minute timer

00:14:52.106 --> 00:14:55.456 A:middle
and get right back
to what I was doing.

00:14:55.456 --> 00:14:57.936 A:middle
Even my favorite apps from the
App Store can be in my dock

00:14:59.076 --> 00:15:03.466 A:middle

with me throughout the day

off as I get them done.

The message also will include
a map of your current location

with each other.

now show your medical ID

example your age and allergies

and other information
you'd like to put there.

And SOS works not
only just in the US

but it works internationally.

00:18:50.216 --> 00:18:52.576 A:middle
So for example you might
be traveling to some place

00:18:52.576 --> 00:18:55.686 A:middle
like Hong Kong and you might not
know what the emergency number

00:18:55.686 --> 00:18:57.976 A:middle
is to call but your
Apple Watch does.

00:18:58.516 --> 00:19:05.326 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:58.516 --> 00:19:05.326 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:05.826 --> 00:19:08.306 A:middle
So in this case, it calls
999 rather than 911.

00:19:09.066 --> 00:19:11.316 A:middle
So this is an emergency
feature that isn't one

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:13.206 A:middle
that you'll use often
but when you need it,

00:19:13.206 --> 00:19:15.036 A:middle
it's going to be
there and that's SOS.

00:19:15.036 --> 00:19:19.806 A:middle
Now, one of the primary reasons
people are wearing the watch

00:19:19.806 --> 00:19:21.016 A:middle
today is for fitness and health.

00:19:21.016 --> 00:19:23.506 A:middle
And we're enhancing the
activity and workout apps

00:19:23.506 --> 00:19:26.236 A:middle
and we're adding a new app that
we think you're going to love.

00:19:26.426 --> 00:19:28.586 A:middle
Take a look at this,
please welcome Jay Blahnik.

00:19:29.516 --> 00:19:31.816 A:middle
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:19:32.316 --> 00:19:32.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Kevin.

00:19:32.896 --> 00:19:33.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:19:37.516 --> 00:19:39.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So we know that one
of the most popular apps

00:19:39.856 --> 00:19:42.016 A:middle
in the Apple Watch
is the Activity app.

00:19:42.016 --> 00:19:43.576 A:middle
And as Kevin and
Stacey have mentioned,

00:19:43.846 --> 00:19:46.606 A:middle
many people have told us that
they actually become more active

00:19:46.606 --> 00:19:49.576 A:middle
because they become addicted
to closing the activity rings.

00:19:50.016 --> 00:19:50.976 A:middle
And we love hearing that.

00:19:51.096 --> 00:19:54.206 A:middle
But we also know that
many people are motivated

00:19:54.206 --> 00:19:55.096 A:middle
by other things.

00:19:55.636 --> 00:19:57.586 A:middle
Some people are motivated
by getting support

00:19:57.586 --> 00:19:58.776 A:middle
from their family and friends.

00:19:59.166 --> 00:20:01.206 A:middle
And if you're like
me, you're motivated

00:19:59.166 --> 00:20:01.206 A:middle
And if you're like
me, you're motivated

00:20:01.206 --> 00:20:04.026 A:middle
by good old fashion competition
and we wanted to make

00:20:04.026 --> 00:20:05.426 A:middle
that possible as well.

00:20:06.046 --> 00:20:09.076 A:middle
So with watchOS, we're
introducing activity sharing.

00:20:10.266 --> 00:20:11.366 A:middle
And it couldn't be simpler.

00:20:11.756 --> 00:20:13.636 A:middle
All you have to do
is swipe to the right

00:20:13.636 --> 00:20:14.956 A:middle
of your own activity rings

00:20:15.486 --> 00:20:17.386 A:middle
and there you'll see
your selected family

00:20:17.386 --> 00:20:18.746 A:middle
and friend's rings as well.

00:20:18.746 --> 00:20:22.886 A:middle
Now you can sort by whatever
metric is most important to you.

00:20:22.886 --> 00:20:25.676 A:middle
So you can sort by steps,
you can sort by workouts,

00:20:25.996 --> 00:20:27.676 A:middle
you can even sort
by exercise minutes.

00:20:28.036 --> 00:20:31.326 A:middle
Here you'll see that I've sorted
by the move ring and I'm right

00:20:31.326 --> 00:20:32.336 A:middle
where you'd expect me to be.

00:20:32.336 --> 00:20:37.036 A:middle
I'm getting by butt kicked by
Stacey but I'm annihilating Jeff

00:20:37.036 --> 00:20:38.946 A:middle
which makes me very happy.

00:20:40.186 --> 00:20:43.306 A:middle
If you want to see more details,
all you do is tap on anyone

00:20:43.306 --> 00:20:46.036 A:middle
on your activity list and
you'll get an up close look

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:48.856 A:middle
at their activity rings,
but you can also see things

00:20:49.136 --> 00:20:50.306 A:middle
like their daily step count

00:20:50.696 --> 00:20:53.306 A:middle
and their workouts even
from third parties.

00:20:54.456 --> 00:20:56.836 A:middle
But one of my favorite
features is

00:20:56.836 --> 00:20:58.926 A:middle
that you can communicate
directly with the people

00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:00.796 A:middle
that you're sharing
activity with right

00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:00.796 A:middle
that you're sharing
activity with right

00:21:00.796 --> 00:21:02.846 A:middle
in the Activity app
through messages.

00:21:03.706 --> 00:21:06.736 A:middle
And when you do, you'll get
smart replies that are geared

00:21:06.736 --> 00:21:08.036 A:middle
around fitness and activity.

00:21:08.996 --> 00:21:12.696 A:middle
Some are supportive, some
are a little more competitive

00:21:13.336 --> 00:21:15.046 A:middle
but you can also
do some fun things.

00:21:15.046 --> 00:21:16.656 A:middle
For example, at the
end of a workout,

00:21:16.656 --> 00:21:18.226 A:middle
you could send your
raising heart rate to one

00:21:18.226 --> 00:21:19.246 A:middle
of your activity friends.

00:21:19.346 --> 00:21:25.646 A:middle
Or your raising heart rate to
one of your activity friends

00:21:25.946 --> 00:21:30.046 A:middle
or you can also send smack
talk in your own voice right

00:21:30.046 --> 00:21:30.976 A:middle
through audio messages.

00:21:31.806 --> 00:21:33.606 A:middle
So we think this is going
to be a great way for you

00:21:33.606 --> 00:21:35.176 A:middle
and your friends
to stay motivated

00:21:35.486 --> 00:21:39.906 A:middle
to keep each other active and
we can't wait for you to try it.

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:43.246 A:middle
Now, our team has been
working hard to enable features

00:21:43.246 --> 00:21:44.606 A:middle
that would allow more people

00:21:44.606 --> 00:21:46.116 A:middle
to use the Activity
and Workout apps.

00:21:47.186 --> 00:21:48.656 A:middle
And one group we've
been thinking a lot

00:21:48.656 --> 00:21:50.486 A:middle
about is wheelchair users.

00:21:51.586 --> 00:21:53.936 A:middle
Now, many wheelchair users
already have an Apple Watch.

00:21:54.596 --> 00:21:57.076 A:middle
And they've witnessed and
told us that they love it

00:21:57.076 --> 00:21:59.186 A:middle
because it gives them
instant access to messages

00:21:59.186 --> 00:22:00.916 A:middle
and notifications
right from their wrist.

00:21:59.186 --> 00:22:00.916 A:middle
and notifications
right from their wrist.

00:22:00.916 --> 00:22:02.996 A:middle
And this is particularly
important

00:22:02.996 --> 00:22:04.656 A:middle
because many wheelchair
users have

00:22:04.716 --> 00:22:07.856 A:middle
to tuck away their iPhone
securely throughout the day.

00:22:08.266 --> 00:22:10.916 A:middle
But to do a great activity
and workout experience,

00:22:11.086 --> 00:22:13.556 A:middle
we also recognize that we
couldn't just use the same

00:22:13.556 --> 00:22:15.956 A:middle
algorithms that we've used
for non-wheelchair users

00:22:15.956 --> 00:22:18.266 A:middle
because the biomechanics
are completely different.

00:22:19.306 --> 00:22:22.266 A:middle
For example, many wheelchair
users use a semicircular

00:22:22.266 --> 00:22:24.206 A:middle
technique when they're pushing
their wheelchair throughout

00:22:24.206 --> 00:22:24.536 A:middle
the day.

00:22:25.546 --> 00:22:28.676 A:middle
But as the terrain changes
and the speed changes,

00:22:28.676 --> 00:22:30.526 A:middle
they may switch to
an arc technique

00:22:30.616 --> 00:22:32.066 A:middle
or a single-loop over technique.

00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:34.216 A:middle
And this is what
makes it complicated.

00:22:34.296 --> 00:22:36.606 A:middle
These are only a few of the
techniques that they may use.

00:22:37.326 --> 00:22:40.536 A:middle
We knew that to do this right,
we not only have to do a lot

00:22:40.536 --> 00:22:42.736 A:middle
of studies but we
would also need

00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:44.166 A:middle
to enlist the help of experts.

00:22:45.006 --> 00:22:47.526 A:middle
So, we worked with the
Challenged Athletes Foundation

00:22:47.526 --> 00:22:48.796 A:middle
and the Lakeshore Foundation.

00:22:49.166 --> 00:22:51.786 A:middle
These are two of the
world's largest organizations

00:22:51.786 --> 00:22:54.026 A:middle
that are dedicated to
promoting physical fitness

00:22:54.026 --> 00:22:55.216 A:middle
for people in wheelchairs.

00:22:56.106 --> 00:22:58.496 A:middle
With their help, we were
able to conduct the studies.

00:22:59.006 --> 00:23:00.926 A:middle
And we were able to do
it on a wide variety

00:22:59.006 --> 00:23:00.926 A:middle
And we were able to do
it on a wide variety

00:23:00.926 --> 00:23:03.136 A:middle
of wheelchair users
including some veterans.

00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:06.316 A:middle
And now, wheelchair users
will have a setting.

00:23:07.316 --> 00:23:10.656 A:middle
The time to stand notifications
will be changed to time to roll.

00:23:11.516 --> 00:23:17.356 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:19.136 A:middle
There will be two workouts

00:23:19.136 --> 00:23:21.926 A:middle
in the workout apps specifically
dedicated to wheelchair users

00:23:22.086 --> 00:23:24.836 A:middle
and of course the activity
rings will be optimized

00:23:24.836 --> 00:23:25.746 A:middle
for wheelchair pushes.

00:23:26.706 --> 00:23:29.306 A:middle
We could not be more
excited about this feature

00:23:29.306 --> 00:23:31.166 A:middle
and we're incredibly
thankful to our partners

00:23:31.166 --> 00:23:32.356 A:middle
for helping make it possible.

00:23:33.516 --> 00:23:39.036 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:39.536 --> 00:23:41.556 A:middle
Now, one of the things that
we've learned about health

00:23:41.556 --> 00:23:43.376 A:middle
in Apple Watch is
that simple things

00:23:43.376 --> 00:23:45.886 A:middle
like the activity rings
can be very powerful

00:23:45.886 --> 00:23:47.666 A:middle
at helping people
change behavior.

00:23:48.146 --> 00:23:49.986 A:middle
But we also know that
there's a lot more

00:23:49.986 --> 00:23:51.816 A:middle
to health than just fitness.

00:23:52.066 --> 00:23:53.746 A:middle
And we've been thinking
way beyond that.

00:23:54.706 --> 00:23:57.646 A:middle
So with watchOS, we're
launching a brand new app

00:23:57.856 --> 00:23:59.886 A:middle
for health, it's called Breathe.

00:24:00.706 --> 00:24:02.406 A:middle
And it's designed to guide you

00:24:02.406 --> 00:24:04.616 A:middle
through simple deep
breathing sessions

00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:08.066 A:middle
that can help you quiet
your mind, relax your body

00:24:08.066 --> 00:24:10.446 A:middle
and just better deal
with everyday stress.

00:24:11.916 --> 00:24:14.976 A:middle
Now, yoga practitioners have
been using deep breathing

00:24:14.976 --> 00:24:17.476 A:middle
exercises for thousands
of years as a way

00:24:17.476 --> 00:24:19.286 A:middle
to positively impact
the body and mind.

00:24:19.996 --> 00:24:22.976 A:middle
But the medical community has
also embraced deep breathing

00:24:22.976 --> 00:24:24.696 A:middle
as a great way to
improve daily health.

00:24:25.456 --> 00:24:28.436 A:middle
Dr. Deepak Chopra, one
of the early advocates

00:24:28.696 --> 00:24:32.046 A:middle
of body-mind medicine has said,
"Taking a moment every day

00:24:32.046 --> 00:24:34.186 A:middle
to do some deep breathing
can reduce stress,

00:24:34.686 --> 00:24:36.366 A:middle
calm the body-mind as well

00:24:36.366 --> 00:24:37.896 A:middle
as have a long term
health benefits."

00:24:38.596 --> 00:24:41.906 A:middle
Now to get to the
app, it's easy.

00:24:41.906 --> 00:24:44.276 A:middle
You can launch it from your
watch face, you can launch it

00:24:44.276 --> 00:24:47.386 A:middle
from the dock or like
the stand reminders,

00:24:48.436 --> 00:24:51.546 A:middle
you can actually set smart
notifications to remind you

00:24:51.546 --> 00:24:54.646 A:middle
and start building this as
a habit every single day.

00:24:55.886 --> 00:24:58.896 A:middle
When you open the app, you
can easily change the amount

00:24:58.896 --> 00:25:00.226 A:middle
of time you want
to do your session,

00:24:58.896 --> 00:25:00.226 A:middle
of time you want
to do your session,

00:25:00.226 --> 00:25:04.626 A:middle
from one to five minutes just
by turning the digital crown.

00:25:04.806 --> 00:25:07.886 A:middle
And when you're in the app
experience, you'll be guided

00:25:07.886 --> 00:25:10.816 A:middle
by beautiful visuals that make
it really easy to follow along.

00:25:11.266 --> 00:25:13.946 A:middle
And if you prefer to do
this with your eyes closed,

00:25:14.096 --> 00:25:15.506 A:middle
you can turn on the
haptic feedback

00:25:16.096 --> 00:25:18.446 A:middle
and gentle taps will guide you

00:25:18.746 --> 00:25:20.096 A:middle
and you can do without
even looking.

00:25:21.136 --> 00:25:23.176 A:middle
When the session is over,
you'll get a summary.

00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:26.166 A:middle
And you'll also get your heart
rate from the last few seconds

00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:27.656 A:middle
of the session you just did.

00:25:28.236 --> 00:25:30.176 A:middle
Now if you already
do deep breathing,

00:25:30.466 --> 00:25:32.296 A:middle
we think this is going to be
a great way for you to fit it

00:25:32.296 --> 00:25:33.476 A:middle
into your day more often.

00:25:33.996 --> 00:25:35.926 A:middle
But for those of you that
don't, we think this is going

00:25:35.926 --> 00:25:38.996 A:middle
to be a great way to get started
and just one more simple way

00:25:38.996 --> 00:25:40.826 A:middle
that it can help you
live a better day.

00:25:41.396 --> 00:25:43.906 A:middle
These are just a few of the
exciting updates we have planned

00:25:43.906 --> 00:25:45.506 A:middle
for fitness and health
in watchOS.

00:25:45.506 --> 00:25:47.766 A:middle
Now I'm going to give
it back to Kevin.

00:25:48.516 --> 00:25:54.826 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:55.326 --> 00:25:55.836 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Jay.

00:25:55.936 --> 00:25:56.916 A:middle
That was really terrific.

00:25:56.916 --> 00:25:59.236 A:middle
I was actually using the
Breathe app back stage.

00:25:59.236 --> 00:26:00.196 A:middle
It helped me a bit.

00:25:59.236 --> 00:26:00.196 A:middle
It helped me a bit.

00:26:00.826 --> 00:26:06.496 A:middle
So, watchOS 3 is a giant step
forward for you as developers.

00:26:07.486 --> 00:26:10.026 A:middle
When someone adds your apps
to dock or to the watch face,

00:26:10.106 --> 00:26:12.416 A:middle
it benefits from all the
instant launch experience

00:26:12.416 --> 00:26:14.446 A:middle
that we're showing and
you get background time

00:26:14.446 --> 00:26:17.016 A:middle
to update your information
before someone goes and looks.

00:26:17.016 --> 00:26:19.246 A:middle
And that will enable
really quick interactions

00:26:19.246 --> 00:26:20.446 A:middle
with your app on the watch.

00:26:21.026 --> 00:26:23.236 A:middle
Now you can already build
apps that are native to watch

00:26:23.236 --> 00:26:24.936 A:middle
that you can run
independent of iPhone,

00:26:24.936 --> 00:26:26.546 A:middle
but we're also adding a number

00:26:26.546 --> 00:26:28.146 A:middle
of new APIs you can
take advantage

00:26:28.146 --> 00:26:29.636 A:middle
of when you're building
apps for the watch.

00:26:30.746 --> 00:26:33.616 A:middle
One of those is support now
for Apple Pay within your app

00:26:33.616 --> 00:26:35.806 A:middle

do purchases right there.

00:26:36.846 --> 00:26:37.946 A:middle
Fitness apps will now be able

00:26:37.946 --> 00:26:40.686 A:middle
to run the background during
workouts enabling access

00:26:40.686 --> 00:26:43.336 A:middle
to real-time heart rate
information and motion data.

00:26:43.336 --> 00:26:45.636 A:middle
This is going to enable
a whole new category

00:26:45.636 --> 00:26:46.926 A:middle
of fitness apps on the watch.

00:26:48.326 --> 00:26:51.516 A:middle
Also we're enabling a much
richer and expressive apps

00:26:51.516 --> 00:26:54.596 A:middle
in watchOS including support
for SpriteKit and SceneKit,

00:26:54.596 --> 00:26:57.526 A:middle
native event support from the
crown and for touch gestures.

00:26:59.206 --> 00:26:59.976 A:middle

00:27:04.136 --> 00:27:06.816 A:middle
Audio and video can be embedded
right inside your app UI

00:27:06.906 --> 00:27:08.336 A:middle
and you can connect
across devices

00:27:08.336 --> 00:27:09.976 A:middle
with Game Center and CloudKit.

00:27:09.976 --> 00:27:13.106 A:middle
So we're really excited about
what new apps now can be created

00:27:13.106 --> 00:27:15.036 A:middle
on the watch and they're
going to be amazing.

00:27:15.476 --> 00:27:17.746 A:middle
This is a great new
opportunity for all of you.

00:27:17.846 --> 00:27:21.656 A:middle
And the preview release
for you is available today,

00:27:21.656 --> 00:27:22.966 A:middle

00:27:27.886 --> 00:27:31.126 A:middle
And the free upgrade is coming
to all watch users this fall

00:27:31.126 --> 00:27:33.026 A:middle
and it's going to feel
like a whole new watch.

00:27:33.906 --> 00:27:35.076 A:middle
And that's just some
of what's coming

00:27:35.076 --> 00:27:36.976 A:middle
in watchOS, thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; So let's talk about
tvOS and Apple TV.

00:27:57.326 --> 00:28:01.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So let's talk about
tvOS and Apple TV.

00:28:02.086 --> 00:28:05.266 A:middle
Last fall, we introduced the
next generation of Apple TV

00:28:05.396 --> 00:28:08.856 A:middle
and for the first time,
developers had a modern platform

00:28:08.856 --> 00:28:11.616 A:middle
like iOS to develop
for in the living room.

00:28:12.256 --> 00:28:14.846 A:middle
And we said the future
of TV is apps.

00:28:15.816 --> 00:28:18.916 A:middle
And the response to Apple
TV has been incredible.

00:28:19.376 --> 00:28:23.146 A:middle
Here is what Chris Albrecht
the CEO of Starz had to say.

00:28:23.146 --> 00:28:25.746 A:middle
tvOS has allowed Starz
to create an experience

00:28:26.236 --> 00:28:29.036 A:middle
on Apple TV unlike
anything we've done before

00:28:29.036 --> 00:28:30.786 A:middle
and our subscribers
are loving it.

00:28:31.956 --> 00:28:33.416 A:middle
Here is what the CEO of BoomBit,

00:28:33.416 --> 00:28:36.166 A:middle
a very popular iOS game
developer had to say.

00:28:36.396 --> 00:28:39.556 A:middle
We easily extended our iOS game
experience to the living room,

00:28:39.556 --> 00:28:41.656 A:middle
something that is
incredibly difficult to do

00:28:41.656 --> 00:28:42.946 A:middle
on traditional consoles.

00:28:43.876 --> 00:28:47.676 A:middle
Our last generation Apple TV
had 80 video channels and thanks

00:28:47.676 --> 00:28:51.876 A:middle
to many of you, we now have
over 1300 video channels.

First, Sling which
offers a great selection

00:29:06.906 --> 00:29:08.976 A:middle
of live cable channels is
coming to Apple TV today.

new TV service in France

with over 100 live channels
video on demand exclusively

00:29:32.866 --> 00:29:36.186 A:middle
on iOS and Apple TV
coming next month.

00:29:40.486 --> 00:29:44.146 A:middle
Great sports games like
NBA 2K, adventure games

00:29:44.146 --> 00:29:47.376 A:middle
like Minecraft story
mode and SketchParty.

00:29:47.806 --> 00:29:50.576 A:middle
Use your iPhone or iPad
to draw and then you sit

00:29:50.576 --> 00:29:51.666 A:middle
around the TV to guess.

00:29:52.226 --> 00:29:55.816 A:middle
It's a lot of fun to do this
with your group of friends.

00:29:55.946 --> 00:29:58.676 A:middle
Now we've got great updates
to tell you about for tvOS

00:29:58.676 --> 00:30:01.646 A:middle
and let me start with
the Apple TV remote app.

00:29:58.676 --> 00:30:01.646 A:middle
and let me start with
the Apple TV remote app.

00:30:02.476 --> 00:30:05.396 A:middle
Now Apple TV comes with
the incredible Siri remote.

00:30:05.616 --> 00:30:08.796 A:middle
It uses touch for navigation,
Siri to tell it what you want

00:30:08.796 --> 00:30:11.176 A:middle
to watch, and motion
to play games.

00:30:11.796 --> 00:30:13.366 A:middle
But a lot of our
customers have told us

00:30:13.366 --> 00:30:15.176 A:middle
that they would love
an app on their iPhone

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:17.066 A:middle
that had all those
same capabilities,

00:30:17.666 --> 00:30:20.066 A:middle
and so we're making a new
version of the remote app.

00:30:20.386 --> 00:30:21.256 A:middle
This is what it looks like.

00:30:21.256 --> 00:30:22.976 A:middle
It's got a beautiful
mount playing screen

00:30:22.976 --> 00:30:25.186 A:middle
with playback controls,
but most importantly,

00:30:25.186 --> 00:30:27.346 A:middle
all the features
of the Siri remote.

00:30:27.796 --> 00:30:30.506 A:middle
You have touch for navigation,
Siri to give it commands,

00:30:31.146 --> 00:30:34.676 A:middle
and it uses the accelerometer
and gyroscope to play games.

00:30:35.516 --> 00:30:40.006 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:40.506 --> 00:30:43.406 A:middle
And of course, you can enter
text with the keyboard.

00:30:44.406 --> 00:30:48.776 A:middle
Next let's talk about Siri.

00:30:48.886 --> 00:30:51.356 A:middle
Siri changed the way we
interact with our television

00:30:51.606 --> 00:30:53.866 A:middle
because now we just tell
it what we want to watch.

00:30:54.606 --> 00:30:56.306 A:middle
And we're making it even better

00:30:56.306 --> 00:30:58.776 A:middle
because now you can
search movies by topics.

00:30:59.546 --> 00:31:02.136 A:middle
Now my daughter is actually
going to high school this fall

00:30:59.546 --> 00:31:02.136 A:middle
Now my daughter is actually
going to high school this fall

00:31:02.136 --> 00:31:04.176 A:middle
and I remember back when
I went to high school,

00:31:04.236 --> 00:31:06.336 A:middle
it's been a while, there
are some great movies

00:31:06.336 --> 00:31:07.796 A:middle
that I'd love to watch with her.

00:31:08.326 --> 00:31:11.776 A:middle
And now Siri makes this really
easy because I can just say,

00:31:12.006 --> 00:31:13.956 A:middle
find high school
comedies from the 80s.

00:31:13.956 --> 00:31:14.396 A:middle
I'm sorry.

00:31:14.396 --> 00:31:15.546 A:middle
We'll do that one again.

00:31:15.606 --> 00:31:17.416 A:middle
Find high school
comedies from the 80s.

00:31:17.996 --> 00:31:21.816 A:middle
And there are some
of my favorites.

00:31:21.986 --> 00:31:23.346 A:middle
I actually have watched
them all.

00:31:23.346 --> 00:31:25.046 A:middle
Let's take a look at
"Ferris Bueller's Day Off"

00:31:25.046 --> 00:31:27.956 A:middle
and with just one tap,
we can start watching.

00:31:33.006 --> 00:31:38.166 A:middle
Now Siri actually searches over
650,000 movies and TV shows now,

00:31:38.166 --> 00:31:40.436 A:middle
but what about YouTube?

00:31:40.946 --> 00:31:43.886 A:middle
Well, that's easy too
because now you just ask Siri.

00:31:44.256 --> 00:31:48.516 A:middle
Search YouTube for Steph
Curry three pointers.

00:31:51.806 --> 00:31:54.626 A:middle
Siri launches YouTube and
shows you the results.

00:31:55.226 --> 00:31:58.366 A:middle
But a big part of your TV
experience is live channels.

00:31:58.366 --> 00:32:01.896 A:middle
And we've got some great
channels on Apple TV like ABC,

00:31:58.366 --> 00:32:01.896 A:middle
And we've got some great
channels on Apple TV like ABC,

00:32:02.116 --> 00:32:05.416 A:middle
CBS, FX and a lot more that
give you live channels.

00:32:05.416 --> 00:32:07.956 A:middle
But to start watching,
you got to find the app,

00:32:08.456 --> 00:32:10.476 A:middle
you got to launch it and then
you got to find the channel.

00:32:10.476 --> 00:32:13.386 A:middle
Well, we've got a great new
feature called Live Tune-In.

00:32:13.756 --> 00:32:17.356 A:middle
And all you have to
do-- watch ESPN 2.

00:32:18.496 --> 00:32:21.156 A:middle
Take them straight
to the action.

00:32:21.706 --> 00:32:22.416 A:middle

with a lot of great channels

00:32:31.206 --> 00:32:34.126 A:middle
and we're making Live
Tune-In available

00:32:34.126 --> 00:32:37.466 A:middle
on both your iPad
and Apple TV as well.

00:32:38.386 --> 00:32:42.366 A:middle
And one problem with this is,
let's be honest, when you go in

00:32:42.366 --> 00:32:44.546 A:middle
and you launch a video
channel app for the first time,

00:32:44.706 --> 00:32:47.576 A:middle
you get something like this.

00:32:47.576 --> 00:32:49.836 A:middle
And you got to go find
a browser, authenticate

00:32:49.836 --> 00:32:52.896 A:middle
with a code and then
authenticate

00:32:52.896 --> 00:32:54.146 A:middle
to your TV provider.

00:32:54.176 --> 00:32:57.156 A:middle
Well, we're going to make
this change a little bit.

00:32:57.156 --> 00:32:59.756 A:middle
But it's worst because you got
to do it for each in every app.

00:33:00.306 --> 00:33:02.426 A:middle
And now, we're going
to make it all go away

00:33:02.726 --> 00:33:04.566 A:middle
with the feature we
call single sign-on.

And we make it even better,
we-- A page on the after,

00:33:19.886 --> 00:33:22.566 A:middle
we'll show you all of the apps
that you now have access to.

00:33:22.906 --> 00:33:25.146 A:middle
And of course, we're
bringing this to iOS as well.

00:33:25.146 --> 00:33:27.136 A:middle
Now in addition to
single sign-on,

00:33:27.136 --> 00:33:28.416 A:middle
we've got some other
great updates.

00:33:28.926 --> 00:33:31.356 A:middle
Now Apple TV looks
beautiful but there are times

00:33:31.356 --> 00:33:33.516 A:middle
where you wish it was darker
because you're in a home theater

00:33:33.516 --> 00:33:36.366 A:middle
or a dark room and
now that's really easy

00:33:36.436 --> 00:33:38.456 A:middle
because you can just
switch to dark mode.

00:33:43.206 --> 00:33:45.146 A:middle
And we want to make
it even easier

00:33:45.146 --> 00:33:46.906 A:middle
for customers to get your apps.

00:33:47.496 --> 00:33:50.116 A:middle

and I'm going to show you.

and this is really great
and I'm going to show you.

So I get the major league
baseball app on my iPhone,

is right on your Apple TV.

or save the video
to share it later.

many features we've got.

00:35:37.116 --> 00:35:40.956 A:middle
And of course, no
presentation at WWDC

00:35:41.276 --> 00:35:44.376 A:middle
about OS X would be
complete without some kind

00:35:44.376 --> 00:35:45.786 A:middle
of naming controversy.

00:35:46.726 --> 00:35:51.476 A:middle
Now, I'm not talking about
some allegedly baked members

00:35:51.526 --> 00:35:53.986 A:middle
of marketing team going on
some kind of vision quest

00:35:53.986 --> 00:35:56.086 A:middle
around California looking
for a special name.

00:35:57.426 --> 00:36:00.646 A:middle
I'm actually talking about
the name OS X itself.

00:35:57.426 --> 00:36:00.646 A:middle
I'm actually talking about
the name OS X itself.

00:36:01.286 --> 00:36:05.976 A:middle
You know, OS X has been with
us as a name for over 15 years.

00:36:06.466 --> 00:36:07.896 A:middle
And it served us so well.

00:36:07.896 --> 00:36:12.076 A:middle
But as we look at it
alongside its younger brethren,

00:36:13.036 --> 00:36:14.196 A:middle
something sticks out.

00:36:14.956 --> 00:36:18.386 A:middle
We realized that there's a name
that would be so much clearer

00:36:18.486 --> 00:36:19.626 A:middle
and so much more elegant.

00:36:20.156 --> 00:36:22.916 A:middle
And so we're making it so.

00:36:23.176 --> 00:36:26.706 A:middle
The name of the world's most
advanced desktop operating

00:36:26.766 --> 00:36:28.846 A:middle
system is now Mac OS.

00:36:29.516 --> 00:36:38.436 A:middle
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:36:38.936 --> 00:36:42.326 A:middle
Now of course each version of
Mac OS does have a special name

00:36:42.326 --> 00:36:44.596 A:middle
after a place that's
especially important

00:36:44.596 --> 00:36:46.766 A:middle
to us here in California.

00:36:47.526 --> 00:36:50.296 A:middle
And this year's Mac
OS is no different.

00:36:50.706 --> 00:36:53.336 A:middle
But the choice this
time was obvious.

00:36:53.996 --> 00:36:57.966 A:middle
Our latest newest OS
X is macOS Sierra.

[ Applause ]

00:37:05.286 --> 00:37:08.266 A:middle
Now Sierra is a fantastic
new release.

00:37:08.566 --> 00:37:13.506 A:middle
With a big focus on continuity,
the iCloud and the fundamentals

00:37:13.536 --> 00:37:14.836 A:middle
of the Mac experience.

00:37:15.126 --> 00:37:17.276 A:middle
I want to start with continuity.

00:37:17.276 --> 00:37:20.266 A:middle
Because continuity is like
magic, your devices are able

00:37:20.266 --> 00:37:22.466 A:middle
to sense themselves around you

00:37:22.536 --> 00:37:26.326 A:middle
and use secure peer-to-peer
wireless protocols to enable you

00:37:26.326 --> 00:37:28.136 A:middle
to move from one task to another

00:37:28.136 --> 00:37:30.836 A:middle
across your devices
just seamlessly.

00:37:31.426 --> 00:37:33.326 A:middle
What we wanted to
take on this year,

00:37:33.786 --> 00:37:37.956 A:middle
one task that we all do many
times a day every time we start

00:37:37.956 --> 00:37:41.866 A:middle
using our Macs and that
feature is called auto unlock.

00:37:42.316 --> 00:37:42.406 A:middle
So--

00:37:43.516 --> 00:37:47.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:48.056 --> 00:37:49.976 A:middle
Today, when you first
approach your Mac to use it,

00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:51.676 A:middle
the experience is
something like this.

00:37:51.976 --> 00:37:55.316 A:middle
You open it up, you confront
with a password field,

00:37:55.316 --> 00:37:56.786 A:middle
then you type, and
then maybe mistyped,

00:37:56.786 --> 00:37:59.826 A:middle
and then retype your
password, and then you're

00:37:59.826 --> 00:38:00.756 A:middle
in and using your Mac.

00:37:59.826 --> 00:38:00.756 A:middle
in and using your Mac.

00:38:01.286 --> 00:38:02.216 A:middle
But you know for many of us,

00:38:02.216 --> 00:38:04.576 A:middle
we already have a device
securely authenticated

00:38:04.576 --> 00:38:07.366 A:middle
to our wrists that
already knows who we are

00:38:07.366 --> 00:38:08.656 A:middle
and could tell our Mac.

00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:11.326 A:middle
And so then, when
we open our Mac,

00:38:11.326 --> 00:38:13.596 A:middle
it could be a little
bit more like this.

00:38:14.246 --> 00:38:15.436 A:middle
And we're in.

00:38:16.386 --> 00:38:17.436 A:middle
It's that simple.

00:38:18.516 --> 00:38:22.396 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:38:22.896 --> 00:38:25.996 A:middle
And we made this really secure
using time of flight networking

00:38:25.996 --> 00:38:28.836 A:middle
to make sure it's you who's
that close to the machine

00:38:29.096 --> 00:38:30.846 A:middle
who is unlocking it,
so it's really great.

00:38:31.296 --> 00:38:33.126 A:middle
Now, the next continuity feature

00:38:33.726 --> 00:38:38.096 A:middle
in macOS Sierra is
universal clipboard.

00:38:38.836 --> 00:38:41.116 A:middle
Now-- Wow, gasp.

00:38:41.976 --> 00:38:47.486 A:middle
So-- but I know copy and paste
is so fundamental to the way

00:38:47.486 --> 00:38:50.616 A:middle
that we use our Macs
for so many years now.

00:38:50.976 --> 00:38:53.626 A:middle
But what if when you
are on even your iPhone

00:38:53.626 --> 00:38:56.676 A:middle
and you found some new text,
and you just want to copy it,

00:38:56.676 --> 00:38:57.796 A:middle
that when you then
went to your Mac,

00:38:59.196 --> 00:39:01.656 A:middle
well you could just
paste it right in.

00:38:59.196 --> 00:39:01.656 A:middle
well you could just
paste it right in.

00:39:02.396 --> 00:39:05.236 A:middle
And now you can with
images, video,

00:39:05.236 --> 00:39:07.266 A:middle
everything completely automatic.

00:39:11.146 --> 00:39:12.776 A:middle
Now I'd like to move
on to iCloud

00:39:12.776 --> 00:39:14.916 A:middle
and specifically iCloud Drive.

00:39:15.166 --> 00:39:18.156 A:middle
Now today with iCloud
Drive, you can put documents

00:39:18.586 --> 00:39:20.696 A:middle
into your iCloud Drive
that you explicitly want

00:39:20.696 --> 00:39:23.306 A:middle
to make available to you
across your other systems

00:39:23.466 --> 00:39:25.186 A:middle
as well as your iOS devices.

00:39:25.546 --> 00:39:27.346 A:middle
And customers have been
quite a bit of this.

00:39:27.346 --> 00:39:30.346 A:middle
There are actually 10
billion customer documents

00:39:30.346 --> 00:39:31.586 A:middle
in iCloud drive today.

00:39:31.586 --> 00:39:33.876 A:middle
But we want to take
this a step further.

00:39:34.296 --> 00:39:36.216 A:middle
We want all of your documents

00:39:36.506 --> 00:39:39.066 A:middle
and your desktop
accessible to you everywhere.

00:39:39.426 --> 00:39:41.756 A:middle
So that when you're on one Mac,
maybe you're putting things

00:39:41.756 --> 00:39:43.456 A:middle
in your normal documents
folder, well,

00:39:43.456 --> 00:39:44.746 A:middle
of course those should
be available

00:39:44.746 --> 00:39:45.776 A:middle
to you on your other Macs.

00:39:46.566 --> 00:39:49.796 A:middle
But you know for 30 years now,
we all learn to do the work,

00:39:49.796 --> 00:39:51.256 A:middle
the things that we're
working on right now, well,

00:39:51.496 --> 00:39:52.686 A:middle
where do we put those?

00:39:52.906 --> 00:39:54.856 A:middle
So often it's on our desktop.

00:39:55.096 --> 00:39:58.156 A:middle
So let's make our desktop
available on our other Macs

00:39:58.156 --> 00:40:01.586 A:middle
as well and have those
files be available to us

00:39:58.156 --> 00:40:01.586 A:middle
as well and have those
files be available to us

00:40:01.586 --> 00:40:03.246 A:middle
on the go on our iPhones.

00:40:03.866 --> 00:40:04.336 A:middle
Now you can.

Next up, optimized storage.

00:40:13.596 --> 00:40:15.456 A:middle
You know, we love using our Macs

00:40:15.456 --> 00:40:16.956 A:middle
and we fill them
with so much stuff.

00:40:16.956 --> 00:40:19.086 A:middle
But you're going to end up
with a situation like this.

00:40:19.086 --> 00:40:22.386 A:middle
And, we know, what
do you do about it?

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:24.616 A:middle
Well, it turns out we're
going to give you a solution.

00:40:24.616 --> 00:40:26.326 A:middle
And it works in two ways.

00:40:26.536 --> 00:40:30.156 A:middle
First, it helps you make
room for the files that--

00:40:30.156 --> 00:40:33.486 A:middle
your new files by keeping your
older ones up in the Cloud.

00:40:33.816 --> 00:40:36.406 A:middle
So, whether it's your
full resolution photos,

00:40:36.406 --> 00:40:38.706 A:middle
when your others are in
iCloud Drive or movies

00:40:38.706 --> 00:40:41.156 A:middle
that you've already
watched in iTunes

00:40:41.156 --> 00:40:44.416 A:middle
or even those old mail
attachments, we can clear off

00:40:44.446 --> 00:40:46.406 A:middle
that space locally and
make those things available

00:40:46.406 --> 00:40:47.266 A:middle
to you on demand.

00:40:47.586 --> 00:40:49.816 A:middle
But we also want to make
it easy for you to get rid

00:40:49.816 --> 00:40:52.926 A:middle
of files you'll never
use again automatically.

00:40:52.926 --> 00:40:56.016 A:middle
Things like your Safari web
cache and maybe the trash

00:40:56.016 --> 00:40:57.526 A:middle
that you keep forgetting
to empty

00:40:57.526 --> 00:41:00.016 A:middle
and redundant data that's stored
by mail, well, we can get rid

00:40:57.526 --> 00:41:00.016 A:middle
and redundant data that's stored
by mail, well, we can get rid

00:41:00.016 --> 00:41:01.696 A:middle
of all of that as well.

00:41:01.696 --> 00:41:04.316 A:middle
And we provide a really
simple user interface

00:41:04.316 --> 00:41:05.846 A:middle
to help you do it.

00:41:05.966 --> 00:41:09.216 A:middle
Now, as a task, we took a
system that was nearly full,

00:41:09.216 --> 00:41:11.066 A:middle
had about let's say
20 gigs free,

00:41:11.486 --> 00:41:13.256 A:middle
and we put it through the paces.

00:41:13.256 --> 00:41:16.366 A:middle
Now, it had a lot of photos
and a lot of documents.

00:41:16.716 --> 00:41:19.366 A:middle
It had movies that were
already watched, mail with lots

00:41:19.366 --> 00:41:22.256 A:middle
of attachment, apps,
system files and so forth.

00:41:22.256 --> 00:41:24.856 A:middle
And we turned on all the
switches for optimized storage.

00:41:24.856 --> 00:41:29.396 A:middle
And we went from 20 gigs
free to 150 gigs free.

00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:30.446 A:middle
So, we think that's going

00:41:30.446 --> 00:41:31.816 A:middle
to make a difference
for all of you.

Next, Apple Pay.

00:41:40.066 --> 00:41:44.896 A:middle
So, we all love using Apple Pay
in stores to pay with our phones

00:41:45.226 --> 00:41:48.066 A:middle
and our Apple Watch
at the cash register

00:41:48.066 --> 00:41:51.026 A:middle
and to shop inside apps
on our iOS devices.

00:41:51.656 --> 00:41:52.456 A:middle
So, of course, we wanted

00:41:52.456 --> 00:41:54.636 A:middle
to bring this experience
to the Mac.

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:58.526 A:middle
We thought long and hard about
exactly the right way to do it.

00:41:59.076 --> 00:42:00.336 A:middle
And I think we'd nailed it.

00:41:59.076 --> 00:42:00.336 A:middle

for some carrying straps,
can be very helpful.

00:42:13.136 --> 00:42:15.216 A:middle
No, this is not how people
are going to shop on our Macs.

00:42:15.216 --> 00:42:17.806 A:middle
We shop online, on
the web, in Safari.

00:42:17.806 --> 00:42:19.416 A:middle
And so, what are we doing?

00:42:19.816 --> 00:42:21.856 A:middle
We're bringing Apple
Pay to the web.

online, you'll have a Pay

with Apple Pay button
available to you.

00:42:33.966 --> 00:42:37.196 A:middle
When you click it, a sheet comes
down that actually prompts you

00:42:37.196 --> 00:42:41.206 A:middle
to securely authenticate your
purchase using continuity right

just a tap on your wrist.

merchants are signed

up to bring their
web storefronts

00:42:58.166 --> 00:43:00.406 A:middle
up to bring their
web storefronts

00:43:00.736 --> 00:43:02.286 A:middle
to support Apple Pay on the web.

00:43:02.286 --> 00:43:05.576 A:middle
And Apple Pay is expanding
hugely geographically.

And in the next few months,

00:43:13.736 --> 00:43:16.856 A:middle
it's coming to Switzerland,
France and Hong Kong.

00:43:17.676 --> 00:43:19.246 A:middle
Now, next, I want
to move to part

00:43:19.246 --> 00:43:21.846 A:middle
of the Mac experience,
and that's tabs.

00:43:22.306 --> 00:43:26.536 A:middle
You know, many of us love using
tabs to take a mess of windows

00:43:26.536 --> 00:43:29.286 A:middle
that we have in Safari and
get them neatly organized

00:43:29.326 --> 00:43:30.536 A:middle
in tab set.

00:43:30.686 --> 00:43:33.306 A:middle
Well, now, we want
to bring that to all

00:43:33.306 --> 00:43:34.616 A:middle
of your multi-windowed apps.

00:43:34.866 --> 00:43:37.446 A:middle
So, maybe you have multiple
windows open in maps, well,

00:43:37.446 --> 00:43:38.956 A:middle
you could organize
those in tabs.

00:43:39.446 --> 00:43:41.716 A:middle
But because it's built into
the system, you could do

00:43:41.716 --> 00:43:43.516 A:middle
that for third apps as well.

00:43:43.716 --> 00:43:45.676 A:middle
In fact, we've implemented
it in a way

00:43:45.676 --> 00:43:48.266 A:middle
that the apps you already have
installed can support this

00:43:48.426 --> 00:43:51.226 A:middle
out of the box without
any modification,

00:43:51.426 --> 00:43:52.756 A:middle

We love watching
video on the web.

00:44:05.006 --> 00:44:06.196 A:middle
But sometimes, we
like to keep track

00:44:06.196 --> 00:44:07.646 A:middle
of a video while we're
doing other work.

00:44:08.136 --> 00:44:08.866 A:middle
Well now, you can.

You can push the
picture-in-picture button.

00:44:10.386 --> 00:44:12.466 A:middle
Your video goes under
a nice little PIP.

00:44:12.466 --> 00:44:15.496 A:middle
You can move it around the

features in macOS Sierra.

00:44:30.106 --> 00:44:32.716 A:middle
But there is one more.

00:44:33.246 --> 00:44:35.696 A:middle
And this year, I'd
like to unusual step

00:44:35.736 --> 00:44:38.826 A:middle
of letting this feature
introduce itself.

00:44:38.956 --> 00:44:41.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, it's me.

00:44:41.796 --> 00:44:43.236 A:middle
It's sure is great
to be on the Mac.

00:44:43.956 --> 00:44:44.836 A:middle
How about a demo?

00:44:44.996 --> 00:44:45.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:44:45.276 --> 00:44:47.346 A:middle
Siri is coming to the Mac.

[ Applause ]

00:44:52.986 --> 00:44:56.156 A:middle
And it looks like Siri
would like to a give a demo.

00:44:56.476 --> 00:44:57.416 A:middle
So, let's get to it.

00:44:57.696 --> 00:45:02.266 A:middle
So, we have macOS
Sierra right here.

00:44:57.696 --> 00:45:02.266 A:middle
So, we have macOS
Sierra right here.

00:45:02.326 --> 00:45:04.256 A:middle
And the first thing
you'll notice is right here

00:45:04.256 --> 00:45:07.196 A:middle
on the dock, we have
access to Siri.

00:45:07.846 --> 00:45:09.346 A:middle
So, I can ask Siri a question.

00:45:09.346 --> 00:45:11.926 A:middle
Let's say, how do you
like being on a Mac?

00:45:13.576 --> 00:45:16.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Pretty awesome, lots of
space, aluminum unibody walls

00:45:17.016 --> 00:45:19.146 A:middle
and no complaints about
the lack of Windows.

00:45:20.146 --> 00:45:20.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So--

[ Applause ]

00:45:24.826 --> 00:45:27.416 A:middle
So, it's the same Siri
that we know and love.

00:45:27.416 --> 00:45:29.706 A:middle
But now on a Mac, it
can do so much more.

00:45:29.796 --> 00:45:32.986 A:middle
Things like sophisticated
queries for files

00:45:32.986 --> 00:45:37.346 A:middle
like show the files I worked
on last week about the offsite.

00:45:38.026 --> 00:45:42.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Have I ever told you
your file is so styling.

00:45:42.586 --> 00:45:44.626 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, we have my
search results.

00:45:44.626 --> 00:45:46.426 A:middle
But what's really
incredible is I can refine

00:45:46.426 --> 00:45:49.316 A:middle
that sophisticated query
with a follow on like,

00:45:49.316 --> 00:45:52.936 A:middle
just the ones Ken sent me
that I tagged with draft.

00:45:53.586 --> 00:45:56.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; For your filling pleasure.

00:45:56.566 --> 00:45:58.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So you see I have just
the files I'm looking

00:45:58.606 --> 00:45:59.316 A:middle
for right there.

00:45:59.396 --> 00:46:02.446 A:middle
But what's great is this is a
useful result that I may want

00:45:59.396 --> 00:46:02.446 A:middle
But what's great is this is a
useful result that I may want

00:46:02.446 --> 00:46:03.846 A:middle
to throughout the day as I work.

00:46:04.086 --> 00:46:05.936 A:middle
So, I can actually click
on this plus button

00:46:06.106 --> 00:46:09.866 A:middle
and pin it right here into
my notification center.

00:46:10.366 --> 00:46:12.046 A:middle
And it is-- yeah,
it's really great.

00:46:12.046 --> 00:46:14.236 A:middle
And this works for lots
of your Siri results.

00:46:16.156 --> 00:46:19.296 A:middle
So, I'm going to actually open
this team offsite presentation,

00:46:19.706 --> 00:46:21.436 A:middle
just working on a
little project here.

00:46:21.436 --> 00:46:23.006 A:middle
I'll take this one full screen.

00:46:23.246 --> 00:46:24.656 A:middle
We see we're planning
an offsite.

00:46:24.656 --> 00:46:25.746 A:middle
There are a bunch of activities.

00:46:25.746 --> 00:46:28.326 A:middle
But while I'm working in full
screen, Siri is there for me

00:46:28.326 --> 00:46:29.576 A:middle
and helps me multitask.

00:46:29.576 --> 00:46:33.586 A:middle
So, I can do things like, play
my power ballads playlist.

00:46:34.186 --> 00:46:35.566 A:middle
[Background music] Oh yeah.

00:46:38.046 --> 00:46:41.966 A:middle
So, Siri to the rescue
with some awesome tunes.

I can let this play all day.

00:46:44.256 --> 00:46:46.436 A:middle
But I think we'll
get on with the demo.

00:46:46.506 --> 00:46:49.146 A:middle

my Siri results here

to help me complete
this presentation.

00:46:51.046 --> 00:46:53.426 A:middle
So, I have an image result
here for slacklining.

00:46:53.426 --> 00:46:55.486 A:middle
Let me just click
in my Siri result.

00:46:55.936 --> 00:46:57.786 A:middle
Drag it right into
my presentation.

00:46:58.166 --> 00:47:00.186 A:middle
And I can also have Siri
search the web for me.

And I can also have Siri
search the web for me.

00:47:00.186 --> 00:47:03.806 A:middle

for pictures of falconry.

falconry I found on the web.

like some good fun.

results right out of Siri

take my Apple Pencil here

and I'm going to draw a path.

00:47:37.446 --> 00:47:39.226 A:middle
Maybe we'll take
a hike like this,

maybe out over here,
just like that.

just the drawing I want.

But of course, I'd like
to now get it on my Mac.

00:47:45.846 --> 00:47:47.266 A:middle
So, how do I do that?

00:47:47.466 --> 00:47:49.446 A:middle
Well, why don't I just copy it--

00:47:49.446 --> 00:47:52.466 A:middle

my iPad because when I return

like I would anything else,

should just see a movie.

could also drop it right here

I can reposition the PIP
window to any corner.

great in full screen,

back into the browser.

one, that's user experience.

talk about it,

it to you right now?

00:51:59.936 --> 00:52:00.786 A:middle
through 3D Touch.

00:51:59.936 --> 00:52:00.786 A:middle
through 3D Touch.

00:52:01.276 --> 00:52:03.566 A:middle
So, for instance with this
calendar notification,

00:52:03.886 --> 00:52:05.666 A:middle
I can just 3D Touch on it.

00:52:05.786 --> 00:52:08.586 A:middle
And I can jump right in and
get all this rich detail

00:52:08.866 --> 00:52:10.446 A:middle
about this invitation.

00:52:10.446 --> 00:52:11.446 A:middle
I can see my calendar.

00:52:11.446 --> 00:52:13.516 A:middle
And I can accept right here.

00:52:14.196 --> 00:52:16.966 A:middle
Now, this is especially
great with messages.

00:52:16.966 --> 00:52:18.546 A:middle
Let's 3D Touch into that one.

00:52:19.016 --> 00:52:21.896 A:middle
And here, you see, I see the
message that was sent to me.

00:52:21.896 --> 00:52:24.546 A:middle
I can respond right
here, the keyboard.

00:52:24.546 --> 00:52:27.396 A:middle
But what's great is I can
stay in the conversation,

00:52:27.606 --> 00:52:28.906 A:middle
right here on the lock screen.

00:52:28.906 --> 00:52:31.786 A:middle
And even get rich responses
like images right inline.

00:52:31.866 --> 00:52:34.996 A:middle
And this works really well
with third-party apps as well.

00:52:34.996 --> 00:52:37.536 A:middle
So, for instance if I get
a notification from Uber,

00:52:37.536 --> 00:52:42.076 A:middle
I can just press in and I get
this completely interactive

00:52:42.076 --> 00:52:46.836 A:middle
and animated live status update
on my car as it comes in.

00:52:48.106 --> 00:52:48.716 A:middle
It's really great.

00:52:51.436 --> 00:52:52.616 A:middle
Now, of course as always,

00:52:52.616 --> 00:52:54.826 A:middle
you can get your
notifications right here

00:52:54.826 --> 00:52:55.986 A:middle
from the top of the screen.

00:52:56.356 --> 00:52:59.666 A:middle
But now, with 3D Touch,
if you want to clear them,

00:53:00.036 --> 00:53:02.976 A:middle
you can just press in and
clear them all with a tap.

00:53:03.186 --> 00:53:03.966 A:middle
It's really great.

00:53:04.516 --> 00:53:07.586 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:53:08.086 --> 00:53:10.116 A:middle
Now, control center is
available from the bottom

00:53:10.116 --> 00:53:11.006 A:middle
of the screen as well.

00:53:11.006 --> 00:53:12.696 A:middle
We can just swipe
up from the bottom.

00:53:13.116 --> 00:53:14.636 A:middle
See, it's beautifully
redesigned,

00:53:14.636 --> 00:53:16.376 A:middle
gives me great access
to all my controls.

00:53:16.376 --> 00:53:19.576 A:middle
But if I swipe over, you
see, we have a special area

00:53:19.576 --> 00:53:21.716 A:middle
for our music with
nice big controls

00:53:21.716 --> 00:53:23.636 A:middle
and beautiful album
art right there.

00:53:26.656 --> 00:53:29.086 A:middle
Now, we'd made it
easier than ever to get

00:53:29.086 --> 00:53:30.756 A:middle
at your camera from
the lock screen.

00:53:31.066 --> 00:53:33.036 A:middle
So, I can just slide
over from the right,

00:53:33.036 --> 00:53:34.466 A:middle
and there's my camera.

00:53:34.706 --> 00:53:38.666 A:middle
And it's easy to take a picture
of my demo notes, right there.

00:53:39.666 --> 00:53:40.336 A:middle
That's good.

00:53:41.336 --> 00:53:43.436 A:middle
And we've made it easier than
ever to get at your widgets.

00:53:43.436 --> 00:53:45.456 A:middle
Just slide over the other way.

00:53:45.456 --> 00:53:46.936 A:middle
You can see I have my weather.

00:53:47.226 --> 00:53:48.396 A:middle
I have my calendar.

00:53:48.396 --> 00:53:50.416 A:middle
I get my news top stories.

00:53:50.576 --> 00:53:52.636 A:middle
And you notice these widgets
have the ability for me

00:53:52.636 --> 00:53:53.656 A:middle
to get more information.

00:53:53.656 --> 00:53:57.576 A:middle
So, I can do show more and
see the rest of my day.

00:53:57.576 --> 00:53:59.696 A:middle
You'd like to think.

00:54:00.256 --> 00:54:04.096 A:middle
And I can even get more
information right here

00:54:04.096 --> 00:54:05.916 A:middle
from apps on my home screen.

00:54:06.326 --> 00:54:08.086 A:middle
So, for instance, it looks
like I have decent number

00:54:08.086 --> 00:54:09.436 A:middle
of unread e-mail messages.

00:54:09.436 --> 00:54:11.366 A:middle
And now, if I 3D Touch there,

00:54:11.366 --> 00:54:14.626 A:middle
I can see who it is I've been
ignoring this whole time,

00:54:14.696 --> 00:54:15.216 A:middle
my VIPs.

00:54:16.786 --> 00:54:20.196 A:middle
Now, if I swipe over here, I
can also get great information

00:54:20.196 --> 00:54:22.276 A:middle
on the activity without
even launching the app.

00:54:22.276 --> 00:54:24.776 A:middle
I just 3D Touch in and
get a look at my rings.

00:54:25.236 --> 00:54:28.996 A:middle
And this can work really well
with third-party apps as well.

00:54:28.996 --> 00:54:30.436 A:middle
So, I'm going to jump into ESPN.

00:54:30.476 --> 00:54:33.106 A:middle
I can see information
about my latest team.

00:54:33.106 --> 00:54:35.736 A:middle
And if I want that widget
available to me at all times

00:54:35.736 --> 00:54:38.976 A:middle
on My Today view, I can just
add that widget like that.

00:54:38.976 --> 00:54:41.706 A:middle
And I go over to My Today
view, and there it is.

00:54:41.706 --> 00:54:43.756 A:middle
And I can get that
show more information.

00:54:43.946 --> 00:54:45.806 A:middle
And you see, I get
a graphical update

00:54:45.806 --> 00:54:47.576 A:middle
on the highlights
from the last game.

00:54:47.576 --> 00:54:50.896 A:middle
And if I tap in, live action.

00:54:51.276 --> 00:54:52.166 A:middle

00:54:52.946 --> 00:54:54.006 A:middle
Shot clock at seven.

00:54:54.226 --> 00:54:55.716 A:middle
Curry fakes, puts up a three.

00:54:56.736 --> 00:54:57.356 A:middle
Bang.

00:54:57.526 --> 00:54:57.666 A:middle

00:54:57.666 --> 00:54:58.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Stephen Curry from downtown.

00:54:58.926 --> 00:55:00.166 A:middle
It's a 10-point game.

00:54:58.926 --> 00:55:00.166 A:middle
It's a 10-point game.

00:55:01.316 --> 00:55:01.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

00:55:02.126 --> 00:55:05.776 A:middle
So, that is a quick look
at the new lock screen

00:55:05.776 --> 00:55:08.486 A:middle
and home screen experience
in iOS 10.

00:55:08.936 --> 00:55:10.676 A:middle
You have a beautiful
new control center,

00:55:10.976 --> 00:55:14.706 A:middle
interactive notifications and
great ways to use your widgets.

00:55:14.946 --> 00:55:18.076 A:middle
It's great on the iPhone
and the iPad as well.

00:55:18.746 --> 00:55:21.986 A:middle
Next, number two, Siri,

00:55:22.426 --> 00:55:25.196 A:middle
huge part of the user
experience in iOS.

00:55:26.106 --> 00:55:30.566 A:middle
Now, Siri services over
two billion requests a week

00:55:30.566 --> 00:55:31.256 A:middle
from customers.

00:55:31.256 --> 00:55:34.006 A:middle
And there's so many things
that you can ask Siri.

00:55:34.516 --> 00:55:39.236 A:middle
But now in iOS 10, Siri is going
to be able to do so much more

00:55:39.606 --> 00:55:42.556 A:middle
because we're opening
up Siri to developers.

00:55:43.516 --> 00:55:53.076 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:55:53.576 --> 00:55:57.826 A:middle
Now, you'll be able to ask
Siri, things like, send a WeChat

00:55:57.876 --> 00:55:59.716 A:middle
to Nancy saying, I'll
be five minutes late.

00:56:00.636 --> 00:56:03.946 A:middle
And Siri can summon up
the WeChat UI right inside

00:56:04.006 --> 00:56:05.256 A:middle
of the Siri environment.

00:56:06.076 --> 00:56:09.856 A:middle
Now, of course, Siri, because
it understands the domains

00:56:09.856 --> 00:56:12.176 A:middle
of things like messaging,
it allows you to say things

00:56:12.176 --> 00:56:13.256 A:middle
in so many different ways.

00:56:13.256 --> 00:56:16.226 A:middle
I could've said, WeChat Nancy
that I'll be five minutes late

00:56:16.226 --> 00:56:17.566 A:middle
or I need to send a message

00:56:17.566 --> 00:56:20.086 A:middle
to Nancy via WeChat saying
I'll be five minutes late.

00:56:20.086 --> 00:56:22.416 A:middle
And I could do that in all
sorts of different languages.

00:56:22.686 --> 00:56:25.436 A:middle
But because now in iOS 10,
we have an intense API,

00:56:25.436 --> 00:56:29.086 A:middle
it allows Siri to take
on that part of the work

00:56:29.336 --> 00:56:32.456 A:middle
and lets the extension do what
it does best, like messaging.

00:56:32.976 --> 00:56:35.986 A:middle
And so, now, we support
messaging with apps like,

00:56:36.586 --> 00:56:39.756 A:middle
Slack and WhatsApp
and, of course, WeChat.

00:56:40.136 --> 00:56:43.156 A:middle
It could do things like ride
booking in Siri with services

00:56:43.156 --> 00:56:48.626 A:middle
like Uber, Lyft and Didi in
China, photo search for--

00:56:48.696 --> 00:56:52.326 A:middle
in apps like IM,
Shutterfly and Pinterest.

00:56:52.996 --> 00:56:57.496 A:middle
And you could start, pause
and stop your workouts in apps

00:56:57.496 --> 00:57:00.506 A:middle
like MapMyRun, Runtastic
and Runkeeper.

00:56:57.496 --> 00:57:00.506 A:middle
like MapMyRun, Runtastic
and Runkeeper.

00:57:00.976 --> 00:57:04.296 A:middle
And even do payments to
send money to friends,

00:57:04.296 --> 00:57:08.856 A:middle
with things like Number 26,
Square Cash and Alipay in China.

00:57:08.986 --> 00:57:11.806 A:middle
And do VoIP calling through apps

00:57:11.806 --> 00:57:14.696 A:middle
like Cisco Spark,
Vonage and Skype.

00:57:14.756 --> 00:57:17.096 A:middle
And it works great
in the car as well.

00:57:17.096 --> 00:57:21.886 A:middle
Because with CarPlay, you can
now safely send your messages

00:57:21.986 --> 00:57:26.106 A:middle
as well as make VoIP calls all
inside the CarPlay environment

00:57:26.106 --> 00:57:27.216 A:middle
with your favorite apps.

00:57:27.216 --> 00:57:29.936 A:middle
And that's a quick
update on Siri.

00:57:31.516 --> 00:57:37.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:57:38.146 --> 00:57:40.706 A:middle
Number three, QuickType.

00:57:40.706 --> 00:57:44.406 A:middle
And the big news this year is
we're bringing Siri intelligence

00:57:44.646 --> 00:57:45.496 A:middle
to the keyboard.

00:57:46.396 --> 00:57:50.616 A:middle
So, today, QuickType is
able to use a context

00:57:50.616 --> 00:57:53.596 A:middle
to help predict what
words you might type next.

00:57:53.946 --> 00:57:56.026 A:middle
Well, now, we're
using deep learning

00:57:56.026 --> 00:57:57.906 A:middle
and a technique specifically
called LSTMs

00:57:58.636 --> 00:58:02.416 A:middle
to enable much more
intelligence in longer context.

00:57:58.636 --> 00:58:02.416 A:middle
to enable much more
intelligence in longer context.

00:58:02.526 --> 00:58:04.826 A:middle
So, we can tell the difference
between, the Orioles are playing

00:58:04.826 --> 00:58:07.186 A:middle
in the playoffs and the
children are playing

00:58:07.456 --> 00:58:09.406 A:middle
in the park automatically.

00:58:09.406 --> 00:58:12.876 A:middle
And Siri can help you do
responses more intelligently

00:58:12.876 --> 00:58:13.216 A:middle
than ever.

00:58:13.216 --> 00:58:15.556 A:middle
So, you might get
asked, where are you?

00:58:16.036 --> 00:58:18.656 A:middle
Well, Siri can suggest right
there on the suggestion bar

00:58:18.656 --> 00:58:20.606 A:middle
that you supply your
current location.

00:58:20.966 --> 00:58:22.726 A:middle
Tap it and you can
get your location

00:58:22.726 --> 00:58:24.896 A:middle
with the map right
into your transcript.

00:58:25.846 --> 00:58:28.266 A:middle
And people might ask you
about contact information

00:58:28.296 --> 00:58:31.156 A:middle
for a friend, well, Siri
can automatically offer

00:58:31.156 --> 00:58:33.556 A:middle
up the most relevant contacts.

00:58:34.316 --> 00:58:37.756 A:middle
Now, right locally on your
device, Siri has information

00:58:37.756 --> 00:58:39.536 A:middle
about what you've been doing.

00:58:39.676 --> 00:58:42.336 A:middle
And so, it can extract
information from a message

00:58:42.336 --> 00:58:43.616 A:middle
that maybe says,
oh, you're talking

00:58:43.616 --> 00:58:46.086 A:middle
about dim sum at
11 a.m. on Sunday?

00:58:46.086 --> 00:58:46.916 A:middle
Well, when you go

00:58:46.916 --> 00:58:49.256 A:middle
to automatically
create a calendar event,

00:58:49.256 --> 00:58:51.726 A:middle
Siri can prefill it for
you with things like,

00:58:51.726 --> 00:58:53.046 A:middle
oh, that must be brunch.

00:58:53.316 --> 00:58:54.396 A:middle
Fill out the location.

00:58:54.666 --> 00:58:55.486 A:middle
Pick the time.

00:58:55.846 --> 00:58:56.896 A:middle
It's really smart.

00:58:57.716 --> 00:58:59.576 A:middle
And Siri does so much more.

00:59:00.006 --> 00:59:01.986 A:middle
It can check your
calendar availability

00:59:01.986 --> 00:59:02.916 A:middle
for you automatically.

00:59:03.306 --> 00:59:06.276 A:middle
Help you paste a recent
address automatically.

00:59:06.356 --> 00:59:09.756 A:middle
Fill it in based on addresses
you were browsing in other apps.

00:59:10.496 --> 00:59:12.666 A:middle
It can help you look
up terms it recognizes,

00:59:12.666 --> 00:59:14.706 A:middle
things like movies
and restaurants.

00:59:14.706 --> 00:59:16.516 A:middle
With one tap, you can
get more information.

00:59:16.926 --> 00:59:20.136 A:middle
And Siri now-- the
QuickType keyboard supports

00:59:20.136 --> 00:59:21.826 A:middle
multilingual typing.

00:59:22.136 --> 00:59:24.146 A:middle
So, if you like typing
alternating maybe

00:59:24.146 --> 00:59:26.766 A:middle
between English and
Spanish or Italian,

00:59:27.226 --> 00:59:28.556 A:middle
you don't have to
switch keyboards.

00:59:29.356 --> 00:59:30.956 A:middle
QuickType can follow
you automatically.

00:59:31.516 --> 00:59:33.666 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:59:34.166 --> 00:59:35.036 A:middle
So, that's QuickType.

00:59:35.546 --> 00:59:38.596 A:middle
Next, number four is photos.

00:59:39.126 --> 00:59:42.586 A:middle
Now, we love capturing
so much of our lives

00:59:42.716 --> 00:59:45.746 A:middle
on our cameras with--
on our iPhones.

00:59:45.786 --> 00:59:46.716 A:middle
They're so great.

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:49.886 A:middle
And with iCloud Photo Library,
we have those photos with us

00:59:49.916 --> 00:59:51.756 A:middle
across all of our devices.

00:59:52.206 --> 00:59:55.456 A:middle
Well, we wanted to give you
easier ways, of course, to find

00:59:55.456 --> 00:59:57.276 A:middle
and experience the
photos that you've taken.

00:59:57.646 --> 00:59:59.726 A:middle
And one of those is with places.

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:03.436 A:middle
So now, we let you see all
of your photos on a map.

01:00:03.586 --> 01:00:05.946 A:middle
It's a great way to
relive a trip for instance.

01:00:06.326 --> 01:00:09.536 A:middle
But the big news in photos
this year is advanced

01:00:09.536 --> 01:00:10.386 A:middle
computer vision.

01:00:10.896 --> 01:00:13.436 A:middle
We're applying advanced
deep learning techniques

01:00:13.436 --> 01:00:17.006 A:middle
to bring facial recognition
to the iPhone

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:20.266 A:middle
and it's all done locally
on device taking advantage

01:00:20.266 --> 01:00:22.086 A:middle
of the power of the
advanced silicon

01:00:22.446 --> 01:00:24.416 A:middle
in all of our iOS devices.

01:00:24.416 --> 01:00:27.756 A:middle
You can get all of your most
important people automatically

01:00:27.756 --> 01:00:32.506 A:middle
built in the people albums for
you automatically and all done

01:00:32.616 --> 01:00:33.986 A:middle
with your privacy protected.

01:00:34.296 --> 01:00:36.576 A:middle
Now, we're applying the
same kind of technology

01:00:36.576 --> 01:00:40.886 A:middle
with deep learning to object
and scene recognition as well.

01:00:40.886 --> 01:00:45.046 A:middle
In fact, we do 11 billion
computations per photo

01:00:45.366 --> 01:00:47.446 A:middle
to be able to detect
things like there's a horse,

01:00:47.666 --> 01:00:49.286 A:middle
there's water, there's
a mountain.

01:00:49.356 --> 01:00:52.346 A:middle
And with this, you can do
really powerful searching

01:00:52.696 --> 01:00:53.666 A:middle
on your device.

01:00:55.106 --> 01:00:57.746 A:middle
But, you know, sometimes,
the magic in experiencing

01:00:57.746 --> 01:01:00.326 A:middle
in your photos isn't just
about finding the photo

01:00:57.746 --> 01:01:00.326 A:middle
in your photos isn't just
about finding the photo

01:01:00.326 --> 01:01:01.746 A:middle
that you know you're
looking for,

01:01:01.826 --> 01:01:04.796 A:middle
it's about being reminded
serendipitously of a memory

01:01:04.796 --> 01:01:05.946 A:middle
that would be so special.

01:01:05.946 --> 01:01:09.216 A:middle
And so now, we're using
advanced artificial intelligence

01:01:09.516 --> 01:01:13.436 A:middle
to analyze across your entire
photo library, all done locally

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:17.446 A:middle
on device, to cluster together
photos and relate them based

01:01:17.446 --> 01:01:20.706 A:middle
on location, the people
involved, the scenes.

01:01:21.106 --> 01:01:22.796 A:middle
And out of this, be
able to surface memories

01:01:22.796 --> 01:01:25.076 A:middle
that would be most relevant
to you at any given moment.

01:01:25.626 --> 01:01:28.396 A:middle
We can bring forward
things like trips.

01:01:28.396 --> 01:01:30.576 A:middle
We can spot trips that
might be important to you.

01:01:31.006 --> 01:01:33.516 A:middle
We can figure out that you
might want to see photos

01:01:33.516 --> 01:01:36.696 A:middle
of a highlight reel of the
last weekend or the last year

01:01:36.696 --> 01:01:38.426 A:middle
and offer those to you
at just the right time.

01:01:39.466 --> 01:01:42.966 A:middle
We can bring forward memories
of people that are special

01:01:42.966 --> 01:01:44.316 A:middle
to you or groups of people.

01:01:45.036 --> 01:01:48.386 A:middle
And topics, special photos
you took, for instance,

01:01:48.386 --> 01:01:51.056 A:middle
when you're on the water, at
the beach, at the mountains,

01:01:51.056 --> 01:01:53.976 A:middle
these can make wonderful
memories to survey over time.

01:01:54.486 --> 01:01:57.096 A:middle
But most important,
we pull these together

01:01:57.386 --> 01:02:01.666 A:middle
into an intuitive user interface
that makes these so engaging.

01:01:57.386 --> 01:02:01.666 A:middle
into an intuitive user interface
that makes these so engaging.

01:02:02.526 --> 01:02:05.116 A:middle
And I'd like to show
you that experience now.

01:02:06.516 --> 01:02:11.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:02:12.076 --> 01:02:14.016 A:middle
So let's take a look at photos.

01:02:14.016 --> 01:02:17.306 A:middle
So we see there's a photo
album here of a family.

01:02:17.306 --> 01:02:18.006 A:middle
But what you'll notice

01:02:18.006 --> 01:02:20.866 A:middle
at the bottom is this
new tab called Memories.

01:02:21.096 --> 01:02:21.686 A:middle
Let's take a look.

01:02:21.686 --> 01:02:24.906 A:middle
So we can see here, there
are number of memories

01:02:24.906 --> 01:02:27.466 A:middle
that have been offered up
into this memory speed.

01:02:27.466 --> 01:02:28.936 A:middle
And at the top, there's
a vacation

01:02:28.936 --> 01:02:29.896 A:middle
that the system has spotted

01:02:29.896 --> 01:02:32.276 A:middle
where the family took
a trip to Tahoe City.

01:02:32.636 --> 01:02:34.256 A:middle
Let's dive in and take
a look at a memory.

01:02:35.566 --> 01:02:38.006 A:middle
Now you see there's actually
a movie up at the top,

01:02:38.006 --> 01:02:39.296 A:middle
we'll talk more about
that later.

01:02:39.296 --> 01:02:42.146 A:middle
And down below, there's
this beautiful layout

01:02:42.146 --> 01:02:43.736 A:middle
of highlights of the photos.

01:02:43.736 --> 01:02:46.916 A:middle
Now, I can tap Show All
and actually see a grid

01:02:46.916 --> 01:02:48.186 A:middle
of every photo that was taken.

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:50.856 A:middle
But you can see how the
summary intelligently draws

01:02:50.856 --> 01:02:54.056 A:middle
out the most special
photos into these highlights

01:02:54.056 --> 01:02:55.506 A:middle
that are really great to browse.

01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:58.816 A:middle
Now, if we go further down, we
see that it's actually pulled

01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:02.356 A:middle
up a set of people that are in
the photo, the family, grandma

01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:02.356 A:middle
up a set of people that are in
the photo, the family, grandma

01:03:02.356 --> 01:03:03.576 A:middle
and grandpa and the uncle.

01:03:03.576 --> 01:03:06.596 A:middle
And a map of the location where
all of those photos were taken.

01:03:07.256 --> 01:03:08.986 A:middle
And down here at the bottom,

01:03:09.146 --> 01:03:11.256 A:middle
we have related other
memories I might want

01:03:11.256 --> 01:03:12.266 A:middle
to see related to this one.

01:03:12.266 --> 01:03:13.306 A:middle
And it's really smart.

01:03:13.306 --> 01:03:18.026 A:middle
So you see that the Santa Cruz
and Fourth of July memories,

01:03:18.216 --> 01:03:20.176 A:middle
where grandma and grandpa
were both on the trip

01:03:20.176 --> 01:03:21.386 A:middle
into Tahoe City and in these.

01:03:21.386 --> 01:03:22.716 A:middle
So those are offered
up as related.

01:03:23.076 --> 01:03:25.076 A:middle
And this Tahoe City trip
was an outdoor vacation,

01:03:25.076 --> 01:03:26.866 A:middle
so it would offered up
another one like Alaska.

01:03:27.396 --> 01:03:30.116 A:middle
And you can see, there's
another time the family was also

01:03:30.116 --> 01:03:32.126 A:middle
at Tahoe City, but this
time in the winter.

01:03:32.126 --> 01:03:34.676 A:middle
And I'm going to jump in
to that related memory.

01:03:34.716 --> 01:03:38.396 A:middle
And you see once again, we have
photos and videos at the bottom.

01:03:38.396 --> 01:03:41.606 A:middle
But I want to highlight the
movie up here at the top.

01:03:41.806 --> 01:03:44.826 A:middle
You know, we all take so
many pictures and movies

01:03:44.826 --> 01:03:47.036 A:middle
and we never go back to
actually assemble them

01:03:47.036 --> 01:03:48.436 A:middle
into something we'd
want to watch.

01:03:49.096 --> 01:03:52.326 A:middle
But, now our iPhone can do
that for us automatically.

01:03:52.326 --> 01:03:55.016 A:middle
Let's see what the iPhone
has created for this memory.

01:03:56.516 --> 01:04:26.976 A:middle

01:04:27.476 --> 01:04:28.476 A:middle

[ Applause ]

01:04:34.286 --> 01:04:36.496 A:middle
The advanced computer vision

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:39.896 A:middle
of the Photos App is now doing
analysis of just the right parts

01:04:39.896 --> 01:04:42.386 A:middle
of the video to include
the right photos

01:04:42.386 --> 01:04:45.066 A:middle
and it's editing them
together with the right mood

01:04:45.066 --> 01:04:46.426 A:middle
and with the right music.

01:04:46.426 --> 01:04:48.626 A:middle
Now, when you have
a memory like this,

01:04:48.626 --> 01:04:49.736 A:middle
you often want to share it.

01:04:49.736 --> 01:04:51.696 A:middle
And sometimes, you might want
to make it a little shorter say

01:04:51.696 --> 01:04:54.556 A:middle
for sharing, so I can just
use this slider at the bottom

01:04:54.556 --> 01:04:55.926 A:middle
and say, I'd like
it to be shorter.

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:58.376 A:middle
And maybe I want to change
the mood a little it.

01:04:58.376 --> 01:05:00.666 A:middle
You notice there's a mood
slider just up above there

01:04:58.376 --> 01:05:00.666 A:middle
You notice there's a mood
slider just up above there

01:05:00.666 --> 01:05:02.396 A:middle
and that was a pretty
great snowball fight.

01:05:02.396 --> 01:05:03.426 A:middle
So I'll pick epic.

01:05:03.426 --> 01:05:05.406 A:middle
And based on these changes,

01:05:05.436 --> 01:05:09.326 A:middle
it's going to completely
re-edit the movie to new music.

01:05:09.376 --> 01:05:10.386 A:middle

at memories in iOS 10.

01:05:36.696 --> 01:05:39.116 A:middle
It's really fantastic
on your iPhone

01:05:39.116 --> 01:05:41.866 A:middle
and it's great on
your iPad as well.

new features as well.

to browse photo and video

just such a great way

about the big news in all

here at Apple.

Can't wait to do it.

01:06:24.516 --> 01:06:26.646 A:middle
So, let's talk-- Let's
get started with Maps.

01:06:26.756 --> 01:06:29.036 A:middle
Now last year, we
introduced Nearby,

01:06:29.036 --> 01:06:31.726 A:middle
a great way to find
places and transit

01:06:31.726 --> 01:06:33.306 A:middle
with an incredible amount

01:06:33.306 --> 01:06:35.086 A:middle
of detail including
all the entrances

01:06:35.086 --> 01:06:36.736 A:middle
and exits from every station.

01:06:37.386 --> 01:06:40.336 A:middle
But for iOS 10, we've got
an all new design for Maps.

01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:43.606 A:middle
It starts with making it
easy to access controls

01:06:43.606 --> 01:06:45.286 A:middle
and details on locations.

01:06:45.866 --> 01:06:48.556 A:middle
And we're making Maps do
more for you in advance.

01:06:48.686 --> 01:06:49.756 A:middle
It's more proactive.

01:06:50.396 --> 01:06:53.436 A:middle
So you slide up from the
bottom and you can suggestions.

01:06:53.886 --> 01:06:57.836 A:middle
Maps knows that usually, at
this time, I usually go to work,

01:06:57.836 --> 01:07:00.646 A:middle
or it can look at a calendar
event and find the location.

01:06:57.836 --> 01:07:00.646 A:middle
or it can look at a calendar
event and find the location.

01:07:02.266 --> 01:07:04.856 A:middle
It also gives you
convenient ways to filter

01:07:04.856 --> 01:07:06.856 A:middle
down in the places
you might want to go.

01:07:07.126 --> 01:07:09.226 A:middle
For example, let's take a
look at restaurants nearby.

01:07:09.226 --> 01:07:12.136 A:middle
But we're in San Francisco,
I feel like seafood.

01:07:12.636 --> 01:07:15.526 A:middle
So I can slide across
the bottom, and now,

01:07:15.526 --> 01:07:17.246 A:middle
I can see all the
seafood restaurants right

01:07:17.246 --> 01:07:18.066 A:middle

as well so you get more
information, it makes it easier

01:07:29.786 --> 01:07:33.396 A:middle
to follow and control and we
even include traffic on route.

01:07:34.646 --> 01:07:38.786 A:middle
Now, when you're driving, it
will automatically zoom in

01:07:38.936 --> 01:07:40.516 A:middle
and as you get to
along straight away,

01:07:40.516 --> 01:07:42.306 A:middle
it willl automatically
zoom back out.

01:07:42.306 --> 01:07:45.836 A:middle
And you can even pan and
zoom way further ahead

01:07:45.836 --> 01:07:47.366 A:middle
to see what the traffic
conditions are.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

01:07:52.666 --> 01:07:55.686 A:middle
Now we give you quick controls
to let you see route details.

01:07:56.086 --> 01:07:59.426 A:middle
So now, you can even look and
see on your route where food

01:07:59.426 --> 01:08:02.716 A:middle
or gas stations are and Maps
will tell you how much longer it

01:07:59.426 --> 01:08:02.716 A:middle
or gas stations are and Maps
will tell you how much longer it

01:08:02.716 --> 01:08:04.406 A:middle
will take if you go
to any one of those.

01:08:09.466 --> 01:08:11.726 A:middle
And of course, we're making
this available on CarPlay.

And if there's a lot
of traffic ahead,

01:08:13.636 --> 01:08:16.236 A:middle
Maps will proactively
give you alternate routes

01:08:16.236 --> 01:08:18.106 A:middle
and tell you how
much time it'll save.

to follow directions while
keeping your eyes on the road,

01:08:23.376 --> 01:08:26.246 A:middle

get turn by turn right

Now, with map extensions,

01:08:43.776 --> 01:08:46.095 A:middle
you can enable all new
capabilities in Maps.

01:08:46.576 --> 01:08:50.145 A:middle
For example, you can make a
reservation using a popular app

01:08:50.145 --> 01:08:51.265 A:middle
like OpenTable.

01:08:51.526 --> 01:08:55.106 A:middle
You pick the number of people,
the time right inside of Maps.

01:08:55.586 --> 01:08:57.805 A:middle

extensions, they're open

And when you're ready to leave,
you tap on directions and now,

01:09:12.866 --> 01:09:14.895 A:middle
you're offered the new
option to book a ride.

01:09:14.956 --> 01:09:19.256 A:middle
And with app extensions like
Uber, you can pick any kind

Apple Pay and see the status.

I can book a reservation, I can
request a car, I can pay for it

01:16:19.976 --> 01:16:22.116 A:middle
I would like to do something
a little bit different

01:16:22.116 --> 01:16:24.076 A:middle
and play something
for the world, right?

01:16:24.506 --> 01:16:25.546 A:middle
So let's play some real hits.

01:16:25.546 --> 01:16:27.246 A:middle
Let's see what we've got.

01:16:27.246 --> 01:16:31.136 A:middle
[Background Music] Now that
sounds like the beginning

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:34.206 A:middle
of some good Ghanaian
highlife music.

01:16:34.206 --> 01:16:35.226 A:middle
All right guys.

01:16:35.226 --> 01:16:36.756 A:middle
Basically, it's all
new Apply Music.

01:16:36.756 --> 01:16:37.716 A:middle
I hope you enjoyed it.

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:38.616 A:middle

Thank you Boz.

01:16:51.056 --> 01:16:52.526 A:middle
That's the all new Apple Music.

01:16:52.526 --> 01:16:56.576 A:middle
It is incredible on your
iPhone, iPad, your Mac and PC.

01:16:56.576 --> 01:17:00.756 A:middle

Number seven, let's
talk about news.

01:17:04.606 --> 01:17:06.796 A:middle
And last fall, we
introduced Apple News

01:17:06.796 --> 01:17:08.106 A:middle
to bring you the best stories

01:17:08.246 --> 01:17:11.746 A:middle
from the best publishers
all personalized for you.

01:17:12.056 --> 01:17:14.476 A:middle
And we introduce it with a
great set of publications,

01:17:14.476 --> 01:17:16.176 A:middle
but we've got a lot more.

01:17:16.526 --> 01:17:20.046 A:middle
We now have over 2,000
publications in Apple News

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:22.136 A:middle
and our readers are loving it.

01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:26.836 A:middle
In fact, we have over 60 million
monthly users reading in news

01:17:27.316 --> 01:17:29.976 A:middle
and with iOS 10, we've
got some big changes.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:32.466 A:middle
It starts with an
all new design.

01:17:33.276 --> 01:17:34.236 A:middle
Here's what it looks like.

01:17:35.356 --> 01:17:38.486 A:middle
We've taken all of the stories
in For You and broken them

01:17:38.486 --> 01:17:42.436 A:middle
up into clear sections which
make them easier to follow.

01:17:42.626 --> 01:17:43.636 A:middle
Here's Top Stories.

01:17:44.976 --> 01:17:47.226 A:middle
Here's Trending where you can
see the most popular stories

01:17:47.226 --> 01:17:47.836 A:middle
right now.

01:17:49.076 --> 01:17:51.216 A:middle
All of the topics you
follow like sports

01:17:52.206 --> 01:17:54.726 A:middle
and news is even smart
enough to create new topics

01:17:54.726 --> 01:17:56.526 A:middle
for you based on what you read.

01:17:56.796 --> 01:17:58.626 A:middle
Here's one for me
on Formula 1 racing.

where our editors
handpick the best stories.

01:18:04.816 --> 01:18:08.746 A:middle
But we wanted the news to be
the place where you read all

01:18:08.746 --> 01:18:10.796 A:middle
of the stories from your
favorite publications

01:18:11.246 --> 01:18:12.976 A:middle

introducing Subscriptions.

01:18:16.676 --> 01:18:19.916 A:middle
So now, you can read every

01:18:19.916 --> 01:18:21.506 A:middle
like National Geographic,
newspaper--

01:18:21.506 --> 01:18:26.596 A:middle
newspapers like the Wall Street
Journal right inside of news.

01:18:26.946 --> 01:18:28.516 A:middle
And in addition to
subscriptions,

01:18:28.516 --> 01:18:30.896 A:middle
we're bringing breaking

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Eddy.

01:18:53.226 --> 01:18:56.816 A:middle
It's just some fantastic
new designs.

01:18:56.976 --> 01:19:00.216 A:middle
Now, on to number
eight and it's HomeKit.

01:18:56.976 --> 01:19:00.216 A:middle
Now, on to number
eight and it's HomeKit.

01:19:00.716 --> 01:19:03.316 A:middle
You know, before we announce
HomeKit two years ago,

01:19:03.316 --> 01:19:06.896 A:middle
the home accessory space
was a mess of incompatible

01:19:06.896 --> 01:19:10.496 A:middle
and insecure protocols and
accessories that required you

01:19:10.496 --> 01:19:13.526 A:middle
to download a separate app
that you needed to learn just

01:19:13.526 --> 01:19:16.276 A:middle
to control each individual
accessory.

01:19:16.306 --> 01:19:19.456 A:middle
But with HomeKit, we've
been changing all that.

01:19:19.516 --> 01:19:22.336 A:middle
We're making sure that your
home automation products work

01:19:22.336 --> 01:19:25.246 A:middle
together easily and securely.

01:19:25.526 --> 01:19:27.726 A:middle
And this year, we've
rounded out the set

01:19:27.726 --> 01:19:29.926 A:middle
of accessory types
supported by HomeKit

01:19:29.926 --> 01:19:31.906 A:middle
to include important
new categories

01:19:32.316 --> 01:19:34.526 A:middle
like cameras and door locks.

01:19:34.906 --> 01:19:38.406 A:middle
And in fact, essentially
every major maker

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:40.756 A:middle
of home accessories has shipping

01:19:40.756 --> 01:19:42.976 A:middle
or has announced
support for HomeKit.

01:19:42.976 --> 01:19:46.216 A:middle
And home builders are
getting on board as well.

01:19:46.216 --> 01:19:49.536 A:middle
Some of the biggest builders
of homes here in United States

01:19:49.726 --> 01:19:51.796 A:middle
and in China are now
building new homes

01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:53.456 A:middle
with HomeKit built right in.

01:19:53.456 --> 01:19:55.886 A:middle
So you can move in and just
start controlling your home.

01:19:55.886 --> 01:20:01.096 A:middle
But you know, this year,
we're taking the next big step

01:19:55.886 --> 01:20:01.096 A:middle
But you know, this year,
we're taking the next big step

01:20:02.056 --> 01:20:04.736 A:middle
for HomeKit and iOS in the home.

01:20:05.346 --> 01:20:07.986 A:middle
We're building on
the HomeKit framework

01:20:09.126 --> 01:20:11.916 A:middle
with a great new app
what we call Home.

01:20:12.356 --> 01:20:13.866 A:middle
It's right on your
iOS home screen.

[ Applause ]

01:20:17.876 --> 01:20:20.456 A:middle
Now when you launch
the Home app,

01:20:20.456 --> 01:20:23.406 A:middle
you get to see your own
personalized wallpaper

01:20:23.406 --> 01:20:25.506 A:middle
and all of your accessories.

01:20:25.506 --> 01:20:26.736 A:middle
No matter who are
they're made by

01:20:26.966 --> 01:20:28.406 A:middle
and you can control
them so easily.

01:20:28.406 --> 01:20:30.426 A:middle
If you want to turn on the
light, of course, just tap it.

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:34.006 A:middle
If you want to adjust the
dimmer, we'll just press

01:20:34.006 --> 01:20:35.906 A:middle
in a little harder and slide

01:20:35.906 --> 01:20:38.096 A:middle
and you can adjust the
dimmer just like that.

01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:41.106 A:middle
So you can tap, tap, tap
across all the accessories

01:20:41.106 --> 01:20:42.676 A:middle
in your home, but sometimes,

01:20:42.846 --> 01:20:44.926 A:middle
you'd like to trigger a
change to all of them.

01:20:44.926 --> 01:20:46.686 A:middle
And for that, we have
something we call Scenes.

01:20:47.096 --> 01:20:49.886 A:middle
So for instance, if you
want to get ready for bed,

01:20:49.936 --> 01:20:52.906 A:middle
you can tap Good Night.

01:20:52.906 --> 01:20:54.846 A:middle
You'll see they'll close
the living room shades,

01:20:54.926 --> 01:20:58.416 A:middle
lock the front door, adjust the
thermostat, all in one step.

01:20:59.036 --> 01:21:01.556 A:middle
Now Siri knows how to
interact with Scenes as well.

01:20:59.036 --> 01:21:01.556 A:middle
Now Siri knows how to
interact with Scenes as well.

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:04.216 A:middle
So in the morning, you
say good morning to Siri.

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:08.716 A:middle
Well Siri can automatically
get your home all ready for you

01:21:08.716 --> 01:21:12.106 A:middle
for the day and you can also
control your accessories

01:21:12.106 --> 01:21:13.566 A:middle
without launching an app at all

01:21:13.566 --> 01:21:15.906 A:middle
because HomeKit is
actually built right

01:21:15.906 --> 01:21:16.996 A:middle
in to control center.

01:21:17.216 --> 01:21:19.526 A:middle
Swipe up control
center, you can swipe

01:21:19.526 --> 01:21:22.686 A:middle
over to see your home
controls and which is to tap,

01:21:22.686 --> 01:21:25.496 A:middle
for instance, open
up your garage door.

01:21:26.146 --> 01:21:27.936 A:middle
Now, HomeKit takes advantage

01:21:28.036 --> 01:21:30.036 A:middle
of our interactive
notifications as well.

01:21:30.036 --> 01:21:32.946 A:middle
So if someone rings the doorbell
for instance, you can tap in

01:21:33.006 --> 01:21:35.856 A:middle
and actually get a live feed
of your front door camera,

01:21:36.506 --> 01:21:38.226 A:middle
talk to them on the
Intercom if you want

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:39.816 A:middle
and even unlock the door,

01:21:39.816 --> 01:21:42.556 A:middle
all right from the lock
screen of your iPhone.

01:21:43.366 --> 01:21:44.576 A:middle
Now, yeah.

01:21:50.486 --> 01:21:53.176 A:middle
Now since your Apple TV is
always on, always plugged in,

01:21:53.176 --> 01:21:55.506 A:middle
and always on the network
in your home, it can serve

01:21:55.636 --> 01:21:57.716 A:middle
as a secure point
for remote access

01:21:57.716 --> 01:21:59.566 A:middle
and automation within your home.

01:22:00.066 --> 01:22:02.896 A:middle
So when you're on the go,
you can actually access all

01:22:02.896 --> 01:22:05.786 A:middle
of your accessories,
securely end to end encrypted

01:22:05.786 --> 01:22:09.256 A:middle
and you can setup automation
like Geofences so that

01:22:09.256 --> 01:22:11.606 A:middle
when you roll into your
driveway, you can make sure

01:22:11.606 --> 01:22:14.456 A:middle
that the garage door will
open, the lights will turn on

01:22:14.456 --> 01:22:16.356 A:middle
and maybe even the hot tub
will start up in the back

01:22:16.416 --> 01:22:17.876 A:middle

It's also fantastic
on the iPad as well.

01:22:26.546 --> 01:22:27.846 A:middle
So many people like
using the iPad

01:22:27.846 --> 01:22:30.656 A:middle
as the ultimate home control
device whether they're mounted

01:22:30.656 --> 01:22:32.606 A:middle
on the wall or on
the coffee table.

01:22:32.606 --> 01:22:35.786 A:middle
And of course, there's
nothing beating the remote

01:22:35.786 --> 01:22:37.896 A:middle
that you always have with
you right on your wrist,

01:22:37.896 --> 01:22:39.166 A:middle
the Apple Watch, it comes

01:22:39.166 --> 01:22:41.776 A:middle

like this and we wonder
what the heck it's about.

01:23:17.296 --> 01:23:19.986 A:middle
And unfortunately, in China,
this can be a real problem

01:23:19.986 --> 01:23:22.056 A:middle
where there's a lot
of voice mail spam.

01:23:22.566 --> 01:23:24.616 A:middle
So now, we're supporting
an extension API

01:23:24.996 --> 01:23:28.666 A:middle
where third parties like
Tencent can provide information

01:23:28.666 --> 01:23:31.746 A:middle
automatically to tell you
a possible phone spam.

01:23:31.866 --> 01:23:33.586 A:middle

super useful for a lot

so it remembers how you
like to call each person

01:24:17.056 --> 01:24:19.696 A:middle
and you can access them
that way with just a tap.

01:24:21.116 --> 01:24:23.926 A:middle
So we've been working
with our partner Cisco

01:24:24.326 --> 01:24:27.656 A:middle
on elevating mobility
in the enterprise.

01:24:27.876 --> 01:24:30.666 A:middle
And now using our
VoiP API combined

01:24:30.846 --> 01:24:34.116 A:middle
with their Cisco Spark
app, it's never been easier

01:24:34.116 --> 01:24:36.726 A:middle
to use your iPhone with
work because in addition

01:24:36.726 --> 01:24:40.196 A:middle
to receiving calls made to
your personal cell number,

01:24:40.526 --> 01:24:43.376 A:middle
you also can receive calls
made to your work number right

01:24:43.376 --> 01:24:46.676 A:middle
from your iPhone whether you're
at your desk or on the go.

01:24:46.676 --> 01:24:49.386 A:middle
It's really handy
and that's Phone.

So next, number 10 and this
one is a doozy, it's Messages.

01:24:56.006 --> 01:25:01.006 A:middle
So next, number 10 and this
one is a doozy, it's Messages.

01:25:01.616 --> 01:25:05.186 A:middle
Now Messages is the most
frequently used app on iOS

01:25:05.316 --> 01:25:07.176 A:middle
and people love sharing things

01:25:07.176 --> 01:25:09.666 A:middle
with Messages whether
it's photos or links

01:25:09.726 --> 01:25:12.256 A:middle
to their favorite websites,
but they look like this

01:25:12.336 --> 01:25:14.886 A:middle
but not any longer because
now we have rich links.

01:25:15.296 --> 01:25:18.316 A:middle
So when you share links, you
get artwork from the website,

01:25:18.936 --> 01:25:20.606 A:middle
extracted titles,
it's really great.

01:25:21.236 --> 01:25:23.806 A:middle
And it's especially awesome when
you get to share with things

01:25:23.806 --> 01:25:25.656 A:middle
like video because
they can play right

01:25:25.656 --> 01:25:28.236 A:middle
in line inside the transcript.

01:25:29.526 --> 01:25:30.496 A:middle
Look at that guy go.

01:25:32.046 --> 01:25:35.816 A:middle
Now, of course, we love
using our camera to share

01:25:35.816 --> 01:25:39.426 A:middle
and we've made the camera
better than ever in Messages.

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:40.736 A:middle
Now when you bring
up the camera,

01:25:41.166 --> 01:25:43.406 A:middle
you immediately see what's
right in front of your camera.

01:25:43.406 --> 01:25:45.296 A:middle
Like someone in marketing
thought, that's what someone

01:25:45.296 --> 01:25:46.746 A:middle
who sees when they bring
up with their camera.

over and see your family.

01:25:54.016 --> 01:25:56.796 A:middle
It's such an incongruous
set of images.

01:25:57.886 --> 01:26:02.926 A:middle
So, you can tap those and insert
them right into your transcript.

01:25:57.886 --> 01:26:02.926 A:middle
So, you can tap those and insert
them right into your transcript.

01:26:03.636 --> 01:26:04.486 A:middle
It's really convenient.

01:26:04.486 --> 01:26:06.516 A:middle
Now people really love Emoji

01:26:06.966 --> 01:26:10.706 A:middle
and now we made them
three times bigger

01:26:10.706 --> 01:26:12.976 A:middle
in the transcript
which is fantastic.

we're providing emoji

as you type, super handy.

01:26:26.766 --> 01:26:28.806 A:middle
But, you know, sometimes
you've typed the whole message

01:26:28.806 --> 01:26:30.046 A:middle
and you realize at the end,

01:26:30.046 --> 01:26:32.056 A:middle
you're totally lacking
an emojification.

01:26:32.406 --> 01:26:34.416 A:middle
And so we've provided
the solution.

01:26:34.416 --> 01:26:35.896 A:middle
When you tap on the
emoji button,

01:26:36.266 --> 01:26:38.876 A:middle
we'll highlight all the
emojifiable words here

01:26:39.146 --> 01:26:42.746 A:middle

So, these are some great
new features in Messages.

01:27:02.496 --> 01:27:04.856 A:middle
But you know, we wanted to
do something more fundamental

01:27:04.856 --> 01:27:07.956 A:middle
with messaging because today
no matter what you say,

01:27:08.976 --> 01:27:10.576 A:middle
it's always the same bubble.

01:27:10.576 --> 01:27:14.856 A:middle
It always-- this comes across
the same way, but no longer

01:27:15.446 --> 01:27:17.836 A:middle
because now we have
Bubble effects.

01:27:18.136 --> 01:27:21.976 A:middle
So if you want to say it
loud, you can say it loud.

01:27:22.796 --> 01:27:25.156 A:middle
And if you want to
say it more gently,

01:27:25.156 --> 01:27:28.216 A:middle
well now you can
do that as well.

01:27:30.786 --> 01:27:33.316 A:middle
And, you know, sometimes
you want to get

01:27:33.316 --> 01:27:34.446 A:middle
across something personal.

01:27:35.126 --> 01:27:37.766 A:middle
An Invisible ink gives
you the way to do that.

01:27:38.176 --> 01:27:40.276 A:middle
So you can just slide your
finger across the bubble

01:27:40.276 --> 01:27:44.856 A:middle
and clear away the message like
that and it's a really great way

01:27:44.856 --> 01:27:47.316 A:middle
to share a surprise,
a little scared

01:27:47.316 --> 01:27:48.246 A:middle
to see what's behind that.

01:27:48.646 --> 01:27:51.736 A:middle
You can just slide across.

01:27:53.796 --> 01:27:56.896 A:middle

nothing more personal

than your own handwriting.

who just got to a graduation.

01:29:35.806 --> 01:29:40.046 A:middle
So let's write her back
and say give her my love

01:29:40.736 --> 01:29:45.326 A:middle
and tell her I said
happy graduation day.

01:29:46.466 --> 01:29:48.176 A:middle

01:29:48.176 --> 01:29:50.536 A:middle
for the perfect emoji
to tack on the end.

01:29:50.626 --> 01:29:53.576 A:middle
But now, when I tap on
the emoji button to switch

01:29:53.576 --> 01:29:56.856 A:middle
to the emoji keyboard,
words throughout my message

01:29:56.856 --> 01:29:59.376 A:middle
that can be swap for emoji
or automatically highlighted

01:29:59.376 --> 01:30:00.936 A:middle
and all I have to do
is tap to replace them.

and all I have to do
is tap to replace them.

to let her know how I feel
about it, using tap X,

as double tapping

And I'm going to send this
using a bubble effect.

hold on the send button.

01:31:17.056 --> 01:31:20.046 A:middle

let her know how I'm feeling.

highlights from Messages,

but you know, we thought when
it comes to expressing yourself

that there was so much more
we could do if we could tap

01:35:48.606 --> 01:35:52.246 A:middle
in to all of the creativity
of all of you developers,

01:35:52.846 --> 01:35:55.326 A:middle

With the iMessage apps, iMessage
has an app drawer with all

of your iMessage apps, you
can tap the plus and get

01:36:09.996 --> 01:36:12.186 A:middle
to the App Store
and find other apps.

01:36:12.416 --> 01:36:13.356 A:middle
You download them, of course.

01:36:13.696 --> 01:36:14.716 A:middle
They're here in your drawer.

01:36:14.716 --> 01:36:17.166 A:middle
And there's so many different
kinds of apps you can create.

01:36:17.636 --> 01:36:21.196 A:middle
From things like stickers,
an artist can create stickers

01:36:21.196 --> 01:36:23.216 A:middle
as well without even
writing any code.

01:36:23.456 --> 01:36:26.166 A:middle
But for developers who do want
to write code, they have access

01:36:26.166 --> 01:36:30.206 A:middle
to the full iOS SDK including
access to the camera,

01:36:30.516 --> 01:36:34.266 A:middle
so you can incredible animated
effects with apps like JibJab.

01:36:34.596 --> 01:36:37.796 A:middle
You can accomplish more
sophisticated tasks as well

01:36:37.796 --> 01:36:39.766 A:middle
like payment with
Square Cash, allowing you

through the messages thread.

Now I can respond
with text of course,

can just bring up my app drawer

01:37:12.386 --> 01:37:14.226 A:middle
and I can get to all

including some great stickers.

these Mickey stickers.

We can see that they're
all animated.

I can actually look
through them like this.

I can swipe between my stickers,
so maybe some from "Inside Out".

01:37:29.536 --> 01:37:30.866 A:middle
Here some from "Finding Dory".

01:37:30.866 --> 01:37:35.406 A:middle

drop it right in just like that.

And now, here I received another
photo and the great thing

01:37:40.726 --> 01:37:43.946 A:middle
about stickers is you can
actually peel them off

01:37:43.986 --> 01:37:45.356 A:middle
and attach them to bubbles.

01:37:45.636 --> 01:37:46.946 A:middle

if I could just take
the sun over here.

01:37:49.136 --> 01:37:50.996 A:middle
Maybe put that up
there on the corner

01:37:51.386 --> 01:37:55.926 A:middle
and then maybe a little
seal off here on the side.

for lunch after the keynote."

actually with an iMessage app.

01:38:09.086 --> 01:38:12.116 A:middle

and he's placing an order

that we're all collaborating

like one as well.

Now, iOS 10 is a fantastic
release for our users.

01:40:42.346 --> 01:40:45.256 A:middle
It's also a gigantic
release for our developers.

01:40:45.256 --> 01:40:46.046 A:middle
When you think about it,

01:40:46.106 --> 01:40:49.186 A:middle
experiences like the lock
screen with notifications.

01:40:49.456 --> 01:40:55.286 A:middle
The phone, maps, messages,
every major area of iOS now open

01:40:55.286 --> 01:40:58.076 A:middle
to developers and so
many other options.

01:40:58.506 --> 01:41:00.786 A:middle
But, you know, all
of this great work

But, you know, all
of this great work

01:41:01.156 --> 01:41:04.576 A:middle
in iOS 10 would be
meaningless to us if it came

01:41:04.576 --> 01:41:06.756 A:middle
at the expense of your privacy.

01:41:07.936 --> 01:41:13.066 A:middle
And so, in every feature that
we do, we carefully consider how

01:41:13.066 --> 01:41:14.286 A:middle
to protect your privacy.

01:41:14.916 --> 01:41:18.246 A:middle
With apps like FaceTime
and Messages and HomeKit,

01:41:18.326 --> 01:41:23.096 A:middle
we make sure to use end to end
encryption by default and always

01:41:23.296 --> 01:41:24.606 A:middle
to protect your communication.

01:41:24.606 --> 01:41:29.166 A:middle
And when it comes to performing
advanced deep learning

01:41:29.166 --> 01:41:32.306 A:middle
and artificial intelligence
analysis of your data,

01:41:32.626 --> 01:41:35.176 A:middle
we're doing it on device
using the incredible power

01:41:35.176 --> 01:41:37.316 A:middle
of the silicon on your
iPhone and your Mac,

01:41:38.046 --> 01:41:41.176 A:middle
keeping your personal
data under your control.

01:41:41.576 --> 01:41:44.496 A:middle
And when you do do searches on
the internet maybe for a route

01:41:44.606 --> 01:41:47.976 A:middle
and maps or a search for
information in Spotlight,

01:41:48.676 --> 01:41:50.696 A:middle
we don't build any
user profiles.

01:41:51.826 --> 01:41:54.646 A:middle
Now, of course one of
the important tools

01:41:54.646 --> 01:41:58.136 A:middle
in making software more
intelligent is to spot patterns

01:41:58.136 --> 01:42:00.756 A:middle
on how multiple users
are using their devices.

01:41:58.136 --> 01:42:00.756 A:middle
on how multiple users
are using their devices.

01:42:01.076 --> 01:42:03.736 A:middle
For instance, you might want to
know what new words are trending

01:42:03.736 --> 01:42:07.516 A:middle
so you could offer them up more
readily in a QuickType keyboard.

01:42:08.546 --> 01:42:12.196 A:middle
Well, differential privacy is
a research topic in the area

01:42:12.196 --> 01:42:17.006 A:middle
of statistics and data analytics
that uses hashing, subsampling

01:42:17.006 --> 01:42:19.106 A:middle
and noise injection
to enable this kind

01:42:19.106 --> 01:42:22.626 A:middle
of crowd-sourced learning
while keeping the information

01:42:22.626 --> 01:42:25.116 A:middle
of each individual user
completely private.

01:42:25.116 --> 01:42:28.056 A:middle
Now, Apple has been doing
some super important work

01:42:28.056 --> 01:42:31.896 A:middle
in this area to enable
differential privacy

01:42:31.896 --> 01:42:36.226 A:middle
to be deployed at a scale and
we brought in the professor

01:42:36.256 --> 01:42:38.866 A:middle
and researcher who
literally co-wrote the book

01:42:38.866 --> 01:42:42.076 A:middle
on differential privacy for a
quick peek at what we were doing

01:42:42.426 --> 01:42:45.046 A:middle
and he described the
work as groundbreaking.

01:42:45.766 --> 01:42:46.626 A:middle
He went on to say

01:42:46.626 --> 01:42:49.306 A:middle
that incorporating
differential privacy broadly

01:42:49.306 --> 01:42:53.296 A:middle
into Apple's technology is
visionary and positions Apple

Now, as we said earlier,
an important part

01:45:23.606 --> 01:45:27.836 A:middle
of making this platform so
capable is our developers.

01:45:28.626 --> 01:45:32.176 A:middle

01:45:37.426 --> 01:45:40.356 A:middle
Swift is a powerful and
intuitive programming language

01:45:40.616 --> 01:45:44.976 A:middle

01:46:12.296 --> 01:46:16.426 A:middle
Now, we wanted everyone to
use Swift so we released it

01:46:16.586 --> 01:46:19.196 A:middle
as open source in
December and since then,

01:46:19.196 --> 01:46:21.186 A:middle
the adoption has been amazing.

It's already the number one
language project on GitHub.

Swift is powerful but it's also
simple and it's approachable.

The solution here, and I
know you've all got this,

01:50:32.846 --> 01:50:35.696 A:middle
is that I need to repeat
that block of code four times

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:38.656 A:middle
to get Byte around all
four sides of the world.

01:50:39.086 --> 01:50:41.466 A:middle
