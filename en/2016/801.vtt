00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:31.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Caroline
Cranfill and I'm a designer

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:33.276 A:middle
and production manager
here at Apple.

00:00:33.936 --> 00:00:37.546 A:middle
Today, I'm excited to talk
to you about some principles

00:00:37.836 --> 00:00:39.446 A:middle
about inclusive design.

00:00:39.976 --> 00:00:43.776 A:middle
When you put so much hard work
and creativity into an app,

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:46.576 A:middle
you really want it
to reach people.

00:00:47.226 --> 00:00:50.586 A:middle
But ultimately, everyone
will experience your app

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:54.466 A:middle
in their own way and if you
think about the millions

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.666 A:middle
of people who could
use your app,

00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.956 A:middle
you have to consider how
diverse their perspectives are.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:05.176 A:middle
Some people are just learning
how to interact with technology.

00:01:07.126 --> 00:01:10.946 A:middle
Others are digital natives
who are completely comfortable

00:01:11.226 --> 00:01:12.846 A:middle
with the latest and greatest.

00:01:13.276 --> 00:01:16.906 A:middle
And there's some who are just
trying to get comfortable

00:01:16.906 --> 00:01:18.466 A:middle
with the new way to communicate.

00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:22.466 A:middle
And some will have
cultural backgrounds

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.136 A:middle
that are very different
from yours.

00:01:24.646 --> 00:01:28.946 A:middle
And some will interact with your
app with assistive technology

00:01:29.176 --> 00:01:30.946 A:middle
like a Bluetooth
Braille Display.

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:35.516 A:middle
So when you're trying to
ship an app, it always feels

00:01:35.516 --> 00:01:38.786 A:middle
like there isn't enough time and
there aren't enough resources

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.856 A:middle
and it only gets worse the
closer you get to the end.

00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:45.726 A:middle
So that's why it's important to
plan to make your app inclusive

00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:48.656 A:middle
as early as possible in
the development cycle.

00:01:49.486 --> 00:01:52.896 A:middle
The problem is that early in
the cycle, everyone just wants

00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:55.506 A:middle
to talk about the cool
feature ideas they have.

00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:59.106 A:middle
So you need to convince your
team to do the right thing.

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:02.796 A:middle
And here are some statistics
that will persuade them

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:02.796 A:middle
And here are some statistics
that will persuade them

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:05.736 A:middle
to make inclusiveness
a high level feature.

00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:11.606 A:middle
Tim Cook recently announced
that 67 percent of Apple sales

00:02:11.856 --> 00:02:13.906 A:middle
in the second quarter
were international.

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:17.166 A:middle
Your app needs to be
inclusive and flexible

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:21.026 A:middle
to reach this huge market of
people with diverse backgrounds.

00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:29.046 A:middle
Worldwide, 285 million people
are blind or have low vision.

00:02:29.496 --> 00:02:32.076 A:middle
That's like half the
population of North America.

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:38.556 A:middle
Over one billion people live
with some kind of disability.

00:02:39.086 --> 00:02:42.256 A:middle
That's one out of every
seven people on the planet.

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:46.916 A:middle
Now disability and diversity
may not be the first things you

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.616 A:middle
think about when you think
about user experience.

00:02:50.106 --> 00:02:53.196 A:middle
But these numbers make it
clear, these are the people

00:02:53.246 --> 00:02:57.396 A:middle
that use your app and creating
designs that work for them is

00:02:57.396 --> 00:02:59.506 A:middle
at the heart of the
user experience.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:04.286 A:middle
So, how can you make
your apps more inclusive?

00:03:04.876 --> 00:03:08.376 A:middle
Fortunately, there are a
small number of key principles

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:10.316 A:middle
that I have found to be helpful.

00:03:11.606 --> 00:03:14.286 A:middle
If you incorporate these
principles into your process,

00:03:14.656 --> 00:03:17.556 A:middle
you will have more informed
designs from the beginning.

00:03:17.976 --> 00:03:21.216 A:middle
And in the end, your app
will not only work better

00:03:21.216 --> 00:03:24.096 A:middle
for more people, but
you may also save time

00:03:24.096 --> 00:03:25.456 A:middle
on localization and QA.

00:03:26.576 --> 00:03:29.086 A:middle
So today, I'm going
to share some concepts

00:03:29.086 --> 00:03:32.366 A:middle
that I found eye opening and now
keep in mind when I'm designing.

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:36.616 A:middle
I'll discuss how to use
typography to maintain hierarchy

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:38.076 A:middle
in different localizations.

00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:42.016 A:middle
I'll show you why layouts
need to be dynamically built

00:03:42.276 --> 00:03:44.006 A:middle
to accommodate translation
lengths,

00:03:44.176 --> 00:03:46.216 A:middle
screen sizes and dynamic type.

00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:50.996 A:middle
And we'll discuss emotions
and legibility considerations

00:03:51.246 --> 00:03:53.076 A:middle
when making design
choices with color.

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:56.986 A:middle
And we'll go over certain
cultural sensitivities

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:57.966 A:middle
around iconography.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:08.386 A:middle
So first, we'll talk about
the need impactful typography

00:04:08.386 --> 00:04:10.806 A:middle
for everyone regardless
of language.

00:04:11.426 --> 00:04:14.846 A:middle
Because the most fundamental
objective of app design is

00:04:14.846 --> 00:04:16.786 A:middle
to communicate information
clearly

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:19.106 A:middle
and we largely do
that with typography.

00:04:19.736 --> 00:04:22.576 A:middle
So let's look at a quick
design exercise together.

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:27.276 A:middle
One of the ways you know
what is most important is

00:04:27.276 --> 00:04:29.546 A:middle
by using basic typographic
treatments

00:04:29.706 --> 00:04:33.106 A:middle
and compositional elements to
give visual cues of hierarchy.

00:04:33.966 --> 00:04:37.486 A:middle
You can use extra space between
different pieces of information

00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:40.726 A:middle
or try different font sizes.

00:04:42.276 --> 00:04:45.636 A:middle
Or you can explore typographic
styles like font weights

00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:51.176 A:middle
or character styles like
capitalization or italics.

00:04:51.886 --> 00:04:55.546 A:middle
Or start adding color
and before you know it,

00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:57.236 A:middle
you have so many good options.

00:04:57.626 --> 00:05:00.736 A:middle
And at this stage, it's
an excellent opportunity


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:57.626 --> 00:05:00.736 A:middle
And at this stage, it's
an excellent opportunity

00:05:00.976 --> 00:05:05.156 A:middle
to preview your favorite options
in other languages you are going

00:05:05.156 --> 00:05:08.276 A:middle
to localize in because
you want all localizations

00:05:08.276 --> 00:05:11.326 A:middle
to have this same impact
as your original intention.

00:05:12.276 --> 00:05:15.546 A:middle
In this example, the hierarchy
isn't as strong in the title

00:05:15.546 --> 00:05:17.976 A:middle
and subtitle of the
Chinese localization

00:05:18.216 --> 00:05:21.346 A:middle
because the Chinese writing
system doesn't have the concept

00:05:21.516 --> 00:05:22.796 A:middle
of upper and lowercase.

00:05:23.036 --> 00:05:28.606 A:middle
In the second design, the title
additionally has a larger font

00:05:28.606 --> 00:05:30.836 A:middle
size and color from the subtitle

00:05:31.076 --> 00:05:33.696 A:middle
which helps maintain a
clear hierarchy in Chinese.

00:05:34.226 --> 00:05:36.536 A:middle
So out of my two favorites,

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:39.856 A:middle
this second design is
the most robust choice

00:05:40.116 --> 00:05:41.456 A:middle
because it creates hierarchy

00:05:41.456 --> 00:05:43.626 A:middle
through using two
typographic treatments,

00:05:43.916 --> 00:05:47.466 A:middle
both localizations can support,
which is font size and color.

00:05:47.886 --> 00:05:51.556 A:middle
I've found that once a design
is going to be translated

00:05:51.556 --> 00:05:54.716 A:middle
into multiple languages,
having two to three levels

00:05:54.716 --> 00:05:57.286 A:middle
of change will be
more inclusive just

00:05:57.286 --> 00:06:00.216 A:middle
in case a treatment isn't
applicable in certain languages.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:57.286 --> 00:06:00.216 A:middle
in case a treatment isn't
applicable in certain languages.

00:06:01.036 --> 00:06:03.396 A:middle
And sometimes, designing
with constraints

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:06.166 A:middle
like these can help come up
with a better end solution

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:06.876 A:middle
for everyone.

00:06:08.156 --> 00:06:10.156 A:middle
Here's another example
at Airbnb.

00:06:10.156 --> 00:06:15.006 A:middle
They use font size, color, and
extra space between information

00:06:15.236 --> 00:06:17.806 A:middle
to maintain hierarchy
across localizations.

00:06:18.306 --> 00:06:22.766 A:middle
And so now for you to have
more background knowledge

00:06:22.766 --> 00:06:25.436 A:middle
and feel informed to
design for other languages,

00:06:25.436 --> 00:06:29.086 A:middle
I want to dive a little
deeper about a few topics.

00:06:30.506 --> 00:06:33.466 A:middle
First, it's important to
remember that around the world,

00:06:33.506 --> 00:06:36.616 A:middle
we speak different languages
and use different alphabets.

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:39.826 A:middle
So, I want to introduce
you to some writing systems

00:06:39.906 --> 00:06:41.436 A:middle
that you may not
be familiar with

00:06:41.896 --> 00:06:44.946 A:middle
and how hierarchy can be
lost if you aren't aware

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:46.116 A:middle
of their typographic support.

00:06:47.396 --> 00:06:50.486 A:middle
So everyone here knows this
writing system called Latin.

00:06:51.356 --> 00:06:53.286 A:middle
But you may not be
familiar with characters

00:06:53.286 --> 00:06:56.056 A:middle
in the extended Latin
character set such as these.

00:06:56.506 --> 00:06:58.716 A:middle
And you really might
not be familiar

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:01.476 A:middle
with all ten writing
systems that are used


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:01.476 A:middle
with all ten writing
systems that are used

00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:04.906 A:middle
in over forty languages or
localizations that we ship.

00:07:05.386 --> 00:07:09.786 A:middle
A few typographic things that
you might not be aware of is

00:07:09.786 --> 00:07:12.846 A:middle
that some writing systems do
not have the concept of upper

00:07:12.936 --> 00:07:14.726 A:middle
and lowercase as I
mentioned earlier.

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:20.176 A:middle
Also, the same subset does
not have an italic appearance

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:23.306 A:middle
and it's not in good
practice to force a slant

00:07:23.306 --> 00:07:24.576 A:middle
on these writing systems.

00:07:26.176 --> 00:07:29.396 A:middle
So now you need to know
that different fonts

00:07:29.426 --> 00:07:32.306 A:middle
for these writing systems
have different numbers

00:07:32.306 --> 00:07:33.286 A:middle
of font weights.

00:07:34.826 --> 00:07:36.606 A:middle
Currently these are
the font weights

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:39.256 A:middle
in the system font,
San Francisco.

00:07:39.256 --> 00:07:43.616 A:middle
But you can see that the system
fonts for all writing systems

00:07:43.616 --> 00:07:46.826 A:middle
at the moment do not have the
same number of font weights.

00:07:47.836 --> 00:07:52.156 A:middle
So this means your designs using
extreme weights may fall back

00:07:52.156 --> 00:07:52.966 A:middle
to the reduced set.

00:07:52.966 --> 00:07:55.336 A:middle
And this can be unexpected

00:07:55.336 --> 00:07:57.496 A:middle
and sometimes lose
hierarchy or emphasis.

00:07:57.706 --> 00:08:01.506 A:middle
In the next consideration,
I would like to talk


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:57.706 --> 00:08:01.506 A:middle
In the next consideration,
I would like to talk

00:08:01.506 --> 00:08:05.306 A:middle
about is using larger text sizes
because they are more universal

00:08:05.306 --> 00:08:07.776 A:middle
between languages and
user capabilities.

00:08:08.396 --> 00:08:09.646 A:middle
So let's start with
a good question

00:08:09.646 --> 00:08:11.056 A:middle
which is, "What is too small?"

00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:15.516 A:middle
Maybe everyone here can
see this bottom letter

00:08:15.516 --> 00:08:16.656 A:middle
on this enormous screen.

00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:19.996 A:middle
But on a smaller device,
it'll be too hard to read.

00:08:20.646 --> 00:08:22.766 A:middle
Legibility is really
going to depend

00:08:22.766 --> 00:08:24.586 A:middle
on what device you are targeting

00:08:24.866 --> 00:08:27.246 A:middle
because the standard viewing
distances are different.

00:08:27.936 --> 00:08:30.676 A:middle
But, even if the
letters are legible,

00:08:30.816 --> 00:08:33.716 A:middle
it doesn't mean it's going to
be good for reading content.

00:08:34.546 --> 00:08:37.366 A:middle
Let's look at a non-Latin
writing system like Chinese.

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:41.535 A:middle
It gets harder to read
at a higher number

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:45.816 A:middle
because rendering dense writing
systems too small can reduce the

00:08:45.816 --> 00:08:47.156 A:middle
clarity of letter forms.

00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:50.236 A:middle
The meaning can be
misconstrued or lost

00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:51.856 A:middle
because the strokes
blend together.

00:08:52.436 --> 00:08:57.156 A:middle
You want people to read their
content easily and effortlessly.

00:08:57.596 --> 00:09:01.206 A:middle
So leaning toward larger font
sizes will make the content more


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:57.596 --> 00:09:01.206 A:middle
So leaning toward larger font
sizes will make the content more

00:09:01.206 --> 00:09:02.346 A:middle
readable for everyone.

00:09:02.916 --> 00:09:06.516 A:middle
Now one more thing
about typography.

00:09:07.126 --> 00:09:10.386 A:middle
Some writing systems are
considered to be tall

00:09:10.626 --> 00:09:12.616 A:middle
because they have
tall letter forms.

00:09:14.116 --> 00:09:16.736 A:middle
As you might have noticed in
the writing system overview,

00:09:16.736 --> 00:09:19.586 A:middle
some of the examples
have extra marks

00:09:19.636 --> 00:09:20.936 A:middle
that we don't use in English.

00:09:21.356 --> 00:09:24.646 A:middle
These are call diacritics,
vowel marks, or tone marks

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:27.406 A:middle
and sometimes they're
extremely high or low.

00:09:28.376 --> 00:09:31.956 A:middle
For example, in this Thai font
it can have ascenders much

00:09:32.036 --> 00:09:33.616 A:middle
higher than Latin characters.

00:09:35.476 --> 00:09:37.986 A:middle
And in these Arabic
and Hindi fonts,

00:09:38.236 --> 00:09:41.426 A:middle
they have descenders much
lower than Latin characters.

00:09:43.146 --> 00:09:45.046 A:middle
And you should also be aware

00:09:45.276 --> 00:09:47.416 A:middle
that in some code
implementations,

00:09:47.736 --> 00:09:50.566 A:middle
characters that draw
outside those ascender

00:09:50.566 --> 00:09:52.876 A:middle
and descender boundaries
of a font

00:09:52.876 --> 00:09:55.456 A:middle
and text views can
be cut off if clip

00:09:55.486 --> 00:09:57.316 A:middle
to bounds is true for the label.

00:09:57.616 --> 00:10:00.976 A:middle
This should be off,
because this is bad.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:57.616 --> 00:10:00.976 A:middle
This should be off,
because this is bad.

00:10:01.586 --> 00:10:04.916 A:middle
Missing marks can change the
meaning of the word entirely.

00:10:06.276 --> 00:10:08.736 A:middle
So, also in design comps,

00:10:08.736 --> 00:10:11.646 A:middle
you should avoid assuming
fixed heights for texts

00:10:11.946 --> 00:10:13.956 A:middle
because the letter
form is going to vary

00:10:13.956 --> 00:10:15.136 A:middle
in different writing systems.

00:10:16.446 --> 00:10:19.386 A:middle
So you might be thinking how
does this affect my layouts?

00:10:19.636 --> 00:10:21.226 A:middle
So let me show you
a quick example

00:10:21.226 --> 00:10:23.496 A:middle
of how labels will
adjust automatically

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:25.676 A:middle
for these tall writing
systems and code.

00:10:27.276 --> 00:10:29.306 A:middle
If you look at this
composition consisting

00:10:29.306 --> 00:10:32.326 A:middle
of three separate
Latin text-size labels,

00:10:32.846 --> 00:10:35.756 A:middle
and you can see in a tall
writing system it requires a

00:10:35.756 --> 00:10:38.096 A:middle
larger line height
to avoid clipping.

00:10:38.726 --> 00:10:40.236 A:middle
And here they are, side by side.

00:10:40.466 --> 00:10:44.536 A:middle
And you can see that Thai text
is longer and it's been allowed

00:10:44.536 --> 00:10:45.916 A:middle
to expand appropriately.

00:10:46.316 --> 00:10:49.546 A:middle
And it's important that you
don't restrict the height

00:10:49.546 --> 00:10:52.066 A:middle
of the view so this
expansion can happen

00:10:52.536 --> 00:10:55.406 A:middle
because letter forms could
overlap or be illegible.

00:10:55.956 --> 00:10:58.966 A:middle
And later, we'll explain how to
make further make these spaces

00:10:58.966 --> 00:11:01.346 A:middle
between labels increase
dynamically


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.966 --> 00:11:01.346 A:middle
between labels increase
dynamically

00:11:01.346 --> 00:11:02.836 A:middle
to accommodate dynamic type.

00:11:04.026 --> 00:11:07.956 A:middle
So some things to remember
about typography that you need

00:11:07.956 --> 00:11:11.996 A:middle
to make sure designs will retain
the same meaningful purpose

00:11:11.996 --> 00:11:14.786 A:middle
in other languages by
preserving hierarchy,

00:11:15.086 --> 00:11:18.756 A:middle
by choosing universal character
styles, or by having two

00:11:18.756 --> 00:11:22.026 A:middle
to three levels of change
in case one isn't applicable

00:11:22.026 --> 00:11:23.306 A:middle
in one of the localizations.

00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:28.366 A:middle
Use font sizes that will
be easy to read across all

00:11:28.366 --> 00:11:31.686 A:middle
of your localizations and
capabilities of the people

00:11:31.686 --> 00:11:34.006 A:middle
who will use your app.

00:11:34.006 --> 00:11:37.636 A:middle
And don't restrict drawing of
views to their bounding boxes.

00:11:38.446 --> 00:11:40.866 A:middle
So now we've looked at a
little bit of typography.

00:11:41.096 --> 00:11:44.316 A:middle
For more information about
typography, be sure to check

00:11:44.316 --> 00:11:47.266 A:middle
out my friend Antonio's
session tomorrow morning called

00:11:47.266 --> 00:11:49.966 A:middle
Typography and Fonts
for even more details

00:11:49.966 --> 00:11:52.626 A:middle
on typographic treatments
and layout considerations.

00:11:53.726 --> 00:11:55.696 A:middle
But now, let's talk
about dynamic layouts.

00:11:56.396 --> 00:12:01.506 A:middle
We've talked about the
appearance of words from all


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:56.396 --> 00:12:01.506 A:middle
We've talked about the
appearance of words from all

00:12:01.506 --> 00:12:02.996 A:middle
over the world, but
now let's talk

00:12:02.996 --> 00:12:05.446 A:middle
about how they come
together in layouts.

00:12:05.956 --> 00:12:08.616 A:middle
An Auto Layout can really
help you implement these

00:12:08.616 --> 00:12:11.446 A:middle
considerations, but I'm
not going to go into detail

00:12:11.446 --> 00:12:13.286 A:middle
about Auto Layout
in this session.

00:12:13.696 --> 00:12:18.126 A:middle
I want to focus on why having
flexibly built layouts helps

00:12:18.126 --> 00:12:19.996 A:middle
on so many different levels.

00:12:20.456 --> 00:12:22.096 A:middle
It helps with localization,

00:12:22.386 --> 00:12:26.256 A:middle
adapting to different screen
sizes and for visual impairments

00:12:26.256 --> 00:12:27.696 A:middle
when type is able to scale.

00:12:28.376 --> 00:12:31.296 A:middle
So first, let's see how
dynamic layouts help

00:12:31.296 --> 00:12:33.006 A:middle
with varying translation
lengths.

00:12:33.476 --> 00:12:37.386 A:middle
As crazy it sounds, the
shorter the English words are,

00:12:37.576 --> 00:12:39.766 A:middle
the longer the translations
are going to be.

00:12:40.196 --> 00:12:42.746 A:middle
The word edit in English
is four characters

00:12:43.106 --> 00:12:44.896 A:middle
but in Russian, it's
twice the size.

00:12:45.356 --> 00:12:47.876 A:middle
Just kidding, it's
thirteen characters long.

00:12:49.226 --> 00:12:52.116 A:middle
If an English word is less
than ten characters long,

00:12:52.116 --> 00:12:54.986 A:middle
the translation can be
three times longer or more.

00:12:56.606 --> 00:13:01.316 A:middle
A seemingly concise English
phrase may be two times longer


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:56.606 --> 00:13:01.316 A:middle
A seemingly concise English
phrase may be two times longer

00:13:01.316 --> 00:13:02.316 A:middle
in another language.

00:13:02.876 --> 00:13:09.056 A:middle
And an English sentence
can be 1.3 times or longer

00:13:09.276 --> 00:13:11.116 A:middle
and might need to
wrap to more lines.

00:13:12.486 --> 00:13:15.966 A:middle
So this variation
means that the amount

00:13:15.966 --> 00:13:19.256 A:middle
of maximum text lines should
not be strictly defined

00:13:19.526 --> 00:13:21.516 A:middle
and text should be
allowed to reflow

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:23.296 A:middle
by having a flexible layout.

00:13:23.926 --> 00:13:27.866 A:middle
You need to allow enough space
for translations to expand,

00:13:28.006 --> 00:13:31.156 A:middle
especially if there's no other
place to see the words in full.

00:13:31.896 --> 00:13:33.296 A:middle
You would hate for the end

00:13:33.296 --> 00:13:37.506 A:middle
of a very important
message to be lost.

00:13:38.746 --> 00:13:42.436 A:middle
Titles and other key texts
of apps must not be truncated

00:13:42.436 --> 00:13:46.746 A:middle
because it can lose meaning
or functionality of the app.

00:13:47.016 --> 00:13:49.836 A:middle
So those expansion
stats were eye-opening

00:13:49.836 --> 00:13:51.436 A:middle
and I hope it is for you too.

00:13:51.776 --> 00:13:55.526 A:middle
I can't stress enough that
layouts need to be overspecified

00:13:55.896 --> 00:13:58.096 A:middle
for what you aren't
seeing in the language

00:13:58.096 --> 00:14:00.156 A:middle
that you are designing in.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.096 --> 00:14:00.156 A:middle
that you are designing in.

00:14:00.426 --> 00:14:01.616 A:middle
Let me show you an example

00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:04.736 A:middle
of a dynamic layout
using Auto Layout --

00:14:04.736 --> 00:14:06.216 A:middle
looks like in a few
different languages.

00:14:07.416 --> 00:14:09.726 A:middle
Here's this What's
New in Photos screen

00:14:09.856 --> 00:14:11.156 A:middle
that was created
at Speed Dynamic.

00:14:12.416 --> 00:14:15.016 A:middle
In Chinese, it's actually
shorter than English

00:14:15.246 --> 00:14:18.406 A:middle
and in German it's much longer

00:14:18.406 --> 00:14:21.516 A:middle
and would start a Scroll
View on an iPhone SE.

00:14:22.786 --> 00:14:25.416 A:middle
And here is Thai with
the tall letter forms

00:14:25.416 --> 00:14:26.526 A:middle
and extra line height.

00:14:27.006 --> 00:14:32.296 A:middle
And here's Arabic which is also
tall and a right-to-left layout.

00:14:33.146 --> 00:14:37.116 A:middle
It's best to look at each
screen after implementation

00:14:37.116 --> 00:14:39.816 A:middle
in each language that
you're going to localize

00:14:39.816 --> 00:14:41.776 A:middle
in so you aren't
missing something

00:14:41.776 --> 00:14:43.486 A:middle
that will create
a bad experience.

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:46.976 A:middle
Accommodating translation
should be the next step

00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:48.786 A:middle
into making your app inclusive

00:14:48.786 --> 00:14:50.926 A:middle
and it will have
immediate thank you

00:14:50.926 --> 00:14:53.126 A:middle
from the people who
use your app.

00:14:53.266 --> 00:14:57.226 A:middle
But I have one more reason
why you need dynamic layouts,

00:14:57.676 --> 00:14:59.076 A:middle
and that's Dynamic Type.

00:14:59.676 --> 00:15:03.146 A:middle
This feature might be one of
the most important features


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.676 --> 00:15:03.146 A:middle
This feature might be one of
the most important features

00:15:03.146 --> 00:15:05.906 A:middle
that you could add to your
app if you haven't already.

00:15:07.126 --> 00:15:09.736 A:middle
In settings, you have the
ability to scale text.

00:15:10.266 --> 00:15:14.196 A:middle
This enables a broad audience to
personalize their devices and be

00:15:14.196 --> 00:15:16.466 A:middle
in control of their
own legibility.

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.276 A:middle
But it also allows them

00:15:18.276 --> 00:15:20.316 A:middle
to choose how they
consume information.

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:24.056 A:middle
Small text sizes may
produce dense content.

00:15:24.316 --> 00:15:27.086 A:middle
And larger text sizes
could be more focused.

00:15:27.746 --> 00:15:29.916 A:middle
This is a highly used feature.

00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:33.466 A:middle
In fact, who here uses a text
size feature on their devices?

00:15:34.886 --> 00:15:37.976 A:middle
Nice. So let's get
a great consistent

00:15:38.046 --> 00:15:39.576 A:middle
across all of our apps.

00:15:40.756 --> 00:15:43.916 A:middle
And you also might not be aware,
but in accessibility settings,

00:15:44.146 --> 00:15:48.176 A:middle
low vision people can get even
larger sizes for body copy.

00:15:48.436 --> 00:15:51.176 A:middle
And here is Ulysses.

00:15:51.426 --> 00:15:54.286 A:middle
They do a great job scaling
their UIs dynamically.

00:15:58.326 --> 00:16:01.456 A:middle
So, how do I specify a
design to be dynamic?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.326 --> 00:16:01.456 A:middle
So, how do I specify a
design to be dynamic?

00:16:02.646 --> 00:16:05.926 A:middle
First you start by specifying
different text styles

00:16:05.926 --> 00:16:09.896 A:middle
for semantically distinct blocks
of text such as title, headline,

00:16:09.896 --> 00:16:13.106 A:middle
body, etc. for the platform
you're developing for.

00:16:14.086 --> 00:16:17.606 A:middle
This gives ample variety to
achieve a nice layout hierarchy

00:16:17.996 --> 00:16:20.166 A:middle
and today I've got a
present for all of you

00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:21.776 A:middle
when making designs
with text styles.

00:16:22.406 --> 00:16:24.806 A:middle
The font size, leading,
and tracking values

00:16:24.806 --> 00:16:26.836 A:middle
for each style is now published

00:16:26.836 --> 00:16:28.866 A:middle
on the iOS Human
Interface Guidelines

00:16:29.146 --> 00:16:30.506 A:middle
in the typography section.

00:16:30.876 --> 00:16:34.956 A:middle
And you will be able to download
a working Photoshop file.

00:16:35.516 --> 00:16:40.916 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:41.416 --> 00:16:43.446 A:middle
Okay, so, let's go into detail,

00:16:43.506 --> 00:16:46.346 A:middle
I'm focused for a
minute on an iOS example.

00:16:46.956 --> 00:16:49.796 A:middle
These are the font styles
at the sizes they appear

00:16:49.796 --> 00:16:51.996 A:middle
at for the default
text size setting.

00:16:52.866 --> 00:16:56.746 A:middle
When the user slides the
slider smaller and larger,

00:16:57.456 --> 00:16:59.506 A:middle
these other columns
are the sizes

00:16:59.556 --> 00:17:02.196 A:middle
that the fonts will appear at.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.556 --> 00:17:02.196 A:middle
that the fonts will appear at.

00:17:02.376 --> 00:17:05.826 A:middle
You can see how the font sizes
get smaller and larger, both up

00:17:05.826 --> 00:17:08.386 A:middle
and down in text
styles, and left to right

00:17:08.386 --> 00:17:09.766 A:middle
in the text size slider.

00:17:10.236 --> 00:17:13.476 A:middle
And here's an iOS
10 mail message.

00:17:13.476 --> 00:17:15.816 A:middle
And I'm going to show you some
behind-the-scenes information

00:17:16.086 --> 00:17:18.915 A:middle
about how to use text styles
to make this design dynamic.

00:17:20.376 --> 00:17:23.796 A:middle
First, you will need to assign
a text style to each text area.

00:17:24.675 --> 00:17:28.256 A:middle
The sender and the subject
are the most important labels

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:31.156 A:middle
and will be headlined so
they're prominent and bold.

00:17:32.486 --> 00:17:35.766 A:middle
The To field and the time stamp
are less important details

00:17:35.956 --> 00:17:37.006 A:middle
and will be subhead.

00:17:37.486 --> 00:17:40.826 A:middle
And then the message
body will be body.

00:17:41.516 --> 00:17:43.676 A:middle
Then the next step,
you will need

00:17:43.676 --> 00:17:47.296 A:middle
to add a baseline measurement
to express the relationship

00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:50.296 A:middle
of each label to other
elements around it.

00:17:51.016 --> 00:17:54.426 A:middle
And in the dynamic type
APIs, you'll use these values

00:17:54.466 --> 00:17:58.406 A:middle
to create a ratio to scale
the spaces proportionately

00:17:58.696 --> 00:18:00.906 A:middle
to the font size as it changes.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.696 --> 00:18:00.906 A:middle
to the font size as it changes.

00:18:01.406 --> 00:18:03.886 A:middle
These are not fixed
baseline-to-baseline

00:18:03.886 --> 00:18:04.476 A:middle
measurements.

00:18:06.116 --> 00:18:08.696 A:middle
The bottom space under
the type also needs

00:18:08.726 --> 00:18:10.726 A:middle
to be specified dynamically

00:18:10.936 --> 00:18:13.996 A:middle
so that the text cluster will
remain vertically centered

00:18:14.056 --> 00:18:18.306 A:middle
in the header and the
other measurements will

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.146 A:middle
follow similarly.

00:18:20.486 --> 00:18:22.506 A:middle
The next step, you'll specify

00:18:22.506 --> 00:18:25.046 A:middle
or enforce the standard
layout margins.

00:18:25.406 --> 00:18:28.906 A:middle
It's important to at least use
the standard width from UIKit

00:18:29.166 --> 00:18:32.266 A:middle
because the actual value is
different on different devices.

00:18:32.636 --> 00:18:36.776 A:middle
You want to be consistent
with other apps.

00:18:36.986 --> 00:18:38.926 A:middle
And lastly, we'll
add some padding

00:18:38.926 --> 00:18:40.636 A:middle
between horizontal elements.

00:18:41.126 --> 00:18:44.506 A:middle
So now together, with the
text styles, baseline ratios,

00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:47.166 A:middle
margins, and padding,
the layout is ready

00:18:47.166 --> 00:18:48.366 A:middle
to be coded dynamically.

00:18:48.826 --> 00:18:50.646 A:middle
And so now, let's watch
this design scale.

00:18:54.286 --> 00:18:57.426 A:middle
So, ta-da, this is the
mail message screen,

00:18:57.426 --> 00:18:59.576 A:middle
growing from large to
extra, extra large.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:00.626 --> 00:19:03.686 A:middle
There's also another legibility
feature that you will get

00:19:03.686 --> 00:19:07.366 A:middle
for free if you use text styles
and that's called bold text.

00:19:08.136 --> 00:19:11.586 A:middle
This helps people who would
otherwise have a difficult time

00:19:11.586 --> 00:19:13.006 A:middle
reading lightweight fonts.

00:19:13.896 --> 00:19:16.056 A:middle
And additionally,
it also adjusts

00:19:16.056 --> 00:19:17.406 A:middle
for tall writing systems.

00:19:18.536 --> 00:19:23.456 A:middle
So sometimes, with the 12.9-inch
iPad Pro, paragraphs of texts,

00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:27.156 A:middle
or large blocks of texts,
can often appear too wide

00:19:27.156 --> 00:19:28.396 A:middle
for the reading experience

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:32.096 A:middle
if the layout margins were
coded as fixed values.

00:19:33.336 --> 00:19:35.546 A:middle
So when you're reading
a long line length,

00:19:35.996 --> 00:19:37.886 A:middle
it's hard for your
eye to jump back

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:39.416 A:middle
to the beginning
of the next line.

00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:44.486 A:middle
So in iOS 9, we introduced the
readable content guide property

00:19:44.486 --> 00:19:48.766 A:middle
of UIView to respect a suitable
line length for reading based

00:19:48.766 --> 00:19:51.646 A:middle
on the size of the font

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:54.286 A:middle
which makes the margins
dynamic instead of fixed.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:58.796 A:middle
And now, so the margins adjust

00:19:58.796 --> 00:19:59.976 A:middle
when the text size
setting changes.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:00.976 --> 00:20:03.856 A:middle
This way, the line
length remains favorable

00:20:03.856 --> 00:20:06.526 A:middle
for each font size.

00:20:06.636 --> 00:20:08.686 A:middle
Also, layouts need
to be further dynamic

00:20:08.686 --> 00:20:11.506 A:middle
for right-to-left writing
systems such as Arabic

00:20:11.506 --> 00:20:14.366 A:middle
and Hebrew because they
read from the right side

00:20:14.366 --> 00:20:15.296 A:middle
of the screen to the left.

00:20:15.996 --> 00:20:20.016 A:middle
These languages require
the UI to be mirrored.

00:20:20.016 --> 00:20:20.626 A:middle
Here's Tweetbot.

00:20:20.816 --> 00:20:24.156 A:middle
They've done a great job at
their right-to-left layout.

00:20:24.976 --> 00:20:28.326 A:middle
If using Auto Layout's leading
and trailing attributes,

00:20:28.326 --> 00:20:30.986 A:middle
the flow and elements
will easily mirror.

00:20:31.506 --> 00:20:33.496 A:middle
However, it's important
to make sure

00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:35.146 A:middle
that some things do not mirror.

00:20:36.176 --> 00:20:36.916 A:middle
Like numerals.

00:20:37.616 --> 00:20:40.536 A:middle
They are presented
left-to-right even in the middle

00:20:40.536 --> 00:20:42.266 A:middle
of right-to-left phrases.

00:20:42.986 --> 00:20:51.026 A:middle
You should not mirror phone
numbers, clocks, music notes,

00:20:52.426 --> 00:20:56.246 A:middle
graphs, and video
playback controls.

00:20:56.706 --> 00:20:59.916 A:middle
Video progress sliders
still increase from the left

00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:03.616 A:middle
to the right and rewind always
points the triangles facing left


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:03.616 A:middle
to the right and rewind always
points the triangles facing left

00:21:03.766 --> 00:21:05.066 A:middle
and fast-forward to the right.

00:21:05.896 --> 00:21:09.796 A:middle
And images do not need to be
mirrored unless there is a sense

00:21:09.796 --> 00:21:12.956 A:middle
of direction or design
composition elements tying

00:21:12.956 --> 00:21:14.776 A:middle
to other parts of
the user interface.

00:21:15.276 --> 00:21:18.056 A:middle
So now let's internationalize
an example together

00:21:18.376 --> 00:21:20.216 A:middle
so you can see how this
all comes together.

00:21:21.506 --> 00:21:24.846 A:middle
Here's a step one, two,
three, and an onboarding flow

00:21:24.846 --> 00:21:25.936 A:middle
in a hypothetical app.

00:21:26.526 --> 00:21:28.106 A:middle
If we were going
to localize this

00:21:28.106 --> 00:21:31.276 A:middle
for right-to-left languages,
first we would mirror steps one

00:21:31.276 --> 00:21:33.896 A:middle
through three with step
one starting on the right.

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:37.856 A:middle
And then of course,
translate the text and numbers

00:21:38.136 --> 00:21:41.266 A:middle
by making them localizable
labels instead

00:21:41.266 --> 00:21:42.676 A:middle
of being baked into the art.

00:21:43.546 --> 00:21:47.206 A:middle
But here, the story of the
images seems to be pointing

00:21:47.206 --> 00:21:49.656 A:middle
in the opposite direction
as the numbered steps.

00:21:50.126 --> 00:21:54.246 A:middle
So we would want to mirror each
image separately so the story

00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:56.166 A:middle
of the images follows the steps.

00:21:56.676 --> 00:21:59.666 A:middle
However, we should not
mirror the checkmark


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:00.066 --> 00:22:03.606 A:middle
because checkmarks
are written the same.

00:22:03.686 --> 00:22:06.546 A:middle
And now, the onboarding
flow would feel natural

00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:08.086 A:middle
for right-to-left languages.

00:22:08.646 --> 00:22:13.166 A:middle
So some things to remember
about dynamic type is

00:22:13.516 --> 00:22:16.686 A:middle
that translation lengths are
going to vary, both shorter

00:22:16.686 --> 00:22:20.536 A:middle
and longer, than the
language you are designing in.

00:22:20.816 --> 00:22:23.826 A:middle
Dynamic Type is an
awesome, highly used feature

00:22:23.826 --> 00:22:25.186 A:middle
that allows scalable type.

00:22:25.876 --> 00:22:29.586 A:middle
And reability margins help
keep columns and areas of type

00:22:29.826 --> 00:22:31.726 A:middle
at nice readable line lengths.

00:22:32.556 --> 00:22:35.766 A:middle
And Arabic and Hebrew will
require the UI to mirror.

00:22:37.176 --> 00:22:38.806 A:middle
So now we've looked
at dynamic layouts

00:22:38.806 --> 00:22:40.776 A:middle
and I hope your apps
will look great

00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:42.616 A:middle
to these size changes
and new languages.

00:22:43.156 --> 00:22:46.176 A:middle
There are new additions to the
APIs that will make it easier

00:22:46.176 --> 00:22:49.076 A:middle
to implement, so check out
these other great talks

00:22:49.106 --> 00:22:50.106 A:middle
for more information.

00:22:58.136 --> 00:23:02.036 A:middle
and Making Apps Adaptive, Part

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:58.136 --> 00:23:02.036 A:middle
and Making Apps Adaptive, Part
2, will give you a summary

00:23:02.036 --> 00:23:05.496 A:middle
of the new Dynamic Type
APIs and What's New

00:23:05.496 --> 00:23:08.376 A:middle
in International User Interfaces
highlights new support

00:23:08.376 --> 00:23:11.116 A:middle
for handling right-to-left
images with asset catalogs.

00:23:11.596 --> 00:23:14.726 A:middle
But now, let's talk about color.

00:23:17.086 --> 00:23:20.506 A:middle
Color is another
fundamental design element.

00:23:21.036 --> 00:23:23.746 A:middle
There's a -- and there's a lot
to consider when choosing colors

00:23:23.746 --> 00:23:26.666 A:middle
for your app because
they will bring emotions

00:23:26.726 --> 00:23:27.696 A:middle
to the experience.

00:23:28.656 --> 00:23:30.126 A:middle
So first, it's important

00:23:30.126 --> 00:23:33.126 A:middle
to recognize what
emotions colors will mean

00:23:33.316 --> 00:23:36.246 A:middle
to your particular
audience in your context.

00:23:36.896 --> 00:23:38.696 A:middle
So let's talk about
a few meanings

00:23:38.696 --> 00:23:40.666 A:middle
of the three most
popular colors.

00:23:41.696 --> 00:23:44.916 A:middle
Surveys have told us that blue
might be considered the most

00:23:45.036 --> 00:23:46.736 A:middle
favored color around the world.

00:23:47.306 --> 00:23:50.596 A:middle
And the second most popular
color varies in countries

00:23:50.596 --> 00:23:53.506 A:middle
but is usually green or red.

00:23:55.466 --> 00:23:57.206 A:middle
So first let's talk about blue.

00:23:57.626 --> 00:23:59.496 A:middle
Why does everybody
like blue so much?

00:23:59.556 --> 00:24:03.656 A:middle
I mean, blue has a short
wavelength on the spectrum


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.556 --> 00:24:03.656 A:middle
I mean, blue has a short
wavelength on the spectrum

00:24:03.826 --> 00:24:06.606 A:middle
and actually makes it
less work on us to see.

00:24:07.216 --> 00:24:10.606 A:middle
And our eyes are trained to
see the skies as generally blue

00:24:10.956 --> 00:24:13.746 A:middle
because the short wavelengths
are scattered more efficiently

00:24:13.746 --> 00:24:14.516 A:middle
by the molecules.

00:24:15.056 --> 00:24:17.516 A:middle
FYI, that's why the sky's blue.

00:24:18.006 --> 00:24:21.926 A:middle
But also seeing some colors
releases calming chemicals

00:24:21.926 --> 00:24:24.486 A:middle
in your body and lowers
the blood pressure.

00:24:25.586 --> 00:24:27.336 A:middle
However, universally,

00:24:27.456 --> 00:24:30.236 A:middle
some shades of blue
also portray sadness

00:24:30.236 --> 00:24:33.206 A:middle
and loneliness likely
stemming from an association

00:24:33.416 --> 00:24:35.056 A:middle
with the vast and
ominous oceans.

00:24:36.946 --> 00:24:38.576 A:middle
So now, let's talk about green.

00:24:39.386 --> 00:24:42.246 A:middle
It has a wide range of
symbolic associations.

00:24:42.966 --> 00:24:46.426 A:middle
In the western cultures, it's
heavily marketed as go green,

00:24:46.426 --> 00:24:49.226 A:middle
live healthy, and
reduce, reuse, recycle,

00:24:49.526 --> 00:24:52.046 A:middle
as a natural eco-friendly
way of life.

00:24:53.486 --> 00:24:56.626 A:middle
In Ireland, green commemorates
the Patron Saint of Ireland

00:24:56.626 --> 00:24:57.636 A:middle
on Saint Patrick's Day

00:24:58.036 --> 00:24:59.966 A:middle
and is also known throughout
the world as a lucky color.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:01.976 --> 00:25:04.776 A:middle
Green is also a universal
color for safety.

00:25:05.246 --> 00:25:08.686 A:middle
It's used in traffic light
systems and road signs all

00:25:08.686 --> 00:25:11.376 A:middle
over the world to indicate
that it is safe to proceed.

00:25:12.706 --> 00:25:14.936 A:middle
So now, let's talk about red.

00:25:15.446 --> 00:25:18.126 A:middle
It's pretty consistent around
the world that it stirs

00:25:18.126 --> 00:25:20.986 A:middle
up both similar positive
and negative meanings.

00:25:22.316 --> 00:25:25.016 A:middle
Red has a long wavelength
on the spectrum

00:25:25.286 --> 00:25:27.496 A:middle
which grabs our attention
easily.

00:25:28.626 --> 00:25:32.336 A:middle
Therefore, in many parts of
the world, red is a symbol

00:25:32.336 --> 00:25:34.106 A:middle
of revolution and conflict.

00:25:35.656 --> 00:25:38.156 A:middle
It exudes passion and love.

00:25:39.466 --> 00:25:43.286 A:middle
And to most Asian cultures, red
means happiness, prosperity,

00:25:43.286 --> 00:25:46.006 A:middle
and good luck because
of the association

00:25:46.006 --> 00:25:46.936 A:middle
with the Lunar New Year.

00:25:47.776 --> 00:25:49.496 A:middle
And it's also worn at weddings.

00:25:50.076 --> 00:25:52.516 A:middle
In fact, red is so
positive here,

00:25:52.866 --> 00:25:56.786 A:middle
that the Chinese stock
market uses red to mean gains

00:25:56.936 --> 00:25:58.276 A:middle
and green to mean losses.

00:25:58.976 --> 00:26:04.416 A:middle
And the next color consideration
is color blindness.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.976 --> 00:26:04.416 A:middle
And the next color consideration
is color blindness.

00:26:04.676 --> 00:26:06.256 A:middle
And you need to be aware

00:26:06.426 --> 00:26:09.156 A:middle
that color blindness affects
more people than you think.

00:26:09.576 --> 00:26:13.706 A:middle
It's actually one in 12
men and one in 200 women.

00:26:13.996 --> 00:26:15.726 A:middle
That's almost 5 percent

00:26:15.726 --> 00:26:17.716 A:middle
of the total population
of the whole world.

00:26:18.786 --> 00:26:22.106 A:middle
And all of these popular
preferred colors have

00:26:22.106 --> 00:26:24.056 A:middle
implications to color
blind people.

00:26:24.656 --> 00:26:26.206 A:middle
It's not that these are --

00:26:26.206 --> 00:26:30.106 A:middle
these colors are confused with
each other, but it's how much

00:26:30.106 --> 00:26:32.936 A:middle
of blue, red, and green
they have difficulty seeing

00:26:32.936 --> 00:26:33.826 A:middle
in all colors.

00:26:34.576 --> 00:26:36.356 A:middle
For one kind of color blindness,

00:26:36.476 --> 00:26:39.226 A:middle
this color palette may
look similar to this.

00:26:40.276 --> 00:26:42.646 A:middle
This is why our platforms
have settings

00:26:42.676 --> 00:26:46.176 A:middle
to differentiate key information
without color if needed.

00:26:47.186 --> 00:26:49.706 A:middle
Like here in mail
settings, you have the choice

00:26:49.756 --> 00:26:54.266 A:middle
between an orange dot or an
orange flag for mail flagging

00:26:55.196 --> 00:26:57.766 A:middle
because if you are color
blind, you may not be able

00:26:57.766 --> 00:27:00.796 A:middle
to tell the difference from
the orange flagging dot


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:57.766 --> 00:27:00.796 A:middle
to tell the difference from
the orange flagging dot

00:27:00.796 --> 00:27:02.086 A:middle
with the blue and red dot.

00:27:02.576 --> 00:27:06.216 A:middle
So the additional shape option
is good for people who need it.

00:27:06.746 --> 00:27:12.056 A:middle
And the next topic is about
having high-color contrasts

00:27:12.056 --> 00:27:14.766 A:middle
for legibility between
backgrounds and text.

00:27:16.036 --> 00:27:18.566 A:middle
Contrast is important
to test in your apps

00:27:18.566 --> 00:27:22.036 A:middle
because you want people who
may have contrast sensitivities

00:27:22.296 --> 00:27:25.746 A:middle
as well as situational
impairments like bright sunlight

00:27:25.746 --> 00:27:28.556 A:middle
or wearing sunglasses to
be able to use your app.

00:27:29.176 --> 00:27:31.166 A:middle
And to find what
is high contrast,

00:27:31.486 --> 00:27:34.176 A:middle
you need to calculate
the luminosity ratio

00:27:34.286 --> 00:27:38.906 A:middle
between two colors or one way
of roughly testing contrast

00:27:39.226 --> 00:27:42.866 A:middle
without calculation is to
turn your file into grayscale.

00:27:43.796 --> 00:27:47.236 A:middle
You can quickly see if the
colors will have enough contrast

00:27:47.236 --> 00:27:49.976 A:middle
with each other in your app.

00:27:49.976 --> 00:27:52.606 A:middle
And soon, on the iOS
Human Interface Guidelines

00:27:52.606 --> 00:27:54.636 A:middle
in the resources
section, you'll be able

00:27:54.636 --> 00:27:57.956 A:middle
to download a helpful tool
to calculate color contrast

00:27:57.956 --> 00:28:02.166 A:middle
by using RGB values and it
will also tell you if you're


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.956 --> 00:28:02.166 A:middle
by using RGB values and it
will also tell you if you're

00:28:02.166 --> 00:28:04.786 A:middle
in compliance with common
accessibility guidelines

00:28:04.786 --> 00:28:06.366 A:middle
for different text
sizes and weights.

00:28:07.376 --> 00:28:09.766 A:middle
But you can also use
numerous online contrast

00:28:09.996 --> 00:28:10.946 A:middle
ratio calculators.

00:28:12.016 --> 00:28:15.236 A:middle
If we calculate the contrast
ratio for this purple

00:28:15.236 --> 00:28:18.396 A:middle
and orange, it was
found to be 1.5 to 1.

00:28:19.146 --> 00:28:21.066 A:middle
That is not in compliance
with --

00:28:21.096 --> 00:28:23.226 A:middle
because it is a very low ratio.

00:28:23.656 --> 00:28:28.306 A:middle
In fact, 1 to 1 is the
lowest ratio you can have.

00:28:28.586 --> 00:28:29.946 A:middle
Let's look at another example

00:28:29.946 --> 00:28:31.986 A:middle
to see the highest
contrast possible,

00:28:32.446 --> 00:28:34.176 A:middle
and that's between
black and white.

00:28:34.956 --> 00:28:37.696 A:middle
A contrast ratio calculator
finds that the white

00:28:37.696 --> 00:28:40.446 A:middle
and black has a ratio of 21 to 1

00:28:40.766 --> 00:28:45.036 A:middle
and of course it passes
at all text sizes.

00:28:45.036 --> 00:28:47.936 A:middle
Now let's check out some gray
text since it's such a fad.

00:28:49.376 --> 00:28:52.796 A:middle
The ratio comes in at
4.4 to 1 for this gray.

00:28:53.236 --> 00:28:55.226 A:middle
It's okay for large font sizes,

00:28:55.446 --> 00:28:57.826 A:middle
but it's too low for
small text sizes.

00:28:58.176 --> 00:29:01.886 A:middle
When font sizes are small
and have low contrast,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.176 --> 00:29:01.886 A:middle
When font sizes are small
and have low contrast,

00:29:02.096 --> 00:29:05.196 A:middle
your eyes can't distinguish
the shape of the letter forms

00:29:05.236 --> 00:29:06.596 A:middle
to easily read the text.

00:29:07.136 --> 00:29:08.376 A:middle
Let's look at one more gray.

00:29:09.526 --> 00:29:12.726 A:middle
Maybe not on this screen,
but on small devices,

00:29:12.726 --> 00:29:16.486 A:middle
this is really hard to
see, even at large sizes.

00:29:16.806 --> 00:29:20.176 A:middle
That's because the
contrast ratio is 1.9 to 1.

00:29:20.176 --> 00:29:22.656 A:middle
And this fails at
all text sizes.

00:29:23.106 --> 00:29:26.006 A:middle
You wouldn't want your
app to have text or glyphs

00:29:26.006 --> 00:29:29.836 A:middle
at this low contrast if
you want people to see

00:29:29.836 --> 00:29:31.676 A:middle
and be able to use it.

00:29:31.676 --> 00:29:35.336 A:middle
Ideally gray text should be
reserved to indicate disabled

00:29:35.336 --> 00:29:41.216 A:middle
or inactive states rather than
ornamental or decorative style.

00:29:41.216 --> 00:29:43.706 A:middle
Now, have you ever debated
whether you should use white

00:29:43.706 --> 00:29:45.776 A:middle
text or black text on
a color background?

00:29:46.186 --> 00:29:47.076 A:middle
Happens to me all the time.

00:29:47.656 --> 00:29:51.026 A:middle
If we use this calculator,
we can see that white text

00:29:51.026 --> 00:29:54.786 A:middle
on an orange button is a
2.2 to 1 contrast ratio.

00:29:55.206 --> 00:29:58.686 A:middle
And black text on an
orange button is 9.6 to 1.

00:29:59.196 --> 00:30:03.056 A:middle
So in this particular example,
choose black on orange.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.196 --> 00:30:03.056 A:middle
So in this particular example,
choose black on orange.

00:30:03.056 --> 00:30:04.416 A:middle
It's a higher ratio.

00:30:05.246 --> 00:30:08.416 A:middle
Your texts and glyph colors
should be in good contrast

00:30:08.696 --> 00:30:10.976 A:middle
to the background color for
optimal reading experience.

00:30:13.216 --> 00:30:15.186 A:middle
So some things to
remember about color,

00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:19.186 A:middle
some of the most popular colors
can mean different things

00:30:19.186 --> 00:30:19.946 A:middle
around the world.

00:30:21.246 --> 00:30:24.196 A:middle
Additionally, you should
not rely solely on color

00:30:24.196 --> 00:30:27.426 A:middle
to show the difference
between similar shaped objects

00:30:27.456 --> 00:30:28.786 A:middle
that have different meanings.

00:30:29.846 --> 00:30:33.076 A:middle
And you need a high color
contrast between text

00:30:33.076 --> 00:30:34.736 A:middle
and backgrounds for legibility.

00:30:35.296 --> 00:30:37.536 A:middle
And so now we've
looked at color.

00:30:38.276 --> 00:30:39.706 A:middle
Let's talk about iconography.

00:30:42.446 --> 00:30:44.626 A:middle
It's important for you to know

00:30:44.626 --> 00:30:46.926 A:middle
that iconography can
have different meanings

00:30:46.926 --> 00:30:47.726 A:middle
around the world too.

00:30:48.816 --> 00:30:51.276 A:middle
Semiotics shows us
that the language

00:30:51.276 --> 00:30:54.796 A:middle
of visible symbols is
audience and context dependent

00:30:55.106 --> 00:30:58.736 A:middle
and how cultural references
and values shape the message.

00:30:59.176 --> 00:31:01.936 A:middle
For example, to be -- in
order to be multicultural,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.176 --> 00:31:01.936 A:middle
For example, to be -- in
order to be multicultural,

00:31:02.246 --> 00:31:05.646 A:middle
the International Red Cross
has three official symbols

00:31:05.646 --> 00:31:07.066 A:middle
for protection during conflict.

00:31:07.576 --> 00:31:10.526 A:middle
They have the red cross for
predominantly Christian regions,

00:31:11.096 --> 00:31:13.256 A:middle
the red crescent
for Muslim regions,

00:31:13.786 --> 00:31:16.246 A:middle
and the red crystal
as a neutral symbol.

00:31:16.786 --> 00:31:20.566 A:middle
These religious connotations
of these simple symbols,

00:31:20.746 --> 00:31:23.886 A:middle
risk the safety of people in
conflict, so they adopted three.

00:31:24.766 --> 00:31:27.716 A:middle
So, when you design glyphs
and icons, it's important

00:31:27.716 --> 00:31:29.486 A:middle
to remember that different areas

00:31:29.486 --> 00:31:31.946 A:middle
of the world might
associate meaning

00:31:31.946 --> 00:31:33.706 A:middle
with even the simplest
of shapes.

00:31:34.716 --> 00:31:37.636 A:middle
Something as simple as a hand
can have different meanings

00:31:37.636 --> 00:31:38.246 A:middle
around the world.

00:31:38.906 --> 00:31:43.026 A:middle
In most places, it means stop or
requesting a cheerful high five.

00:31:43.776 --> 00:31:47.096 A:middle
But in Hinduism and Buddhism,
it's the hand position

00:31:47.096 --> 00:31:49.256 A:middle
of Abhaya and it means no fear.

00:31:50.416 --> 00:31:54.076 A:middle
However, maybe you wanted to
make a simple design decision

00:31:54.076 --> 00:31:57.716 A:middle
to spread out the fingers
of a palm for better clarity

00:31:57.716 --> 00:31:59.606 A:middle
in a glyph, but an open,

00:31:59.746 --> 00:32:02.996 A:middle
facing palm is actually
offensive in some countries.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.746 --> 00:32:02.996 A:middle
facing palm is actually
offensive in some countries.

00:32:03.306 --> 00:32:04.886 A:middle
And I'm not going to
show you that one today.

00:32:06.746 --> 00:32:11.156 A:middle
Additionally, non-directional
and non-textual icons are going

00:32:11.156 --> 00:32:14.636 A:middle
to be more universal
because it does not rely

00:32:14.896 --> 00:32:16.466 A:middle
on one region's alphabet

00:32:16.676 --> 00:32:19.256 A:middle
or particular cultural
objects' orientation.

00:32:19.496 --> 00:32:22.966 A:middle
For example, iBooks using
an open book instead

00:32:22.966 --> 00:32:25.936 A:middle
of a book showing the binding
which is going to be different

00:32:25.936 --> 00:32:27.146 A:middle
for right-to-left locals.

00:32:28.096 --> 00:32:31.366 A:middle
You don't want to alienate
a group of potential users

00:32:31.366 --> 00:32:33.946 A:middle
because they can't
recognize a letter form

00:32:34.176 --> 00:32:37.626 A:middle
or if something will
feel backward.

00:32:37.626 --> 00:32:39.556 A:middle
Also, sometimes you
create glyphs

00:32:39.556 --> 00:32:40.896 A:middle
that mimic other
parts of the UI.

00:32:40.896 --> 00:32:44.336 A:middle
For example, in right-to-left
settings,

00:32:44.616 --> 00:32:46.776 A:middle
the notification
icon is mirrored

00:32:46.776 --> 00:32:49.726 A:middle
to match the way it appears on
the right-to-left Home screen.

00:32:50.256 --> 00:32:51.756 A:middle
The badge should be on the left

00:32:51.756 --> 00:32:54.526 A:middle
of the glyph representing
a badged icon.

00:32:55.076 --> 00:32:58.636 A:middle
So some things to remember
about icons and glyphs,

00:32:59.076 --> 00:33:01.866 A:middle
iconography can conflict
with cultural norms


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.076 --> 00:33:01.866 A:middle
iconography can conflict
with cultural norms

00:33:02.036 --> 00:33:04.116 A:middle
or symbols can have
different meanings entirely.

00:33:05.126 --> 00:33:09.276 A:middle
Iconography are ideally
non-directional and non-textual.

00:33:10.426 --> 00:33:14.036 A:middle
And iconography should match
UI if the UI was mirrored

00:33:14.066 --> 00:33:15.286 A:middle
for right-to-left languages.

00:33:15.966 --> 00:33:19.956 A:middle
You want the meaning of your
feature or app to be clear

00:33:19.956 --> 00:33:23.536 A:middle
and used, not offensive,
confusing and unused.

00:33:25.336 --> 00:33:30.156 A:middle
Okay, so we've looked at ways in
which your app's UI could change

00:33:30.156 --> 00:33:32.276 A:middle
to be more intuitive
and appropriate

00:33:32.466 --> 00:33:34.296 A:middle
for a culturally
diverse audience,

00:33:34.666 --> 00:33:37.306 A:middle
and in ways in which
your designs can be all

00:33:37.306 --> 00:33:39.346 A:middle
around more assessable
to everyone.

00:33:39.886 --> 00:33:43.666 A:middle
But it's a lot to consider and
sometimes it's hard to know

00:33:43.856 --> 00:33:45.746 A:middle
if you're doing something
that is insensitive.

00:33:46.466 --> 00:33:49.996 A:middle
So what I encourage you to
do is to reach out to people

00:33:50.176 --> 00:33:52.946 A:middle
in the countries you plan to
make your app available in

00:33:53.116 --> 00:33:54.386 A:middle
and ask them for feedback.

00:33:54.726 --> 00:33:57.076 A:middle
Ask them how they
were using your app.

00:33:57.076 --> 00:33:58.946 A:middle
If it feels logical
in their language?

00:33:59.246 --> 00:34:01.266 A:middle
Is everything easy to read?

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.246 --> 00:34:01.266 A:middle
Is everything easy to read?

00:34:01.266 --> 00:34:03.756 A:middle
And then I want you
to ask yourself,

00:34:04.066 --> 00:34:05.906 A:middle
"How can you be more inclusive?"
