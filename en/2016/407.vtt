00:00:27.196 --> 00:00:27.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:29.086 --> 00:00:30.796 A:middle
My name is Susumu Harada.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:32.756 A:middle
I'm an engineer on the
Accessibility Team.

00:00:33.146 --> 00:00:35.166 A:middle
And I'm here today with
my colleague Patti.

00:00:35.576 --> 00:00:39.216 A:middle
And we're really excited to
introduce to you a new tool

00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:43.206 A:middle
that will make it easier than
ever for you to find, diagnose

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:45.906 A:middle
and fix accessibility
issues in your apps.

00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:49.296 A:middle
So, some of you may be
new to accessibility.

00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:51.426 A:middle
So let me quickly go
over what it means

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:54.186 A:middle
to make your app accessible
and some of the issues

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:56.616 A:middle
that you may encounter
as you develop your apps.

00:00:58.336 --> 00:01:01.176 A:middle
So, accessibility
is about making sure


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.336 --> 00:01:01.176 A:middle
So, accessibility
is about making sure

00:01:01.426 --> 00:01:05.446 A:middle
that everyone can enjoy
the products and services

00:01:05.446 --> 00:01:07.346 A:middle
and the great apps
that you all create,

00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:10.876 A:middle
regardless of their abilities.

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:12.816 A:middle
Now, some users may
have difficulty

00:01:12.816 --> 00:01:16.076 A:middle
with their vision
or their hearing.

00:01:16.646 --> 00:01:21.326 A:middle
And some may experience
physical and motor challenges,

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:24.586 A:middle
or cognitive and
learning difficulties.

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:29.586 A:middle
So, to support this
wide diversity of users,

00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:32.886 A:middle
we at Apple have worked
hard to make a number

00:01:32.886 --> 00:01:34.056 A:middle
of assistive technologies

00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:38.056 A:middle
that help augment various users'
abilities, such as VoiceOver

00:01:38.086 --> 00:01:40.656 A:middle
for people with visual
impairments, or Switch control

00:01:40.656 --> 00:01:42.416 A:middle
for people with motor
difficulties.

00:01:42.746 --> 00:01:48.806 A:middle
And we also made sure that these
are available on all devices

00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:51.226 A:middle
across all of our
platforms, from macOS

00:01:51.226 --> 00:01:54.266 A:middle
and iOS to watchOS and tvOS.

00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:59.146 A:middle
And while these assistive
technologies are great,

00:01:59.146 --> 00:02:01.126 A:middle
enabling tools, the heart


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.146 --> 00:02:01.126 A:middle
enabling tools, the heart

00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:03.996 A:middle
of our users' experience are
the great apps that you create.

00:02:04.506 --> 00:02:08.936 A:middle
So to better get a sense
for how your apps interact

00:02:08.936 --> 00:02:11.576 A:middle
with our assistive technologies
and the kinds of issues

00:02:11.576 --> 00:02:14.576 A:middle
that you may run into, let's
take a look at a quick example.

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:18.816 A:middle
So here I have a simple app that
I created called Math Learner.

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:22.326 A:middle
And it just presents a user with
an equation at the top to solve

00:02:22.646 --> 00:02:24.396 A:middle
and four answer buttons
on the bottom.

00:02:24.956 --> 00:02:27.376 A:middle
And the user can tap
on an answer button

00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:29.936 A:middle
and you get a feedback whether
or not the answer is correct.

00:02:30.406 --> 00:02:31.746 A:middle
It's pretty straightforward.

00:02:31.936 --> 00:02:33.546 A:middle
And it looks like its
functioning properly.

00:02:34.176 --> 00:02:38.446 A:middle
But how might a user who is
blind use this application?

00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:44.266 A:middle
So, obviously without any
assistive technology they won't

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:45.366 A:middle
be able to see the screen.

00:02:45.676 --> 00:02:47.076 A:middle
So, it's pretty useless.

00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:51.226 A:middle
But fortunately, they can
use our screen reader called

00:02:51.226 --> 00:02:53.736 A:middle
VoiceOver to have
the information

00:02:53.736 --> 00:02:55.226 A:middle
on the screen read out to them.

00:02:55.386 --> 00:02:58.336 A:middle
And they can use various
gestures to navigate around

00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:00.306 A:middle
and interact with different
controls on the screen.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:00.306 A:middle
and interact with different
controls on the screen.

00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:02.676 A:middle
So, if this app is
fully accessible,

00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:05.706 A:middle
when the user touches on the
screen showing the equation,

00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:09.276 A:middle
VoiceOver will read
out: "5 plus 3 equals."

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:14.606 A:middle
Great. So what does the
assistive technology

00:03:14.606 --> 00:03:16.956 A:middle
like VoiceOver need
from your app in order

00:03:16.956 --> 00:03:18.806 A:middle
to present the interface
in a meaningful way?

00:03:18.806 --> 00:03:21.366 A:middle
So, there are several key
pieces of information.

00:03:21.786 --> 00:03:24.476 A:middle
But first it needs to know

00:03:24.476 --> 00:03:27.396 A:middle
where all the important
elements are on the screen.

00:03:28.836 --> 00:03:31.646 A:middle
And for each of those elements
it needs to know their traits

00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:35.616 A:middle
or their types such as what is a
button, heading or static text.

00:03:36.106 --> 00:03:41.116 A:middle
And finally, it also needs
to know a descriptive label

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:44.476 A:middle
that uniquely identifies that
element so it can be described

00:03:44.506 --> 00:03:46.006 A:middle
to the user in an
understandable way.

00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:51.916 A:middle
So with these key pieces
of information VoiceOver

00:03:51.916 --> 00:03:54.626 A:middle
and other assistive technologies
can present the interface

00:03:54.716 --> 00:03:57.586 A:middle
to the user in a
very usable manner.

00:03:57.586 --> 00:04:02.526 A:middle
And all the accessibility
information is provided


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:57.586 --> 00:04:02.526 A:middle
And all the accessibility
information is provided

00:04:02.526 --> 00:04:04.896 A:middle
by the app through
our accessibility API.

00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:07.596 A:middle
And we at Apple have
worked very hard

00:04:07.666 --> 00:04:10.946 A:middle
to build accessibility support
right into our UI frameworks

00:04:11.406 --> 00:04:14.866 A:middle
so that if you build your apps
using standard controls all

00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:17.305 A:middle
of this accessibility
information will be filled

00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:19.206 A:middle
in for you automatically
by the framer.

00:04:19.206 --> 00:04:22.416 A:middle
And you don't have
to do any extra work.

00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:25.596 A:middle
But of course, your apps
will ultimately contain

00:04:25.596 --> 00:04:26.416 A:middle
custom controls.

00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:28.836 A:middle
And when they do, you
may need to provide some

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:30.736 A:middle
of this accessibility
information yourself.

00:04:31.856 --> 00:04:34.506 A:middle
And if you don't, you might end
up with an inaccessible app.

00:04:35.176 --> 00:04:38.986 A:middle
So let's see what the impact
of that might be like.

00:04:38.986 --> 00:04:41.146 A:middle
So, if I had implemented
that equation view

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:45.136 A:middle
at the top using complete custom
drawing code like CA Layers

00:04:45.136 --> 00:04:48.566 A:middle
or OpenGL, so they don't have
any accessibility information

00:04:48.566 --> 00:04:49.186 A:middle
by default.

00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:51.666 A:middle
So unless I explicitly
provide them,

00:04:52.776 --> 00:04:55.336 A:middle
they might be completely
invisible to VoiceOver

00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:56.656 A:middle
and other assistive
technologies.

00:04:57.176 --> 00:05:00.136 A:middle
And with these four
buttons at the bottom,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:57.176 --> 00:05:00.136 A:middle
And with these four
buttons at the bottom,

00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:03.316 A:middle
if I used custom views
that act like buttons,

00:05:03.706 --> 00:05:06.046 A:middle
but forgot to indicate
their accessibility trait

00:05:06.196 --> 00:05:09.066 A:middle
as being a button,
then VoiceOver

00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:10.786 A:middle
and their users will
have no idea

00:05:10.786 --> 00:05:12.566 A:middle
that they can press on these.

00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:16.066 A:middle
And finally, for the
Help button here,

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:18.876 A:middle
if I implemented it using
custom drawing code,

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:23.616 A:middle
and forgot to supply the
accessibility to the label,

00:05:23.616 --> 00:05:26.126 A:middle
VoiceOver will have no idea
how to describe it to the user.

00:05:26.356 --> 00:05:28.866 A:middle
And the user will have no
idea what that button is for.

00:05:29.936 --> 00:05:32.916 A:middle
So you can see how if you're
missing some key accessibility

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:36.016 A:middle
information the user
experience for someone relying

00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:40.946 A:middle
on assistive technology
could be pretty bad.

00:05:41.076 --> 00:05:42.966 A:middle
So obviously it's very important

00:05:42.966 --> 00:05:46.326 A:middle
to make sure your app is
fully accessible, to make sure

00:05:46.326 --> 00:05:48.216 A:middle
that it has a positive
user experience.

00:05:49.536 --> 00:05:51.206 A:middle
But there's also
another added benefit

00:05:51.206 --> 00:05:52.936 A:middle
to making sure your
app is accessible.

00:05:53.026 --> 00:05:55.646 A:middle
And that is a fully
accessible app --

00:05:56.216 --> 00:05:59.626 A:middle
with a fully accessible app you
can write automated UI tests

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:02.966 A:middle
for it using Xcode's
UI Testing Support.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:02.966 A:middle
for it using Xcode's
UI Testing Support.

00:06:03.836 --> 00:06:06.306 A:middle
And for more information on
how to do that, I encourage you

00:06:06.306 --> 00:06:08.676 A:middle
to check out UI Testing
With Xcode session

00:06:08.676 --> 00:06:10.706 A:middle
from last year's WWDC.

00:06:13.746 --> 00:06:15.506 A:middle
Great. So, how can you make sure

00:06:15.506 --> 00:06:17.576 A:middle
that your app is
providing all the necessary

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:18.756 A:middle
accessibility information?

00:06:19.316 --> 00:06:22.556 A:middle
Well, one method that
we've been recommending is

00:06:22.636 --> 00:06:25.506 A:middle
to use the actual assistive
technologies like VoiceOver

00:06:25.506 --> 00:06:27.266 A:middle
and Switch control
with your apps.

00:06:27.816 --> 00:06:29.876 A:middle
Now, this is still
the ideal method,

00:06:30.176 --> 00:06:33.346 A:middle
since you can mirror the
actual user experience

00:06:33.436 --> 00:06:36.836 A:middle
and also catch usability
issues beyond whether or not

00:06:36.836 --> 00:06:37.966 A:middle
that something is accessible.

00:06:38.976 --> 00:06:41.766 A:middle
But it does require that
you be familiar with how

00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:42.876 A:middle
to use these technologies.

00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:46.376 A:middle
And especially if your app
supports multiple platforms,

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:49.026 A:middle
you might find it quite
challenging to have

00:06:49.066 --> 00:06:51.796 A:middle
to repeatedly deploy your
app on a specific device,

00:06:52.296 --> 00:06:54.766 A:middle
run through it using each of
the assistive technologies

00:06:55.116 --> 00:06:57.706 A:middle
and repeat the process
across each of our platforms.

00:06:58.266 --> 00:07:02.936 A:middle
And all those platforms also
have a number accessibility


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.266 --> 00:07:02.936 A:middle
And all those platforms also
have a number accessibility

00:07:03.066 --> 00:07:04.956 A:middle
settings that the
user can configure

00:07:05.416 --> 00:07:07.646 A:middle
such the Dynamic Type font size.

00:07:08.106 --> 00:07:12.906 A:middle
And you as a developer might
find it a little tedious to have

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:15.696 A:middle
to go and switch back and forth

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:17.596 A:middle
between changing the
accessibility setting,

00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:21.626 A:middle
going back to your app,
verifying its effect on your app

00:07:21.626 --> 00:07:22.666 A:middle
and repeating the process.

00:07:24.086 --> 00:07:25.916 A:middle
So, we've heard all
your feedback.

00:07:26.186 --> 00:07:30.486 A:middle
And today we're very excited
to announce a new, an easier,

00:07:30.486 --> 00:07:32.006 A:middle
and more streamlined alternative

00:07:32.196 --> 00:07:35.846 A:middle
to auditing your apps using the
new Accessibility Inspector.

00:07:39.046 --> 00:07:40.956 A:middle
And in the new Accessibility
Inspector,

00:07:42.026 --> 00:07:43.816 A:middle
with just a single
press of a button,

00:07:44.356 --> 00:07:45.966 A:middle
it can automatically
audit your app

00:07:46.186 --> 00:07:47.666 A:middle
for common accessibility issues.

00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:49.066 A:middle
It's super easy.

00:07:49.196 --> 00:07:52.226 A:middle
And it even suggests to you
how to fix those issues.

00:07:52.816 --> 00:07:57.136 A:middle
And in the Interactive
Inspection mode you can really

00:07:57.136 --> 00:07:59.156 A:middle
easily, point at any
element on your app

00:07:59.156 --> 00:08:01.606 A:middle
and get very detailed
accessibility information


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.156 --> 00:08:01.606 A:middle
and get very detailed
accessibility information

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:02.086 A:middle
about them.

00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:05.666 A:middle
And this works whether your
app is running on a simulator

00:08:05.666 --> 00:08:07.256 A:middle
or on a connected device.

00:08:07.826 --> 00:08:13.796 A:middle
And we also offer a live
preview feature for settings,

00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:15.926 A:middle
which lets you really easily go

00:08:15.926 --> 00:08:17.416 A:middle
and change an accessibility
setting

00:08:17.556 --> 00:08:19.876 A:middle
and immediately see
its effect on your app

00:08:20.176 --> 00:08:23.766 A:middle
without having to
leave your app.

00:08:24.026 --> 00:08:26.246 A:middle
And we're really
excited to announce

00:08:26.446 --> 00:08:30.166 A:middle
that this Accessibility
Inspector now supports all

00:08:30.166 --> 00:08:30.906 A:middle
of our platforms.

00:08:31.436 --> 00:08:35.416 A:middle
This means that with a single
Accessibility Inspector app

00:08:35.416 --> 00:08:39.506 A:middle
on your desktop you can audit
and inspect your apps running

00:08:39.506 --> 00:08:44.096 A:middle
on macOS and iOS,
watchOS and even tvOS.

00:08:44.476 --> 00:08:48.306 A:middle
And you can do this simply
by launching your app

00:08:48.306 --> 00:08:50.056 A:middle
on the simulator or on a device

00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:53.126 A:middle
and choosing the respective
target from the inspector.

00:08:53.626 --> 00:08:54.306 A:middle
It's that easy.

00:08:54.896 --> 00:09:01.246 A:middle
And we hope that with this
feature it'll make it easier

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:54.896 --> 00:09:01.246 A:middle
And we hope that with this
feature it'll make it easier

00:09:01.246 --> 00:09:03.826 A:middle
than ever for you to test
an audit for your accessibly

00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:05.126 A:middle
across all of our platforms.

00:09:05.656 --> 00:09:09.676 A:middle
So, to give you a demo of
all these exciting features

00:09:09.676 --> 00:09:11.076 A:middle
and the new accessibly
inspector,

00:09:11.646 --> 00:09:14.456 A:middle
I'd like to hand
it over to Patti.

00:09:15.516 --> 00:09:20.046 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:20.546 --> 00:09:22.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Patty Hoa.

00:09:22.276 --> 00:09:25.306 A:middle
And I'm super excited to
be the one to tell you all

00:09:25.306 --> 00:09:28.146 A:middle
about our new Accessibility
Inspector.

00:09:28.556 --> 00:09:30.666 A:middle
So, we've been working
really hard

00:09:30.666 --> 00:09:32.066 A:middle
to incorporate all
your feedback.

00:09:32.656 --> 00:09:37.856 A:middle
And so I can't wait to
show you what we have.

00:09:38.476 --> 00:09:42.516 A:middle
So, to note, Accessibility
Inspector is now part

00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:43.906 A:middle
of the developer package.

00:09:44.256 --> 00:09:46.686 A:middle
That means you can
simply go into Xcode

00:09:47.116 --> 00:09:50.306 A:middle
under the Open Developer
Tools section in the minibar

00:09:50.926 --> 00:09:53.076 A:middle
and launch the Accessibility
Inspector.

00:09:53.986 --> 00:09:57.726 A:middle
So here is a screenshot of
our new Accessibly Inspector.

00:09:57.726 --> 00:10:00.786 A:middle
I want to bring your attention
to the top section first.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:57.726 --> 00:10:00.786 A:middle
I want to bring your attention
to the top section first.

00:10:01.376 --> 00:10:05.386 A:middle
On the left we have what
we call the Target Chooser.

00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:10.356 A:middle
That allows you to inspect all
the different Apple devices

00:10:10.396 --> 00:10:12.946 A:middle
that we have, including
your iPhone, your iPad,

00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:15.356 A:middle
your desktop machine,
your watch,

00:10:15.396 --> 00:10:17.226 A:middle
your TV and the simulators.

00:10:17.786 --> 00:10:22.996 A:middle
In the middle we have what we
call the Inspection Pointer.

00:10:23.536 --> 00:10:25.276 A:middle
Now, when you have this enabled,

00:10:25.676 --> 00:10:29.676 A:middle
then the tool can
now inspect what is

00:10:29.676 --> 00:10:31.476 A:middle
under your finger
on your device.

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:35.906 A:middle
Or if you're in a simulator
or the desktop, it is what is

00:10:36.226 --> 00:10:37.396 A:middle
under your mouse cursor.

00:10:37.396 --> 00:10:41.966 A:middle
Then on the right we
have these three buttons.

00:10:43.546 --> 00:10:46.276 A:middle
These are three major
features of the tool.

00:10:46.936 --> 00:10:48.646 A:middle
And this is what I'll
be spending the rest

00:10:48.646 --> 00:10:51.406 A:middle
of the session telling you
more details and give you demos

00:10:51.406 --> 00:10:52.606 A:middle
of these three features.

00:10:53.256 --> 00:10:54.726 A:middle
So what are these
three features?

00:10:55.646 --> 00:10:57.266 A:middle
First, we have Inspection.

00:10:58.056 --> 00:11:01.056 A:middle
The Inspection feature
allows you to debug


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.056 --> 00:11:01.056 A:middle
The Inspection feature
allows you to debug

00:11:01.056 --> 00:11:04.816 A:middle
and analyze the accessibility
state of your app.

00:11:05.296 --> 00:11:07.866 A:middle
Then we have the Audit
feature to help you

00:11:07.866 --> 00:11:10.586 A:middle
to find accessibility
issues in your app.

00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:15.696 A:middle
And last we have the Settings
feature that helps you

00:11:15.696 --> 00:11:20.236 A:middle
to quickly test how accessibly
settings affect your app.

00:11:21.376 --> 00:11:25.046 A:middle
So the first one I want to talk
about is the Audit feature.

00:11:26.336 --> 00:11:29.456 A:middle
So, ultimately your goal is

00:11:29.516 --> 00:11:32.556 A:middle
to make sure your app is
accessible to everyone.

00:11:33.206 --> 00:11:36.396 A:middle
And to do that you need
to first audit your app.

00:11:36.736 --> 00:11:39.186 A:middle
Now, earlier Susumu
mentioned it would be awesome

00:11:39.186 --> 00:11:43.406 A:middle
if you could actually run with
VoiceOver or Switch control

00:11:43.586 --> 00:11:44.786 A:middle
and audit your app that way.

00:11:45.796 --> 00:11:48.466 A:middle
Or you could also hire an
accessibility consultant

00:11:48.466 --> 00:11:50.056 A:middle
to do the evaluation
on your behalf.

00:11:50.746 --> 00:11:54.196 A:middle
But today, I'm going to show
you a more cost effective way

00:11:54.406 --> 00:11:55.666 A:middle
to get that solution.

00:11:55.666 --> 00:12:03.406 A:middle
And that is simply use our
Audit feature of the tool.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:55.666 --> 00:12:03.406 A:middle
And that is simply use our
Audit feature of the tool.

00:12:04.416 --> 00:12:07.736 A:middle
And so, in our Audit tab we
have this Run Audit button.

00:12:08.176 --> 00:12:10.346 A:middle
And the best way to
show you and tell you

00:12:10.346 --> 00:12:12.266 A:middle
about this feature is
to give you a demo.

00:12:22.056 --> 00:12:25.076 A:middle
So I have here on the
screen a running version

00:12:25.076 --> 00:12:29.896 A:middle
of the iOS version of the
Math Learner app running

00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:30.696 A:middle
in the simulator.

00:12:30.696 --> 00:12:33.656 A:middle
And so you could play a game.

00:12:33.656 --> 00:12:34.486 A:middle
We have equation.

00:12:34.756 --> 00:12:36.626 A:middle
We could pick one
of these choices.

00:12:37.266 --> 00:12:38.026 A:middle
Not that one.

00:12:38.026 --> 00:12:38.836 A:middle
This one. There.

00:12:38.836 --> 00:12:43.106 A:middle
So that's how you play the game.

00:12:44.006 --> 00:12:47.026 A:middle
Okay. So now I want to launch
the Accessibility Inspector.

00:12:48.606 --> 00:12:51.446 A:middle
So, I simply go to Xcode.

00:12:51.796 --> 00:12:59.256 A:middle
And on the top, under
Open Developer Tool,

00:12:59.256 --> 00:13:02.356 A:middle
we're going to launch the
Accessibility Inspector.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.256 --> 00:13:02.356 A:middle
we're going to launch the
Accessibility Inspector.

00:13:02.966 --> 00:13:08.316 A:middle
So the first thing you
want to tell the tool is

00:13:08.426 --> 00:13:10.126 A:middle
which device you
want to inspect.

00:13:11.486 --> 00:13:15.166 A:middle
So in our Target Chooser, I'm
going to pick the Simulator.

00:13:18.816 --> 00:13:21.616 A:middle
And then we'll click
on this Audit tab here.

00:13:21.616 --> 00:13:24.826 A:middle
And here's that Run Audit
button I told you about.

00:13:25.486 --> 00:13:29.106 A:middle
So I'm going to go
ahead and click that.

00:13:29.326 --> 00:13:32.566 A:middle
In a split second we've
just audited this app.

00:13:33.066 --> 00:13:35.556 A:middle
And here are the
issues it found.

00:13:36.206 --> 00:13:38.976 A:middle
You can now select that.

00:13:39.326 --> 00:13:40.926 A:middle
As you cycle through
these issues,

00:13:41.206 --> 00:13:44.396 A:middle
you'll note that there's a
corresponding red highlight

00:13:44.466 --> 00:13:46.476 A:middle
over the area where
the problem resides.

00:13:47.066 --> 00:13:52.116 A:middle
And of course, if you're
inspecting an actual device

00:13:52.116 --> 00:13:56.916 A:middle
like iPhone or iPad, this is
probably the view you have.

00:13:57.396 --> 00:14:00.706 A:middle
So, now if you want to
know where the issue is,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:57.396 --> 00:14:00.706 A:middle
So, now if you want to
know where the issue is,

00:14:00.926 --> 00:14:03.466 A:middle
you will have to take your
eye focus away from the tool

00:14:03.836 --> 00:14:06.186 A:middle
and look on your iPad or iPhone.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:10.966 A:middle
So what we have here is
a little nice features,

00:14:11.086 --> 00:14:13.816 A:middle
just give you a little
preview, a screenshot,

00:14:14.176 --> 00:14:16.946 A:middle
of that same element that
has the issue right here

00:14:16.946 --> 00:14:17.326 A:middle
in the tools.

00:14:17.326 --> 00:14:20.346 A:middle
So you could keep your eye
focused on the tool itself.

00:14:22.136 --> 00:14:22.716 A:middle
All right.

00:14:22.806 --> 00:14:24.006 A:middle
So we have these issues.

00:14:24.976 --> 00:14:27.466 A:middle
So what's the next thing
you'd probably want to do?

00:14:27.466 --> 00:14:29.096 A:middle
Go fix it.

00:14:29.546 --> 00:14:30.876 A:middle
So let's pick one of
these issues here.

00:14:31.986 --> 00:14:33.166 A:middle
Element has no description.

00:14:33.166 --> 00:14:38.056 A:middle
And click on the disclosure
triangle here to expand

00:14:38.166 --> 00:14:39.116 A:middle
to get more information.

00:14:41.666 --> 00:14:42.086 A:middle
All right.

00:14:42.246 --> 00:14:44.586 A:middle
So element has no description.

00:14:45.056 --> 00:14:46.836 A:middle
What does that correspond
to the code?

00:14:46.836 --> 00:14:49.366 A:middle
Do you know which
piece of code to write?

00:14:50.576 --> 00:14:53.356 A:middle
Well, if you went online,
read all documentation

00:14:53.356 --> 00:14:56.456 A:middle
about the accessibility API
that might give you some hint

00:14:56.496 --> 00:14:57.816 A:middle
on how to fix this issue.

00:14:58.486 --> 00:15:00.906 A:middle
But today I'm going to show you
a faster way to get that answer.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.486 --> 00:15:00.906 A:middle
But today I'm going to show you
a faster way to get that answer.

00:15:01.896 --> 00:15:03.506 A:middle
Simply click on this
question mark here.

00:15:04.836 --> 00:15:07.546 A:middle
And the tool will tell
you which API to fix up.

00:15:08.356 --> 00:15:11.456 A:middle
It says: Consider setting
the accessibility label.

00:15:12.616 --> 00:15:15.556 A:middle
So, at this point, if you
know how the API works,

00:15:15.756 --> 00:15:18.596 A:middle
you would just go right into
your code and change it.

00:15:19.276 --> 00:15:22.596 A:middle
But if you want more information
about how this API operates,

00:15:23.296 --> 00:15:24.886 A:middle
you could click on
this hyperlink,

00:15:25.846 --> 00:15:27.626 A:middle
which then will take you to --

00:15:27.936 --> 00:15:30.476 A:middle
eventually take you to
documentation like this

00:15:30.476 --> 00:15:34.836 A:middle
where you could find more
information about the API.

00:15:37.256 --> 00:15:38.296 A:middle
All right?

00:15:38.296 --> 00:15:41.546 A:middle
Since now I know which API
to override, let's go right

00:15:41.546 --> 00:15:43.366 A:middle
into the code and fix it up.

00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:53.056 A:middle
So, what I'm fixing
is those button views

00:15:53.386 --> 00:15:54.216 A:middle
with the dots in there.

00:15:54.876 --> 00:15:58.986 A:middle
And the way it's implemented,
it's simply a custom UI view.

00:15:59.866 --> 00:16:03.546 A:middle
So now I'm simply going


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.866 --> 00:16:03.546 A:middle
So now I'm simply going

00:16:03.666 --> 00:16:07.536 A:middle
to override the accessibility
label here.

00:16:08.226 --> 00:16:16.346 A:middle
And I'm going to return a string
that describes those dots.

00:16:16.346 --> 00:16:20.796 A:middle
And of course, you should
always return localized string.

00:16:22.336 --> 00:16:24.616 A:middle
Okay? So now I have my
method written here.

00:16:25.936 --> 00:16:29.246 A:middle
I'm going to save it,
run and rerun that.

00:16:41.286 --> 00:16:43.076 A:middle
Okay, let's go back to Addition.

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:47.906 A:middle
And let's clear out
the old issues we have.

00:16:49.416 --> 00:16:52.966 A:middle
And rerun the Audit.

00:16:53.516 --> 00:16:55.486 A:middle
With that simple
change in the code,

00:16:56.066 --> 00:16:58.096 A:middle
we've just fixed up
a bunch of issues.

00:16:58.396 --> 00:16:58.946 A:middle
Isn't that great?

[ Applause ]

00:17:07.046 --> 00:17:07.316 A:middle
All right.

00:17:07.756 --> 00:17:12.286 A:middle
So, note that this same powerful
audit feature can be utilized

00:17:12.286 --> 00:17:15.146 A:middle
by other teams of your
member, like QAs who may want

00:17:15.146 --> 00:17:17.026 A:middle
to do an assessment
on your behalf.

00:17:17.705 --> 00:17:22.356 A:middle
And of course, then they will
want to report those bugs.

00:17:23.986 --> 00:17:27.185 A:middle
So, to speed up the process
in reporting those bugs,

00:17:27.796 --> 00:17:30.066 A:middle
they can now just,
after they run Audit,

00:17:30.236 --> 00:17:33.506 A:middle
they could simply copy and
paste it into the bug report.

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:38.366 A:middle
And of course, every good bug
report should have a screenshot.

00:17:39.716 --> 00:17:42.736 A:middle
So we have here this
Quick Look button here.

00:17:44.006 --> 00:17:48.046 A:middle
If I click on that, you should
get a nice big screenshot

00:17:48.496 --> 00:17:49.766 A:middle
of your entire screen,

00:17:50.336 --> 00:17:53.426 A:middle
plus where the problem
resides in this blue outline.

00:17:54.016 --> 00:17:55.666 A:middle
So again, you could
just copy that

00:17:57.386 --> 00:17:58.976 A:middle
and paste it into
your bug report.

00:17:59.186 --> 00:18:00.746 A:middle
And now you're ready
to send off that bug.

00:18:17.436 --> 00:18:17.726 A:middle
All right.

00:18:17.846 --> 00:18:22.696 A:middle
So what you've just seen is how
the Audit feature can help you

00:18:22.736 --> 00:18:25.936 A:middle
auto-detect problems
in your app.

00:18:25.936 --> 00:18:27.646 A:middle
It could give you
suggested solution.

00:18:27.986 --> 00:18:30.526 A:middle
And even speed up the process
of reporting those bugs.

00:18:32.906 --> 00:18:36.006 A:middle
As powerful and as
great as this feature is

00:18:36.046 --> 00:18:39.676 A:middle
in helping you detect
issues in your app,

00:18:39.676 --> 00:18:44.436 A:middle
similar to the compile
warnings in Xcode,

00:18:45.776 --> 00:18:49.906 A:middle
having no warning does not
mean your app doesn't have

00:18:50.116 --> 00:18:50.706 A:middle
any problem.

00:18:51.586 --> 00:18:53.306 A:middle
So that's why it's
important for you to do some

00:18:53.306 --> 00:18:55.366 A:middle
of that manual auditing
yourself.

00:18:55.886 --> 00:19:00.826 A:middle
And to show you why
this is important,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:55.886 --> 00:19:00.826 A:middle
And to show you why
this is important,

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:03.046 A:middle
let me give you an example.

00:19:03.686 --> 00:19:07.136 A:middle
So, suppose you have a button

00:19:07.786 --> 00:19:09.566 A:middle
and its function
is to send a mail.

00:19:10.446 --> 00:19:13.046 A:middle
Of course, the button comes
with a bunch of properties.

00:19:14.676 --> 00:19:16.956 A:middle
One thing we tend to
like to do when we want

00:19:16.956 --> 00:19:19.966 A:middle
to create a new button
is we simply take one

00:19:19.966 --> 00:19:22.596 A:middle
of these existing button
and we duplicate it.

00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:25.836 A:middle
And of course, that
means all the properties

00:19:26.156 --> 00:19:27.566 A:middle
of that button gets transferred.

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:31.016 A:middle
And we go and tweak
some of the properties

00:19:31.016 --> 00:19:35.296 A:middle
like the actions and the icons.

00:19:36.026 --> 00:19:37.136 A:middle
That's fine.

00:19:37.956 --> 00:19:38.896 A:middle
That's all good.

00:19:39.006 --> 00:19:44.176 A:middle
Except if you forget to
update some of the property,

00:19:44.176 --> 00:19:45.056 A:middle
that could be a problem.

00:19:45.356 --> 00:19:46.486 A:middle
Especially in this case,

00:19:46.536 --> 00:19:48.656 A:middle
it's the accessibility
label property.

00:19:50.566 --> 00:19:52.816 A:middle
For assistive clients
like VoiceOver,

00:19:53.486 --> 00:19:56.476 A:middle
the accessibility label
property is super important.

00:19:56.476 --> 00:19:59.226 A:middle
Because that's the only
piece of information it has

00:19:59.226 --> 00:20:01.386 A:middle
about how this button functions.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.226 --> 00:20:01.386 A:middle
about how this button functions.

00:20:02.946 --> 00:20:06.926 A:middle
So, if an assistive client
like VoiceOver were to land

00:20:06.926 --> 00:20:10.366 A:middle
on this button, and you haven't
updated the accessibility label,

00:20:10.366 --> 00:20:11.926 A:middle
it still says Send Mail.

00:20:11.926 --> 00:20:14.866 A:middle
But they're going to
press a button thinking

00:20:14.866 --> 00:20:15.806 A:middle
that they're sending a mail.

00:20:15.916 --> 00:20:18.466 A:middle
In fact, they've just
deleted that mail.

00:20:18.466 --> 00:20:20.596 A:middle
So that's not a great outcome.

00:20:21.226 --> 00:20:27.636 A:middle
And so for that, we're
here to help you go

00:20:27.636 --> 00:20:30.086 A:middle
through that manual
auditing using the tool.

00:20:30.466 --> 00:20:32.466 A:middle
And that's why I want to
talk about Inspection.

00:20:36.316 --> 00:20:38.916 A:middle
So let me give you some
highlights of Inspection

00:20:38.916 --> 00:20:40.266 A:middle
and show you how that helps you

00:20:40.346 --> 00:20:42.186 A:middle
through the manual
auditing process.

00:20:42.646 --> 00:20:44.836 A:middle
So, suppose we have
a button here

00:20:44.876 --> 00:20:45.916 A:middle
that has eight dots in there.

00:20:46.776 --> 00:20:52.866 A:middle
In the Inspection tab on the top
section there's the Quick Look.

00:20:52.866 --> 00:20:58.846 A:middle
And on the left side we have
the place where we describe,

00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:02.186 A:middle
or give you a summary of how
this element's being described.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:02.186 A:middle
or give you a summary of how
this element's being described.

00:21:02.546 --> 00:21:06.606 A:middle
So in this case the eight-dot
button, we'll just say 8.

00:21:07.196 --> 00:21:09.646 A:middle
And to the right there's
the Navigation button

00:21:09.646 --> 00:21:11.846 A:middle
that allows you to
easily navigate

00:21:11.846 --> 00:21:16.346 A:middle
to the neighboring UI
elements from this element,

00:21:16.536 --> 00:21:18.056 A:middle
from this button here.

00:21:19.076 --> 00:21:22.026 A:middle
Then below we have
the basic section

00:21:22.876 --> 00:21:26.966 A:middle
that contains properties that's
used to describe this element.

00:21:27.676 --> 00:21:30.436 A:middle
So for example, we have
Label, which corresponds

00:21:30.436 --> 00:21:31.796 A:middle
to Accessibility Label.

00:21:32.066 --> 00:21:33.486 A:middle
And returns the value 8.

00:21:33.596 --> 00:21:34.856 A:middle
And we have Trait.

00:21:35.016 --> 00:21:37.096 A:middle
In this case, it's a
button, so it returns Button.

00:21:38.776 --> 00:21:41.076 A:middle
And as this button
is interactable,

00:21:42.156 --> 00:21:45.286 A:middle
you'll look into the
Action section and see

00:21:45.286 --> 00:21:48.216 A:middle
that there's Activate
Action for this.

00:21:48.656 --> 00:21:52.006 A:middle
And so you could simply click
on the Perform button to verify

00:21:52.346 --> 00:21:53.316 A:middle
that this action works.

00:21:56.256 --> 00:21:58.146 A:middle
So that's a highlight
of Inspection.

00:21:58.256 --> 00:22:03.346 A:middle
Let me go ahead and
give you a demo of that.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.256 --> 00:22:03.346 A:middle
Let me go ahead and
give you a demo of that.

00:22:12.096 --> 00:22:12.866 A:middle
All right.

00:22:12.866 --> 00:22:15.846 A:middle
So we're back here on our app.

00:22:15.846 --> 00:22:18.226 A:middle
And now we're going to go
into the Inspection tab.

00:22:19.486 --> 00:22:23.116 A:middle
So remember earlier I mentioned
there's this Inspection Pointer.

00:22:23.786 --> 00:22:26.366 A:middle
Right now it's enabled, which
means when I take my mouse

00:22:26.456 --> 00:22:32.316 A:middle
over the items in the simulator,
the tool will start inspecting

00:22:32.316 --> 00:22:33.626 A:middle
that element under the cursor.

00:22:34.156 --> 00:22:35.976 A:middle
And you can see that
green highlight.

00:22:36.976 --> 00:22:41.726 A:middle
So on the simulator in desktop,
if you simply do a single click

00:22:42.256 --> 00:22:46.576 A:middle
on that item, it will turn
off the Inspection Pointer,

00:22:47.016 --> 00:22:49.466 A:middle
which then allows you
to now move your mouse

00:22:49.466 --> 00:22:51.946 A:middle
around without affecting
what is being inspected.

00:22:52.966 --> 00:22:55.296 A:middle
So right now we're
inspecting the addition.

00:22:55.296 --> 00:22:56.866 A:middle
And you see a description
for that.

00:22:57.676 --> 00:23:01.106 A:middle
Now, I could click on the
Go To Next Element button.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:57.676 --> 00:23:01.106 A:middle
Now, I could click on the
Go To Next Element button.

00:23:01.706 --> 00:23:04.466 A:middle
And you'll see the highlight
goes down to these buttons here.

00:23:04.976 --> 00:23:08.166 A:middle
Click again and we
go to the next one.

00:23:08.166 --> 00:23:09.466 A:middle
And also you get a description.

00:23:09.466 --> 00:23:10.326 A:middle
This is the four-dot.

00:23:11.726 --> 00:23:16.846 A:middle
Note that we completely
bypass something important:

00:23:17.096 --> 00:23:17.816 A:middle
The equation.

00:23:19.016 --> 00:23:21.686 A:middle
So simply doing this
navigation you could kind

00:23:21.686 --> 00:23:24.206 A:middle
of find issues along the way.

00:23:24.206 --> 00:23:26.896 A:middle
In this case we might have a
problem with this equation.

00:23:27.896 --> 00:23:29.136 A:middle
Let's keep going.

00:23:30.506 --> 00:23:32.886 A:middle
So, we're on the
eight dots, nine dots.

00:23:34.116 --> 00:23:36.046 A:middle
And down to this
Help button here.

00:23:36.376 --> 00:23:39.376 A:middle
Except the description
doesn't look so great, does it?

00:23:39.466 --> 00:23:41.536 A:middle
IMG 0151. Hmm.

00:23:41.966 --> 00:23:42.686 A:middle
Doesn't sound right.

00:23:42.686 --> 00:23:45.556 A:middle
So, again, that may be
another potential area

00:23:46.226 --> 00:23:48.156 A:middle
where you need to fix it up.

00:23:48.616 --> 00:23:52.206 A:middle
So, if you could simply use
this Quick Look section,

00:23:52.626 --> 00:23:57.586 A:middle
navigate through all the
UIs in your app and verify

00:23:57.586 --> 00:23:59.586 A:middle
that all the description
sounds good,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:00.256 --> 00:24:01.226 A:middle
then you're on the right track.

00:24:02.186 --> 00:24:06.266 A:middle
And of course, if you have
any UI that is interactable,

00:24:06.326 --> 00:24:08.946 A:middle
like these buttons,
you will simply go

00:24:08.946 --> 00:24:14.186 A:middle
to the Action Section and, in
this case I'm going to click

00:24:14.186 --> 00:24:16.566 A:middle
on the Perform button
to activate that button

00:24:16.926 --> 00:24:19.176 A:middle
to verify the action works.

00:24:19.716 --> 00:24:21.376 A:middle
All right.

00:24:21.766 --> 00:24:25.376 A:middle
So what I've just shown you is
how you could use the Inspection

00:24:25.896 --> 00:24:30.776 A:middle
to help you along with your
manual auditing of your app.

00:24:30.906 --> 00:24:36.706 A:middle
Now the Inspection is also great
to help you do some debugging

00:24:36.746 --> 00:24:39.726 A:middle
and analysis of the
accessibility state of your app.

00:24:40.956 --> 00:24:43.806 A:middle
An example of that is
understanding how the

00:24:43.806 --> 00:24:47.556 A:middle
accessibility hierarchy works,
which becomes quite important,

00:24:47.556 --> 00:24:49.926 A:middle
especially on an OS X app

00:24:49.926 --> 00:24:52.626 A:middle
where the corresponding
view hierarchy tend

00:24:52.846 --> 00:24:53.886 A:middle
to be more complex.

00:24:54.806 --> 00:24:57.186 A:middle
So to show you how this
feature works, let me go ahead

00:24:57.186 --> 00:25:00.326 A:middle
and launch the OS X
version of the same app.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:57.186 --> 00:25:00.326 A:middle
and launch the OS X
version of the same app.

00:25:07.426 --> 00:25:07.736 A:middle
All right?

00:25:07.916 --> 00:25:11.626 A:middle
So I have here the OS X
version of the same app.

00:25:11.916 --> 00:25:13.506 A:middle
And let's do something a
little bit more complex,

00:25:13.736 --> 00:25:14.856 A:middle
multiplication.

00:25:16.046 --> 00:25:17.926 A:middle
And so then when you
play, 3 times 6 --

00:25:17.926 --> 00:25:19.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Sorry, try again.

00:25:19.856 --> 00:25:20.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; -- that, how about this?

00:25:20.766 --> 00:25:22.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Incorrect.

00:25:22.176 --> 00:25:22.876 A:middle
Try again.

00:25:22.876 --> 00:25:24.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; -- 6. 18.

00:25:24.026 --> 00:25:24.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:25:25.546 --> 00:25:27.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay, so you play
the same game.

00:25:27.076 --> 00:25:28.646 A:middle
And you know, this app works.

00:25:29.116 --> 00:25:32.446 A:middle
We have the same version
app running on iOS and OS X.

00:25:32.446 --> 00:25:32.616 A:middle
All right.

00:25:33.436 --> 00:25:38.156 A:middle
So the first thing you
want to do is tell the tool

00:25:38.156 --> 00:25:41.046 A:middle
that you're inspecting
this new app.

00:25:42.006 --> 00:25:45.136 A:middle
So, we're going to go
and select my MacBook Pro

00:25:45.136 --> 00:25:48.056 A:middle
because we're inspecting the
desktop itself right now.

00:25:48.266 --> 00:25:50.096 A:middle
And in this case we
could also select

00:25:50.156 --> 00:25:51.516 A:middle
which app we want to inspect.

00:25:51.896 --> 00:25:53.216 A:middle
So I'm going to pick
the Math Learner.

00:25:53.776 --> 00:25:59.076 A:middle
And again, we could run Audit
and see what issues we find.

00:25:59.466 --> 00:26:00.726 A:middle
And it found a bunch of issues.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.466 --> 00:26:00.726 A:middle
And it found a bunch of issues.

00:26:01.806 --> 00:26:05.616 A:middle
I want to bring your attention
to these four issues here.

00:26:06.366 --> 00:26:08.276 A:middle
It says: "Potentially
inaccessible element."

00:26:08.756 --> 00:26:11.286 A:middle
So the way these answer
choices were implemented,

00:26:11.286 --> 00:26:14.136 A:middle
they were simply custom NSview.

00:26:14.666 --> 00:26:17.206 A:middle
That's drawing those
text via CA text layers.

00:26:18.106 --> 00:26:21.246 A:middle
Now, by default, CA layers
have no accessibility support.

00:26:21.876 --> 00:26:23.206 A:middle
Which means if you create them,

00:26:24.086 --> 00:26:27.266 A:middle
clients like VoiceOver is not
going to be able to see them.

00:26:27.266 --> 00:26:29.066 A:middle
And so the tool is
telling you that right now,

00:26:29.376 --> 00:26:30.596 A:middle
that these are not accessible.

00:26:30.596 --> 00:26:33.336 A:middle
So to understand
how to fix this up,

00:26:33.336 --> 00:26:36.626 A:middle
it helps to know how the
accessibility hierarchy works.

00:26:38.196 --> 00:26:39.626 A:middle
So let's go to the Inspection.

00:26:40.166 --> 00:26:43.916 A:middle
And again, I'm going to
turn on Inspection Pointer.

00:26:44.976 --> 00:26:47.866 A:middle
And so if I bring my
mouse over and, again,

00:26:47.866 --> 00:26:49.646 A:middle
it's going to inspect
whatever's under my mouse.

00:26:50.156 --> 00:26:50.966 A:middle
What I'm interested

00:26:50.966 --> 00:26:53.566 A:middle
in to inspect right now
is the entire window.

00:26:54.496 --> 00:26:56.656 A:middle
And the reason is
because I want to know

00:26:56.916 --> 00:26:59.936 A:middle
who are the children
of this window.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:00.566 --> 00:27:04.686 A:middle
So, the way I could I look
at that is I could look

00:27:05.266 --> 00:27:07.066 A:middle
under the hierarchy
section here.

00:27:07.646 --> 00:27:12.756 A:middle
And then here are all the
children of this window.

00:27:13.346 --> 00:27:16.366 A:middle
So, I'm on the equation.

00:27:16.366 --> 00:27:17.656 A:middle
You can see that red highlight.

00:27:18.426 --> 00:27:19.746 A:middle
On the image.

00:27:20.726 --> 00:27:21.966 A:middle
Some status text.

00:27:21.966 --> 00:27:25.136 A:middle
And a bunch of stuff in
the Tool Bar section.

00:27:25.906 --> 00:27:30.516 A:middle
So right now, those four crucial
answer choice buttons do not

00:27:30.516 --> 00:27:32.446 A:middle
exist as children of the window.

00:27:33.816 --> 00:27:35.496 A:middle
And so we know we need
to go and fix it up.

00:27:35.956 --> 00:27:38.106 A:middle
But today I'm not going to
show you how to fix it up.

00:27:39.076 --> 00:27:41.256 A:middle
Instead, I'm going to refer you

00:27:41.256 --> 00:27:44.926 A:middle
to our sample code
accessibility UI example.

00:27:45.506 --> 00:27:47.916 A:middle
It's something to download
from developer.apple.com.

00:27:48.696 --> 00:27:51.006 A:middle
This sample app contains
a whole library

00:27:51.006 --> 00:27:52.696 A:middle
with different UI scenarios

00:27:53.086 --> 00:27:56.116 A:middle
and how you could add
accessibly support for those.

00:27:56.906 --> 00:27:58.166 A:middle
So I encourage you to do that.

00:27:58.986 --> 00:28:01.676 A:middle
And once you fix it up, I expect


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:58.986 --> 00:28:01.676 A:middle
And once you fix it up, I expect

00:28:01.786 --> 00:28:05.986 A:middle
that those four answer choice
buttons should then appear

00:28:05.986 --> 00:28:08.136 A:middle
as children of this window.

00:28:08.356 --> 00:28:11.516 A:middle
So you could verify
it in this hierarchy.

00:28:17.156 --> 00:28:18.866 A:middle
So, what I've shown you

00:28:18.866 --> 00:28:21.816 A:middle
so far is how you can use
the Inspection feature

00:28:21.816 --> 00:28:24.296 A:middle
to help you do some of
that manual auditing.

00:28:25.106 --> 00:28:27.416 A:middle
And also how you could
use Inspection feature

00:28:27.716 --> 00:28:30.136 A:middle
to do some more debugging
and analysis

00:28:30.136 --> 00:28:31.966 A:middle
of the accessibility
state of your app.

00:28:33.136 --> 00:28:39.246 A:middle
The next thing I want to
talk about is Settings.

00:28:39.726 --> 00:28:43.336 A:middle
So, on every OS platform
we have many,

00:28:43.336 --> 00:28:45.106 A:middle
many accessibility settings.

00:28:45.536 --> 00:28:47.126 A:middle
That comes built right in.

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:54.486 A:middle
So for example, on the
iPhone, in the Settings app

00:28:54.756 --> 00:28:58.786 A:middle
under General Accessibility
you're going to find many,

00:28:58.786 --> 00:29:01.546 A:middle
many wonderful accessibility
features built right in.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.786 --> 00:29:01.546 A:middle
many wonderful accessibility
features built right in.

00:29:02.106 --> 00:29:04.146 A:middle
And settings like Toggle.

00:29:04.786 --> 00:29:09.006 A:middle
So let's say if you want to
know how Dynamic Font affects

00:29:09.006 --> 00:29:09.926 A:middle
your app.

00:29:09.926 --> 00:29:15.206 A:middle
You could go in, adjust the font
size to something really large.

00:29:16.086 --> 00:29:16.806 A:middle
Then go back to your app.

00:29:18.066 --> 00:29:21.526 A:middle
And then visually verify how a
large font looks in your app.

00:29:22.256 --> 00:29:24.016 A:middle
Then you could go back
to the Settings app.

00:29:25.856 --> 00:29:27.926 A:middle
Readjust to something
really small.

00:29:28.456 --> 00:29:35.406 A:middle
Then see how a small
font appears in your app.

00:29:35.686 --> 00:29:38.936 A:middle
Now, you could see that this
could become quite tedious

00:29:38.936 --> 00:29:41.936 A:middle
if you have to constantly
switch back and forth

00:29:42.306 --> 00:29:45.746 A:middle
between the Settings
app and your app.

00:29:45.746 --> 00:29:47.906 A:middle
And how do you know

00:29:47.906 --> 00:29:51.526 A:middle
which accessibility settings
are important to test?

00:29:53.096 --> 00:29:58.376 A:middle
Well, our tool will
answer that for you.

00:29:59.036 --> 00:30:02.096 A:middle
So, here's our Settings tab.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.036 --> 00:30:02.096 A:middle
So, here's our Settings tab.

00:30:02.446 --> 00:30:06.686 A:middle
Our Settings tab
now present you some

00:30:06.686 --> 00:30:09.716 A:middle
of the most common
accessibility settings

00:30:09.776 --> 00:30:10.876 A:middle
that we want you to test.

00:30:12.586 --> 00:30:14.546 A:middle
In addition, since it's
built right into the tool,

00:30:15.226 --> 00:30:16.576 A:middle
you no longer have to
switch back and forth

00:30:16.576 --> 00:30:19.176 A:middle
between the Settings
app and your app.

00:30:20.516 --> 00:30:25.016 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:25.516 --> 00:30:28.266 A:middle
And here's a demo to
show you that can work.

00:30:29.316 --> 00:30:31.896 A:middle
So in the Settings tab, now
you can invert the colors.

00:30:32.406 --> 00:30:36.416 A:middle
And immediately see the
effect it has on your app.

00:30:37.356 --> 00:30:39.526 A:middle
And we could do the same
thing with the font size.

00:30:40.076 --> 00:30:40.706 A:middle
Adjust it.

00:30:41.886 --> 00:30:43.486 A:middle
And see it directly.

00:30:54.716 --> 00:30:59.836 A:middle
So, what you've just seen is
how cool the Settings feature is


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:00.336 --> 00:31:01.556 A:middle
to make it easier for you.

00:31:02.226 --> 00:31:04.646 A:middle
So, today I've shown you
our three major features.

00:31:05.966 --> 00:31:09.096 A:middle
The first is the Audit
feature, that help you

00:31:09.096 --> 00:31:11.866 A:middle
to autodetect accessibility
issues in your app,

00:31:13.226 --> 00:31:14.866 A:middle
give you suggestions
on how to fix it.

00:31:15.526 --> 00:31:17.746 A:middle
And make it faster for you
to report those issues.

00:31:20.576 --> 00:31:23.616 A:middle
Then we saw how great
the Inspection feature is

00:31:23.976 --> 00:31:26.356 A:middle
to guide you through that
process of manual auditing

00:31:27.166 --> 00:31:29.406 A:middle
and allow you to do
debugging analysis

00:31:29.456 --> 00:31:32.296 A:middle
of the accessibility
state of your app.

00:31:32.606 --> 00:31:35.076 A:middle
And last, you just saw
the Settings feature

00:31:35.076 --> 00:31:37.006 A:middle
that will make it
much easier for you

00:31:37.006 --> 00:31:41.346 A:middle
to test how accessibility
settings changes affect

00:31:41.536 --> 00:31:41.816 A:middle
your app.

00:31:43.406 --> 00:31:49.476 A:middle
And that is the quick look
of Accessibility Inspector.

00:31:50.516 --> 00:31:55.736 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:56.236 --> 00:31:58.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you Patti.

00:31:58.966 --> 00:32:01.076 A:middle
So we really look
forward to having all

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.966 --> 00:32:01.076 A:middle
So we really look
forward to having all

00:32:01.076 --> 00:32:02.976 A:middle
of you try the new
Accessibility Inspector.

00:32:04.356 --> 00:32:08.836 A:middle
And we hope that you now
feel motivated to keep users

00:32:08.836 --> 00:32:12.416 A:middle
of all abilities in mind when
designing your next great app.

00:32:13.296 --> 00:32:15.026 A:middle
And to help you do that,

00:32:15.026 --> 00:32:17.936 A:middle
we introduced you today the
new Accessibility Inspector

00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:21.496 A:middle
that we hope will make it easier
than ever for you to find,

00:32:21.626 --> 00:32:24.446 A:middle
diagnose and fix accessibility
issues in your app.

00:32:24.956 --> 00:32:30.046 A:middle
And it integrates seamlessly
with your development workflow

00:32:30.746 --> 00:32:34.156 A:middle
so that you can easily
inspect and audit your apps,

00:32:34.336 --> 00:32:36.716 A:middle
whether it's running on a
simulator or on a device.

00:32:38.026 --> 00:32:41.606 A:middle
And we're really excited
to support all platforms

00:32:41.806 --> 00:32:45.126 A:middle
from macOS, iOS, to
watchOS and tvOS.

00:32:46.506 --> 00:32:49.706 A:middle
So we hope that with this
great new tool you will go out

00:32:49.706 --> 00:32:51.976 A:middle
and create wonderful
apps that can be enjoyed

00:32:51.976 --> 00:32:53.776 A:middle
by all users of all abilities.

00:32:55.716 --> 00:32:58.286 A:middle
