00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:40.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:40.786 --> 00:00:43.236 A:middle
Welcome to "iMessage Apps
and Stickers, Part 2".

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:46.776 A:middle
My name's Alex and with me today
helping present is Stephen.

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:47.796 A:middle
He's going to do the demos.

00:00:49.226 --> 00:00:51.526 A:middle
So, in the first part
of this talk, Bhaskar

00:00:51.526 --> 00:00:54.876 A:middle
and Lily introduced
stickers, sticker packs,

00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.876 A:middle
and simple iMessage apps focused

00:00:56.946 --> 00:00:59.386 A:middle
on providing sticker
data to messages.

00:01:01.976 --> 00:01:05.105 A:middle
Today we're going to talk
about interactive messages

00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:07.376 A:middle
and we're going to dive
deeper into the iMessage apps

00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:08.356 A:middle
and the Messages framework.

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:12.526 A:middle
So, what are interactive
messages?

00:01:13.776 --> 00:01:15.966 A:middle
Well, you can see one
here behind me highlighted

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.146 A:middle
in the Messages transcript.

00:01:18.926 --> 00:01:21.826 A:middle
This is a special type of
message bubble provided

00:01:21.826 --> 00:01:25.926 A:middle
by a Messages extension and
you can see that's shown here

00:01:25.926 --> 00:01:27.226 A:middle
in the screenshot highlighted.

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:34.836 A:middle
Messages extensions
allow your users

00:01:34.836 --> 00:01:38.776 A:middle
to compose interactive messages
and then they allow them

00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:41.766 A:middle
to insert them on the
input field, as shown here.

00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:48.186 A:middle
They also allow a user to
reply to an interactive message

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:50.976 A:middle
by tapping one in the transcript

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:54.046 A:middle
and in this point an extension
will be launched full screen,

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:54.816 A:middle
as shown here.

00:01:54.816 --> 00:02:00.866 A:middle
The user can interact with this
extension to compose a reply.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:54.816 --> 00:02:00.866 A:middle
The user can interact with this
extension to compose a reply.

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:05.866 A:middle
Your extension can then
insert this new content

00:02:06.806 --> 00:02:08.895 A:middle
into the messages and it will
show here on the input field

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:11.656 A:middle
and the user can send it.

00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:14.316 A:middle
So, now we're going to
welcome Stephen to the stage

00:02:14.316 --> 00:02:16.196 A:middle
and he's going to show
you our sample app running

00:02:16.196 --> 00:02:16.956 A:middle
in the simulator.

00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:23.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:28.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm going to show you a
completed iMessage application

00:02:29.306 --> 00:02:31.916 A:middle
that I've written to demo all
of the APIs that we're going

00:02:31.916 --> 00:02:32.906 A:middle
to learn in today's session.

00:02:33.626 --> 00:02:35.776 A:middle
If you look here in the
simulator, you'll see the icon

00:02:35.976 --> 00:02:37.506 A:middle
from my iMessage app
called Ice Cream.

00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:42.086 A:middle
When I tap this, my iMessage
app is revealed here running

00:02:42.136 --> 00:02:43.576 A:middle
within the context of Messages.

00:02:44.486 --> 00:02:47.506 A:middle
All of the UI with this
pink background is code--

00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:49.336 A:middle
is UI provided by my extension.

00:02:50.696 --> 00:02:53.266 A:middle
Now, my iMessage app is
a collaborative ice cream

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:56.486 A:middle
sticker-building application
and here you see a history

00:02:56.486 --> 00:02:58.136 A:middle
of ice cream stickers
that I've already built.

00:02:59.296 --> 00:03:03.946 A:middle
When I tap this Add button here,
my iMessage app will expand


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.296 --> 00:03:03.946 A:middle
When I tap this Add button here,
my iMessage app will expand

00:03:03.946 --> 00:03:07.236 A:middle
to take the full screen and I'll
have this nice sticker-building

00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:08.546 A:middle
experience here.

00:03:09.946 --> 00:03:13.236 A:middle
If I choose an ice cream cone,
my iMessage app dismisses

00:03:13.606 --> 00:03:15.296 A:middle
and stages an interactive
message

00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:16.676 A:middle
in the input field
for the user to send.

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:23.126 A:middle
Now, on iOS 10, we've
added support for you to--

00:03:23.466 --> 00:03:26.206 A:middle
for you to develop and test
your iMessage apps right

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:26.966 A:middle
within the simulator.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.936 A:middle
If you go back to the
conversation list here,

00:03:30.596 --> 00:03:33.516 A:middle
you'll see two ends of a
simulated conversation.

00:03:35.186 --> 00:03:38.506 A:middle
Tapping the second one shows
the simulated received message.

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:44.086 A:middle
When I tap this, my iMessage app
is launched with the next step

00:03:44.086 --> 00:03:45.346 A:middle
in the ice cream
building process.

00:03:46.146 --> 00:03:47.966 A:middle
I can select my favorite
ice cream, mint chip,

00:03:49.606 --> 00:03:52.076 A:middle
stage that message, and send it.

00:03:54.016 --> 00:03:57.086 A:middle
Now, if I go back to that first
conversation or the first end

00:03:57.086 --> 00:03:59.826 A:middle
of the conversation
and tap this message


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:03.276 A:middle
and select the final part of
the ice cream, my topping,

00:04:05.486 --> 00:04:08.766 A:middle
and send it, I now have
a completed ice cream

00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:09.906 A:middle
that I've built.

00:04:10.536 --> 00:04:13.526 A:middle
In fact, now when I go
back into my iMessage app,

00:04:14.686 --> 00:04:17.536 A:middle
you'll see that it appears
here in my ice cream history

00:04:17.805 --> 00:04:20.935 A:middle
as a sticker that I can then
apply anywhere I want to.

00:04:22.236 --> 00:04:23.756 A:middle
And that's a quick
sample of what you can do

00:04:23.756 --> 00:04:24.756 A:middle
with interactive messages.

00:04:25.186 --> 00:04:26.026 A:middle
And now back to Alex.

00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:29.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:30.046 --> 00:04:30.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Stephen.

00:04:31.906 --> 00:04:34.736 A:middle
That was just a great
quick demo of some

00:04:34.736 --> 00:04:35.956 A:middle
of the features of
iMessage apps.

00:04:36.986 --> 00:04:41.426 A:middle
So, let's talk about how we can
accomplish this with our APIs.

00:04:41.976 --> 00:04:43.326 A:middle
I'm going to go through
four things.

00:04:44.466 --> 00:04:47.266 A:middle
One of them-- so I'm going
to give you an overview

00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:50.246 A:middle
of the API followed by
number two, a little look

00:04:50.246 --> 00:04:51.706 A:middle
into the extension lifecycle.

00:04:52.696 --> 00:04:56.546 A:middle
Number three, we're
going to talk about how

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.686 A:middle
to compose a message
using our APIs.

00:04:59.156 --> 00:05:01.476 A:middle
Number four, we're going
to talk a little bit


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.156 --> 00:05:01.476 A:middle
Number four, we're going
to talk a little bit

00:05:01.476 --> 00:05:02.816 A:middle
about how the message is sent.

00:05:04.206 --> 00:05:06.736 A:middle
So, starting with
the API overview.

00:05:08.796 --> 00:05:10.806 A:middle
We have our iMessage
app running here,

00:05:10.806 --> 00:05:15.126 A:middle
shown in compact presentation
mode and this is an extension.

00:05:15.696 --> 00:05:17.436 A:middle
Extensions have a
principal class

00:05:17.476 --> 00:05:19.946 A:middle
and for iMessage apps
this will be a subclass

00:05:19.946 --> 00:05:22.236 A:middle
of the
MSMessagesAppViewController.

00:05:22.236 --> 00:05:23.836 A:middle
Now, ultimately,

00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:26.516 A:middle
the MSMessagesAppViewController
is a subclass

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:29.436 A:middle
of UIViewController, so it's
providing your extension's UI.

00:05:29.436 --> 00:05:34.436 A:middle
Above the extension, we
have the conversation

00:05:35.026 --> 00:05:37.376 A:middle
and specifically the
conversation transcript.

00:05:38.456 --> 00:05:42.136 A:middle
This is represented in our API
by the MSConversation object.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.916 A:middle
And finally we have
a message itself.

00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:47.696 A:middle
We have this bubble
here in the transcript

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:51.196 A:middle
and this is represented
by the MSMessage class.

00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:55.096 A:middle
Also, you'll note in this slide
we have another two classes

00:05:55.096 --> 00:05:58.536 A:middle
shown, the MSSession and
MSMessageTemplateLayout.

00:05:58.836 --> 00:06:01.426 A:middle
These provide some control
over how the message is sent


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.836 --> 00:06:01.426 A:middle
These provide some control
over how the message is sent

00:06:01.726 --> 00:06:03.736 A:middle
and how the message
appears in the transcript.

00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:10.406 A:middle
So, let's move on and talk about
iMessage extension lifecycle.

00:06:10.406 --> 00:06:17.086 A:middle
Here we have a timeline and
when an extension is launched,

00:06:18.126 --> 00:06:22.466 A:middle
perhaps from the app drawer,
we're going to launch a process.

00:06:25.346 --> 00:06:28.246 A:middle
Shortly afterwards, we'll
call didBecomeActive

00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:30.176 A:middle
with conversation and
we're going to pass

00:06:30.176 --> 00:06:31.316 A:middle
in a conversation object

00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:33.896 A:middle
that represents the conversation
your app is running within.

00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:37.476 A:middle
And since this is a
UIViewController subclass,

00:06:37.476 --> 00:06:40.816 A:middle
we'll also call will--
viewWillAppear and viewDidAppear

00:06:41.906 --> 00:06:43.756 A:middle
as your extension
appears onscreen.

00:06:45.756 --> 00:06:47.666 A:middle
Now, what happens
when your app remove--

00:06:47.666 --> 00:06:48.696 A:middle
is removed from the screen?

00:06:48.696 --> 00:06:51.096 A:middle
We're going to call
this resigning active

00:06:51.096 --> 00:06:54.646 A:middle
and what happens is first you
will receive viewWillDisappear,

00:06:55.286 --> 00:06:57.666 A:middle
viewDidDisappear calls
on your principal class.

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:01.086 A:middle
This is followed by
a viewWill-- sorry--


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:01.086 A:middle
This is followed by
a viewWill-- sorry--

00:07:01.326 --> 00:07:01.926 A:middle
this is followed

00:07:01.926 --> 00:07:04.716 A:middle
by a willResignActive
call with conversation.

00:07:05.116 --> 00:07:08.016 A:middle
At this point, we're about
to teardown the connection

00:07:08.016 --> 00:07:10.206 A:middle
between Messages
and your extension.

00:07:10.976 --> 00:07:13.076 A:middle
So, this is the last time
you get to do anything

00:07:13.076 --> 00:07:14.016 A:middle
with the conversation.

00:07:14.216 --> 00:07:17.466 A:middle
And then at some point later
your process will be terminated

00:07:17.796 --> 00:07:20.786 A:middle
and this-- just to stress-- is
because your process is built

00:07:20.786 --> 00:07:23.606 A:middle
on extensions and extensions
are short-lived processes

00:07:23.606 --> 00:07:25.236 A:middle
and they're terminated
aggressively.

00:07:26.396 --> 00:07:32.516 A:middle
So, let's see now that we have
a process running and showing UI

00:07:32.516 --> 00:07:36.656 A:middle
within Messages, your user is
going to interact with this UI

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:38.556 A:middle
and build a message and
let's see how we're going

00:07:38.556 --> 00:07:40.166 A:middle
to deal with that in our API.

00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:41.856 A:middle
Well, the first thing
you're going

00:07:41.856 --> 00:07:44.986 A:middle
to do is create an MSMessage
object and we're going

00:07:44.986 --> 00:07:46.576 A:middle
to set some properties
on that object.

00:07:47.096 --> 00:07:50.816 A:middle
In this case, I'm
setting an https URL

00:07:50.816 --> 00:07:54.486 A:middle
so the message is URL property
and I'm encoding some detail

00:07:54.486 --> 00:07:55.966 A:middle
about the ice cream
that we're building

00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:57.796 A:middle
in the query string of that URL.

00:07:57.796 --> 00:08:00.676 A:middle
The only platform that is
able to generate iMessage--


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:57.796 --> 00:08:00.676 A:middle
The only platform that is
able to generate iMessage--

00:08:00.936 --> 00:08:04.386 A:middle
these messages is iOS, but
these messages will be sent

00:08:04.676 --> 00:08:06.386 A:middle
to macOS and to watchOS.

00:08:08.106 --> 00:08:09.806 A:middle
When they're delivered on
macOS, they'll be shown

00:08:09.806 --> 00:08:12.336 A:middle
in full fidelity in the
conversation transcript

00:08:12.336 --> 00:08:15.986 A:middle
and clicking on a message
in the transcript will try

00:08:15.986 --> 00:08:18.276 A:middle
and get this URL and open
it in your web browser.

00:08:18.746 --> 00:08:23.586 A:middle
So, if you provide an https URL
here, then your website is able

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:27.286 A:middle
to show-- should be able
to show some representation

00:08:27.286 --> 00:08:30.136 A:middle
of the message for
users on macOS.

00:08:30.696 --> 00:08:32.846 A:middle
Moving on, we have an
accessibility label

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:33.466 A:middle
property here.

00:08:33.966 --> 00:08:36.616 A:middle
This is used by screen readers
when reading the transcript.

00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:39.126 A:middle
So, I'm setting this
to a description

00:08:39.126 --> 00:08:41.176 A:middle
of the message bubble
so that our users

00:08:41.176 --> 00:08:43.566 A:middle
who use screen readers get
a great rich description

00:08:43.616 --> 00:08:46.766 A:middle
of the bubble as it is
displayed in the transcript.

00:08:47.566 --> 00:08:50.836 A:middle
And finally I'm going to talk
about-- we've got layout.

00:08:50.836 --> 00:08:54.576 A:middle
And I'm going to talk about this
in a little bit more detail now.

00:08:55.156 --> 00:08:59.596 A:middle
The layout object is how
we specify the appearance

00:09:00.116 --> 00:09:01.436 A:middle
of a message in the transcript.

00:09:01.956 --> 00:09:03.426 A:middle
Right now we only
have one layout

00:09:03.426 --> 00:09:05.766 A:middle
and that's the
MSMessageTemplateLayout.

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:08.246 A:middle
We can set some properties
on this

00:09:08.246 --> 00:09:10.236 A:middle
and this affects how
the bubble is built.

00:09:11.456 --> 00:09:13.596 A:middle
So, right here we
have an image property

00:09:13.596 --> 00:09:16.626 A:middle
and this takes a UI image
and it provides content

00:09:16.626 --> 00:09:18.036 A:middle
for the area highlighted
onscreen.

00:09:19.626 --> 00:09:21.726 A:middle
We also have a mediaFileURL
property.

00:09:22.376 --> 00:09:26.456 A:middle
The mediaFileURL also provides
content for the same area

00:09:26.456 --> 00:09:29.566 A:middle
as the image, but here you
can provide content that's not

00:09:29.566 --> 00:09:30.796 A:middle
supported by UI image.

00:09:31.056 --> 00:09:33.806 A:middle
For instance, you could provide
a URL to a local video file.

00:09:34.176 --> 00:09:36.386 A:middle
A short video would be then
looped in the background

00:09:36.386 --> 00:09:38.056 A:middle
of the message bubble
in the transcript.

00:09:38.656 --> 00:09:41.046 A:middle
Let's take a second to
focus a little bit more

00:09:41.046 --> 00:09:42.026 A:middle
on these two properties.

00:09:42.866 --> 00:09:46.176 A:middle
We should note first
that if the image

00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:49.276 A:middle
and the URL are both provided,
then the image is going

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:51.266 A:middle
to take precedence over the URL.

00:09:51.266 --> 00:09:56.256 A:middle
We had some recommended--
recommendations for the size

00:09:56.256 --> 00:09:58.446 A:middle
of the assets provided
in these properties.

00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:01.156 A:middle
We're recommending that
you provide your assets


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:01.156 A:middle
We're recommending that
you provide your assets

00:10:01.156 --> 00:10:03.646 A:middle
at roughly 300 point
by 300 point.

00:10:04.116 --> 00:10:06.396 A:middle
You can provide slightly
larger assets

00:10:06.396 --> 00:10:08.516 A:middle
and slightly smaller assets
and I really encourage you

00:10:08.516 --> 00:10:11.956 A:middle
to experiment with asset
sizes here in order

00:10:11.956 --> 00:10:14.946 A:middle
to find what best suits
your app and your needs.

00:10:16.046 --> 00:10:19.616 A:middle
All of these assets, as with
stickers, are provided at 3x

00:10:19.856 --> 00:10:23.376 A:middle
and Messages will downsample
and downscale these images

00:10:23.376 --> 00:10:25.626 A:middle
when they arrive on other
devices as appropriate

00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:28.416 A:middle
for the screen resolution on
that-- on the receiving device.

00:10:28.996 --> 00:10:35.446 A:middle
In the mediaFileURL, we support
PNG, JPEG, GIF, and video.

00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:37.736 A:middle
When I say video,
what I mean here is

00:10:37.736 --> 00:10:39.976 A:middle
that we support any
videos that can be played

00:10:39.976 --> 00:10:42.506 A:middle
with our media player frameworks
and I'd like to refer you

00:10:42.506 --> 00:10:44.346 A:middle
to the media player
framework documentation

00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:47.066 A:middle
to find out more about this.

00:10:48.236 --> 00:10:49.496 A:middle
The other thing that
we're going to do

00:10:49.496 --> 00:10:50.906 A:middle
with this media is we're going

00:10:50.906 --> 00:10:52.646 A:middle
to transcode the assets
when they're sent.

00:10:52.946 --> 00:10:54.336 A:middle
This is in order
to optimize them

00:10:54.336 --> 00:10:55.826 A:middle
for transfer over our networks.

00:10:56.386 --> 00:11:00.436 A:middle
And finally I'd like
to encourage you


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:56.386 --> 00:11:00.436 A:middle
And finally I'd like
to encourage you

00:11:00.436 --> 00:11:02.986 A:middle
to avoid rendering
text into this image.

00:11:04.376 --> 00:11:07.186 A:middle
As I said, these images
are scaled down for display

00:11:07.186 --> 00:11:10.496 A:middle
on devices with 1x and 2x
screens, yet we're asking you

00:11:10.496 --> 00:11:12.136 A:middle
to provide them at 3x.

00:11:12.556 --> 00:11:14.286 A:middle
If you were to render
text into this image,

00:11:14.286 --> 00:11:17.666 A:middle
particularly small text, when
these images are scaled down,

00:11:17.666 --> 00:11:21.686 A:middle
the text could be rendered
illegible, but you'll notice

00:11:21.686 --> 00:11:24.796 A:middle
that we actually do show in this
example some text drawn on top

00:11:24.796 --> 00:11:27.946 A:middle
of the image, so let's
talk about how this is done

00:11:28.126 --> 00:11:29.426 A:middle
without degrading quality.

00:11:30.676 --> 00:11:34.586 A:middle
The layout has some additional
properties over image--

00:11:34.586 --> 00:11:37.566 A:middle
the two that provide images--
and these are text properties.

00:11:38.746 --> 00:11:42.906 A:middle
They're transformatted with
the message and drawn natively

00:11:42.906 --> 00:11:45.656 A:middle
on the receiving devices
so we can draw the text

00:11:46.146 --> 00:11:49.866 A:middle
on the receiving devices as
crisply and cleanly as possible.

00:11:50.546 --> 00:11:52.976 A:middle
We have here shown
the image title

00:11:52.976 --> 00:11:55.756 A:middle
and this is text that's
drawn on top of the image

00:11:56.386 --> 00:11:57.586 A:middle
in the lower left hand corner.

00:11:59.016 --> 00:12:02.476 A:middle
We have an image subtitle that's
drawn again on top of the image,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:59.016 --> 00:12:02.476 A:middle
We have an image subtitle that's
drawn again on top of the image,

00:12:02.596 --> 00:12:04.566 A:middle
right below the image
title as shown.

00:12:04.566 --> 00:12:06.566 A:middle
And we have these
caption properties

00:12:06.566 --> 00:12:09.406 A:middle
and these are drawn below
the image in the caption bar.

00:12:09.476 --> 00:12:10.876 A:middle
That's this gray area onscreen.

00:12:11.296 --> 00:12:16.996 A:middle
So, we have caption,
trailing caption, subcaption,

00:12:17.046 --> 00:12:20.206 A:middle
and trailing subcaption.

00:12:20.766 --> 00:12:29.786 A:middle
Now, if you look at the caption
properties, it's also possible

00:12:29.786 --> 00:12:33.596 A:middle
to omit these altogether
or set them all to nil.

00:12:34.466 --> 00:12:36.986 A:middle
If you do that, then
you'll get a bubble

00:12:36.986 --> 00:12:38.926 A:middle
that doesn't have the
caption bar at the bottom

00:12:38.996 --> 00:12:40.546 A:middle
and it'll look something
more like this.

00:12:41.686 --> 00:12:43.896 A:middle
And one last thing to
note on this slide.

00:12:44.746 --> 00:12:47.536 A:middle
We have an icon in the top
left-hand corner of a bubble.

00:12:48.026 --> 00:12:50.786 A:middle
This icon is provided and
drawn by Messages on top

00:12:50.786 --> 00:12:53.116 A:middle
of your content and
this is always going

00:12:53.116 --> 00:12:57.886 A:middle
to be the iMessage app icon of
the app that sent the message.

00:12:59.836 --> 00:13:03.116 A:middle
So, let's move on now and talk
about how we send this message


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.836 --> 00:13:03.116 A:middle
So, let's move on now and talk
about how we send this message

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:03.996 A:middle
that we've constructed.

00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:08.426 A:middle
To do that, we're going to need

00:13:08.426 --> 00:13:10.356 A:middle
to get an MSConversation
instance.

00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:12.866 A:middle
You can get this from
your principal class's

00:13:12.866 --> 00:13:14.066 A:middle
active conversation.

00:13:15.316 --> 00:13:16.746 A:middle
Once you have a conversation,

00:13:17.206 --> 00:13:18.716 A:middle
you can call the
insert(message),

00:13:19.066 --> 00:13:21.916 A:middle
pass the message you
constructed, and make sure

00:13:21.916 --> 00:13:23.526 A:middle
that you handle any
errors that are returned.

00:13:24.756 --> 00:13:26.156 A:middle
Doing this will cause
the message

00:13:26.156 --> 00:13:27.496 A:middle
to appear in the input field.

00:13:28.166 --> 00:13:33.026 A:middle
Of course, as mentioned
in the first talk,

00:13:33.026 --> 00:13:34.796 A:middle
you can also send some
other types of data.

00:13:34.996 --> 00:13:39.056 A:middle
We support sending
text, attachments,

00:13:39.626 --> 00:13:45.226 A:middle
and of course stickers.

00:13:46.066 --> 00:13:48.876 A:middle
Once you've got your
content on the input field,

00:13:48.876 --> 00:13:50.706 A:middle
the user is able
to send the message

00:13:50.736 --> 00:13:53.176 A:middle
by tapping the blue Send
button and I should note here

00:13:53.176 --> 00:13:54.656 A:middle
that there's no way
for your extension

00:13:54.656 --> 00:13:56.756 A:middle
to actually automatically
send a message

00:13:56.756 --> 00:13:59.186 A:middle
and we always want the
user to have the final say

00:13:59.716 --> 00:14:01.516 A:middle
as to what gets sent
to their friends.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:59.716 --> 00:14:01.516 A:middle
as to what gets sent
to their friends.

00:14:02.126 --> 00:14:05.926 A:middle
So, now I'd like to hand
you back over to Stephen

00:14:05.926 --> 00:14:07.996 A:middle
who is going to show you
how we implement this

00:14:08.156 --> 00:14:09.396 A:middle
in our sample project.

00:14:12.516 --> 00:14:17.056 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:18.446 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks again, Alex.

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:21.846 A:middle
OK. I've taken the
sample iMessage app

00:14:21.896 --> 00:14:24.046 A:middle
that I showed earlier in
the session and stripped it

00:14:24.046 --> 00:14:26.616 A:middle
down to a very basic minimum
for our starting point.

00:14:27.416 --> 00:14:29.146 A:middle
Here we still have our
history of ice cream stickers

00:14:29.146 --> 00:14:31.026 A:middle
that have already been
built, but you'll notice

00:14:31.026 --> 00:14:33.426 A:middle
that if I tap the Add
button, nothing happens.

00:14:34.156 --> 00:14:38.796 A:middle
Here in Xcode, I have my
MSMessagesAppViewController

00:14:38.796 --> 00:14:39.976 A:middle
subclass shown.

00:14:40.566 --> 00:14:42.806 A:middle
I override the lifecycle
method did become active

00:14:42.806 --> 00:14:44.656 A:middle
with conversation, call super,

00:14:45.086 --> 00:14:46.916 A:middle
and then call present
child view controller

00:14:46.916 --> 00:14:48.316 A:middle
which is a helper
method I've written

00:14:49.096 --> 00:14:51.856 A:middle
which will instantiate an
ice cream history controller

00:14:52.886 --> 00:14:54.286 A:middle
and add it as a child
view controller.

00:14:55.466 --> 00:14:56.536 A:middle
And that's all I have so far.

00:14:58.366 --> 00:14:59.846 A:middle
Now, what I'd like to do is

00:14:59.846 --> 00:15:02.656 A:middle
when I tap this Add
button is start the


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.846 --> 00:15:02.656 A:middle
when I tap this Add
button is start the

00:15:02.656 --> 00:15:03.856 A:middle
sticker-building process.

00:15:05.006 --> 00:15:07.706 A:middle
Now, this ice cream history
view controller has a delegate

00:15:07.706 --> 00:15:10.796 A:middle
protocol and I have an extension
on my messages view controller

00:15:11.226 --> 00:15:12.416 A:middle
which conforms to this delegate

00:15:12.416 --> 00:15:14.326 A:middle
by implementing the method
historyViewController

00:15:14.516 --> 00:15:15.376 A:middle
AddButtonTapped.

00:15:17.056 --> 00:15:19.976 A:middle
This is where I'm going to
trigger my functionality

00:15:19.976 --> 00:15:22.536 A:middle
and I'm going to also start

00:15:22.536 --> 00:15:26.796 A:middle
by adding a helper method called
composeMessage for iceCream,

00:15:27.246 --> 00:15:29.856 A:middle
which will take an ice cream
model object and will turn it

00:15:29.856 --> 00:15:32.696 A:middle
into an MSMessage for me to
stage in my conversation.

00:15:34.146 --> 00:15:37.746 A:middle
To do so, I'm going to create
an instance of URL components

00:15:38.176 --> 00:15:40.436 A:middle
and set the query items
property of that URL components

00:15:40.436 --> 00:15:42.826 A:middle
to be a query items
representation of my model.

00:15:44.236 --> 00:15:46.836 A:middle
Next thing I'm going to
do is create an instance

00:15:46.836 --> 00:15:50.176 A:middle
of MSMessageTemplateLayout and
set the image of that layout

00:15:50.426 --> 00:15:52.316 A:middle
to be a rendered
version of my model.

00:15:53.306 --> 00:15:55.316 A:middle
I also want to set a
caption for my message

00:15:56.056 --> 00:16:01.996 A:middle
and I'll declare
my caption up here.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:56.056 --> 00:16:01.996 A:middle
and I'll declare
my caption up here.

00:16:02.456 --> 00:16:04.606 A:middle
Now I'm ready to create
my MSMessage object.

00:16:05.646 --> 00:16:09.776 A:middle
I'll do so by declaring
an instance of MSMessage

00:16:10.206 --> 00:16:11.466 A:middle
and set the URL property

00:16:11.466 --> 00:16:13.696 A:middle
to be the URL representation
of my components.

00:16:14.556 --> 00:16:16.546 A:middle
Then I'll set the layout
and the accessibility label.

00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:18.546 A:middle
For brevity in the
demo, I'm just going

00:16:18.546 --> 00:16:21.816 A:middle
to reuse my message caption
as my accessibility label.

00:16:22.446 --> 00:16:24.806 A:middle
Now that I have my message,

00:16:24.806 --> 00:16:26.216 A:middle
I'm ready to stage it
in the conversation.

00:16:27.176 --> 00:16:29.086 A:middle
I'll get a reference to
my active conversation

00:16:30.576 --> 00:16:32.846 A:middle
and call conversation.insert

00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:36.796 A:middle
to insert the message
so it is staged.

00:16:38.296 --> 00:16:40.086 A:middle
Now that I've written my
composeMessage function,

00:16:41.056 --> 00:16:42.056 A:middle
here I'm ready to call it

00:16:42.056 --> 00:16:44.266 A:middle
from my historyViewController
AddButtonTapped method.

00:16:44.786 --> 00:16:49.496 A:middle
And I'll start off
by always adding

00:16:50.026 --> 00:16:52.296 A:middle
or passing a new ice
cream model instance.

00:16:52.906 --> 00:16:56.516 A:middle
Now when I run this
in the iOS simulator

00:16:57.896 --> 00:16:59.486 A:middle
and launch my iMessage
application,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:00.236 --> 00:17:05.415 A:middle
wait for that debugger to attach
and tap the Plus (+) button.

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:07.876 A:middle
My message is staged
for the user to send.

00:17:08.776 --> 00:17:10.886 A:middle
Now, because I haven't actually
selected any ice cream parts,

00:17:10.886 --> 00:17:13.516 A:middle
I just have a placeholder
image for the ice cream

00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:15.685 A:middle
and you see my caption
below the message.

00:17:17.096 --> 00:17:19.866 A:middle
Now, this is a great start,
but I'd like to get closer

00:17:19.866 --> 00:17:21.756 A:middle
to that final demo that
I showed you earlier.

00:17:22.866 --> 00:17:24.836 A:middle
When I tap that Plus
(+) button, I want to go

00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:26.766 A:middle
into my sticker-building
UI experience.

00:17:27.656 --> 00:17:30.546 A:middle
To do so, I need to introduce
a new concept to you.

00:17:31.766 --> 00:17:33.356 A:middle
Here my iMessage
app is presented

00:17:33.356 --> 00:17:35.006 A:middle
in a compact presentation style.

00:17:36.176 --> 00:17:38.186 A:middle
I can choose to have my
iMessage app presented

00:17:38.186 --> 00:17:40.716 A:middle
in an expanded presentation
style by requesting it.

00:17:42.746 --> 00:17:44.086 A:middle
Instead of calling
composeMessage

00:17:44.086 --> 00:17:47.386 A:middle
for iceCream here, I'll call
a method on my super class,

00:17:48.036 --> 00:17:51.006 A:middle
request presentation style
with the expanded enum case.

00:17:52.386 --> 00:17:55.686 A:middle
This will trigger a lifecycle
callback method called

00:17:55.686 --> 00:17:58.256 A:middle
willTransition to
presentationStyle.

00:17:59.816 --> 00:18:01.676 A:middle
I'll call the super
implementation


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.816 --> 00:18:01.676 A:middle
I'll call the super
implementation

00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:06.906 A:middle
and then I'll call
my helper method

00:18:07.196 --> 00:18:09.126 A:middle
to present the right
child view controller

00:18:09.186 --> 00:18:10.256 A:middle
for this presentation style.

00:18:12.456 --> 00:18:12.596 A:middle
Now,

00:18:12.596 --> 00:18:15.366 A:middle
my presentChildViewController
currently always presents my ice

00:18:15.366 --> 00:18:17.436 A:middle
cream history view
controller and so I need

00:18:17.436 --> 00:18:19.916 A:middle
to change the logic to take into
account the presentation style

00:18:20.306 --> 00:18:21.906 A:middle
so I present the
correct view controller.

00:18:23.116 --> 00:18:25.346 A:middle
First, I'm going to add a
parameter here so I know

00:18:25.346 --> 00:18:26.906 A:middle
which presentation
style I'm dealing with.

00:18:28.246 --> 00:18:30.086 A:middle
Then I'm going to change this

00:18:30.856 --> 00:18:33.626 A:middle
to only present my history
view controller when I'm

00:18:33.626 --> 00:18:35.046 A:middle
in the compact presentation
style.

00:18:36.566 --> 00:18:39.546 A:middle
If I'm in the expanded
case, I'm instead going

00:18:39.546 --> 00:18:41.926 A:middle
to declare a new instance
of my ice cream model

00:18:42.826 --> 00:18:45.416 A:middle
and let my controller
be an instance

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:48.456 A:middle
of an ice cream builder
view controller

00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:50.526 A:middle
to which I'll pass
that ice cream model.

00:18:52.406 --> 00:18:55.776 A:middle
Now, lastly, before I add this
as a child view controller,

00:18:56.236 --> 00:18:59.666 A:middle
I need to remove any previous
child view controllers


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:00.146 --> 00:19:01.156 A:middle
to clean up my view hierarchy.

00:19:01.156 --> 00:19:08.246 A:middle
Now I need to update the call
sites to my helper method.

00:19:08.766 --> 00:19:11.826 A:middle
Here I'm going to add that--

00:19:11.926 --> 00:19:16.316 A:middle
pass that pending presentation
style and in the didBecomeActive

00:19:16.316 --> 00:19:17.396 A:middle
with conversation method,

00:19:17.956 --> 00:19:20.396 A:middle
I'm going to pass the
current presentation style,

00:19:20.776 --> 00:19:24.026 A:middle
which I can get as a property
on my parent view controller.

00:19:28.676 --> 00:19:29.216 A:middle
Should be right.

00:19:31.096 --> 00:19:34.416 A:middle
Lastly-- actually, let's see--

00:19:34.416 --> 00:19:37.306 A:middle
let's see what this looks like
if I can get this to work.

00:19:46.646 --> 00:19:47.846 A:middle
And I tap that Plus (+) button.

00:19:48.826 --> 00:19:51.136 A:middle
My iMessage application
goes to that expanded state

00:19:51.446 --> 00:19:54.106 A:middle
and I'm presenting that ice
cream builder view-- experience.

00:19:55.216 --> 00:19:57.126 A:middle
However, you'll notice that
when I tap Select nothing

00:19:57.126 --> 00:19:57.606 A:middle
happens yet.

00:19:58.286 --> 00:20:00.586 A:middle
Now, this is because my ice
cream builder view controller


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.286 --> 00:20:00.586 A:middle
Now, this is because my ice
cream builder view controller

00:20:00.706 --> 00:20:03.686 A:middle
also has a delegate protocol
and I have an extension

00:20:04.306 --> 00:20:07.896 A:middle
on my view controller here--
sorry to take you through that

00:20:08.676 --> 00:20:12.146 A:middle
so fast-- that implements
this delegate protocol

00:20:12.436 --> 00:20:14.636 A:middle
by implementing the method
iceCreamBuilderView controller

00:20:14.716 --> 00:20:16.276 A:middle
didSelect iceCreamPart
for iceCream.

00:20:17.666 --> 00:20:20.016 A:middle
This is called whenever that
Select button is tapped.

00:20:21.476 --> 00:20:23.156 A:middle
So, this is the right
point for me to call

00:20:23.156 --> 00:20:26.406 A:middle
that helper method I wrote,
compose message, and I'll pass

00:20:26.406 --> 00:20:28.466 A:middle
in the updated ice cream
model from this method.

00:20:29.796 --> 00:20:32.226 A:middle
The other thing I'm going
to do is call dismiss here

00:20:32.986 --> 00:20:37.356 A:middle
because my iMessage app is done
preparing content and so I'd

00:20:37.356 --> 00:20:38.726 A:middle
like my iMessage app to dismiss

00:20:38.726 --> 00:20:40.546 A:middle
and display the staged
message for the user.

00:20:51.046 --> 00:20:54.466 A:middle
Now when we launch this,
tap the Plus (+) button

00:20:55.216 --> 00:20:56.476 A:middle
and select an ice cream cone.

00:20:57.666 --> 00:20:59.816 A:middle
I dismiss my iMessage app

00:20:59.816 --> 00:21:02.326 A:middle
and the correct interactive
message is stage ready


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.816 --> 00:21:02.326 A:middle
and the correct interactive
message is stage ready

00:21:02.326 --> 00:21:03.086 A:middle
for the user to send.

00:21:03.086 --> 00:21:05.106 A:middle
And that's a quick
demo of what it looks

00:21:05.106 --> 00:21:06.976 A:middle
like to send an interactive
message.

00:21:07.446 --> 00:21:07.976 A:middle
Now back to Alex.

00:21:08.516 --> 00:21:15.266 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:15.766 --> 00:21:16.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Stephen.

00:21:16.556 --> 00:21:17.026 A:middle
Great demo.

00:21:19.686 --> 00:21:25.056 A:middle
So, Stephen has introduced
to you and shown you how

00:21:25.056 --> 00:21:28.416 A:middle
to use our APIs to
insert content

00:21:28.416 --> 00:21:30.026 A:middle
into the conversation
and send it.

00:21:30.986 --> 00:21:33.286 A:middle
Stephen also introduced
presentation styles,

00:21:33.916 --> 00:21:35.036 A:middle
so we're going to
have a quick look

00:21:35.036 --> 00:21:36.296 A:middle
at that in some more detail.

00:21:37.656 --> 00:21:41.076 A:middle
We have two presentation
styles, compact and expanded.

00:21:42.376 --> 00:21:46.076 A:middle
Compact one is shown here
and here we have expanded.

00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:50.206 A:middle
So, there's a couple
of differences

00:21:50.206 --> 00:21:52.056 A:middle
between these two
presentation styles.

00:21:52.986 --> 00:21:55.386 A:middle
In compact mode, you don't
have access to the keyboard.

00:21:56.496 --> 00:22:00.296 A:middle
You also don't have access
to horizontal scrolling,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:56.496 --> 00:22:00.296 A:middle
You also don't have access
to horizontal scrolling,

00:22:00.426 --> 00:22:02.096 A:middle
swipe gesture recognizes.

00:22:02.726 --> 00:22:05.986 A:middle
This is because in the compact
mode the user can swipe left

00:22:05.986 --> 00:22:10.896 A:middle
and right to switch between
iMessage apps quickly.

00:22:11.566 --> 00:22:14.506 A:middle
However, you do have
access to the input field,

00:22:14.506 --> 00:22:16.316 A:middle
so whenever insert
message is called

00:22:16.366 --> 00:22:18.386 A:middle
in compact presentation style,

00:22:19.056 --> 00:22:20.466 A:middle
the message will
be inserted right

00:22:20.466 --> 00:22:21.816 A:middle
into the input fields right away

00:22:21.816 --> 00:22:24.046 A:middle
and the user can
see it immediately.

00:22:24.896 --> 00:22:28.356 A:middle
Subsequent calls to insert
message will cause the current

00:22:28.356 --> 00:22:30.096 A:middle
message to be replaced
with the new one,

00:22:30.246 --> 00:22:32.096 A:middle
so what you can do
here is allow your user

00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:36.106 A:middle
to iteratively build a
message, see it as it progresses

00:22:36.106 --> 00:22:37.746 A:middle
on the input field,
and when they're happy

00:22:37.746 --> 00:22:39.906 A:middle
with it they can send it.

00:22:41.616 --> 00:22:45.186 A:middle
To contrast, in expanded
presentation style we obviously

00:22:45.186 --> 00:22:46.836 A:middle
don't have access to
the input field here,

00:22:47.406 --> 00:22:49.056 A:middle
but we do have access

00:22:49.056 --> 00:22:51.556 A:middle
to horizontal swipe gesture
recognizes and scrolling

00:22:52.286 --> 00:22:53.696 A:middle
and you can use the keyboard.

00:22:56.796 --> 00:23:01.566 A:middle
The user can always
transition your extension


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:56.796 --> 00:23:01.566 A:middle
The user can always
transition your extension

00:23:01.686 --> 00:23:04.566 A:middle
between these two styles by
tapping on the top chevron

00:23:04.566 --> 00:23:08.336 A:middle
from expanded to collapse to
compact presentation style

00:23:08.766 --> 00:23:11.956 A:middle
and when in compact they can
tap on the chevron at the bottom

00:23:11.956 --> 00:23:13.576 A:middle
of the screen to expand your app

00:23:13.576 --> 00:23:15.256 A:middle
into expanded presentation
style.

00:23:15.856 --> 00:23:17.796 A:middle
So, when you're using
iMessage apps,

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:21.956 A:middle
you need to be very
responsive to the area

00:23:21.956 --> 00:23:23.586 A:middle
in which your app is displayed.

00:23:23.586 --> 00:23:28.916 A:middle
Whenever these transitions
happen, you're going

00:23:28.916 --> 00:23:31.226 A:middle
to get some callbacks
on your principal class.

00:23:31.936 --> 00:23:35.016 A:middle
The willTransition to
presentationStyle will be called

00:23:35.016 --> 00:23:38.456 A:middle
as the transition
starts and at the end

00:23:38.946 --> 00:23:42.076 A:middle
when the transition is complete
will call didTransition(to:

00:23:42.076 --> 00:23:43.056 A:middle
presentationStyle).

00:23:44.526 --> 00:23:47.936 A:middle
As Stephen showed, you can
request presentation style

00:23:47.936 --> 00:23:52.856 A:middle
expanded or compact by calling
the requestPresentationStyle

00:23:52.856 --> 00:23:54.606 A:middle
method on your principal class.

00:23:55.056 --> 00:23:57.886 A:middle
And again, as was shown in
the demo, you can call dismiss

00:23:57.886 --> 00:23:59.506 A:middle
and this will dismiss
your iMessage app

00:23:59.836 --> 00:24:00.766 A:middle
and show the keyboard.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.836 --> 00:24:00.766 A:middle
and show the keyboard.

00:24:02.796 --> 00:24:06.176 A:middle
So, let's move on and talk
about how we reply to a message.

00:24:06.846 --> 00:24:10.056 A:middle
We have two cases here to cover.

00:24:11.396 --> 00:24:13.996 A:middle
One case when your extension is
inactive and there's a bubble

00:24:13.996 --> 00:24:16.476 A:middle
in the transcript that the
user taps and we're going

00:24:16.476 --> 00:24:17.496 A:middle
to look at that first.

00:24:18.636 --> 00:24:19.986 A:middle
We'll come back to
the second case.

00:24:22.796 --> 00:24:24.246 A:middle
So, looking at our
timeline again,

00:24:24.806 --> 00:24:26.896 A:middle
this should be very familiar.

00:24:27.716 --> 00:24:29.526 A:middle
The bubble is tapped by the user

00:24:30.756 --> 00:24:32.106 A:middle
and your process
will be launched.

00:24:32.186 --> 00:24:36.676 A:middle
And now we go through exactly
the same set of steps that we do

00:24:36.676 --> 00:24:38.576 A:middle
when your app is launched
from the app drawer.

00:24:39.686 --> 00:24:42.786 A:middle
You'll get a didBecomeActive
with conversation followed

00:24:42.786 --> 00:24:45.186 A:middle
by the viewWillAppear
and viewDidAppear.

00:24:46.076 --> 00:24:47.726 A:middle
When this is done, you'll--

00:24:47.726 --> 00:24:50.666 A:middle
your app will be presented in
expanded presentation style.

00:24:51.936 --> 00:24:56.476 A:middle
We always present apps in
expanded presentation style

00:24:56.476 --> 00:24:58.846 A:middle
when the user taps a button
to launch it-- sorry--

00:24:58.846 --> 00:25:01.466 A:middle
taps a bubble in the
transcript to launch it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.846 --> 00:25:01.466 A:middle
taps a bubble in the
transcript to launch it.

00:25:02.106 --> 00:25:07.696 A:middle
Now, looking at our second case,
the extension is already active.

00:25:07.696 --> 00:25:11.456 A:middle
In this case it's showing UI in
the compact presentation style.

00:25:13.056 --> 00:25:16.286 A:middle
So, looking again at our
timeline, in this case,

00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:18.836 A:middle
the bubble is tapped
and the app is active.

00:25:19.496 --> 00:25:21.986 A:middle
So, we're not going to
call willBecomeActive

00:25:21.986 --> 00:25:22.866 A:middle
or didBecomeActive.

00:25:23.726 --> 00:25:26.326 A:middle
Instead, you'll receive
a call to willTransition

00:25:26.326 --> 00:25:28.236 A:middle
to presentationStyle expanded.

00:25:29.356 --> 00:25:32.596 A:middle
This is followed by a didSelect
message and conversation.

00:25:33.906 --> 00:25:36.286 A:middle
This is called on your principal
class and it lets you know

00:25:36.286 --> 00:25:38.346 A:middle
that the user tapped on a
bubble in the transcript

00:25:38.346 --> 00:25:39.876 A:middle
and selected a message.

00:25:41.106 --> 00:25:42.536 A:middle
Then finally as the transition

00:25:42.536 --> 00:25:45.186 A:middle
to expanded presentation
style completes you'll get the

00:25:45.186 --> 00:25:47.146 A:middle
didTransition to
presentationStyle.

00:25:47.146 --> 00:25:52.466 A:middle
So, now at the end of
both of these timelines,

00:25:53.096 --> 00:25:56.606 A:middle
your app is presenting the UI in
the expanded presentation style

00:25:56.856 --> 00:25:59.686 A:middle
and you'll want to get that
message that was tapped,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:00.196 --> 00:26:03.976 A:middle
so this is done using the
MSConversation's selectedMessage

00:26:03.976 --> 00:26:05.676 A:middle
property and you can get this

00:26:05.676 --> 00:26:07.306 A:middle
from the current
active conversation

00:26:07.306 --> 00:26:09.966 A:middle
on your principal class.

00:26:10.606 --> 00:26:13.706 A:middle
You're going to want to show
the selected message in your UI

00:26:13.736 --> 00:26:16.216 A:middle
and allow the user to
compose a response.

00:26:18.386 --> 00:26:20.126 A:middle
Now I'd like you to hand
you back over to Stephen

00:26:20.126 --> 00:26:21.486 A:middle
for one final demo
showing you how

00:26:21.486 --> 00:26:23.986 A:middle
to implement reply
in our sample app.

00:26:25.516 --> 00:26:30.696 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:31.196 --> 00:26:32.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; OK, so we left off

00:26:32.626 --> 00:26:34.336 A:middle
with a staged message
we're sending here,

00:26:34.756 --> 00:26:35.786 A:middle
which I'll go ahead and send.

00:26:36.126 --> 00:26:40.326 A:middle
And now if I go back to the
conversation list and go

00:26:40.326 --> 00:26:42.776 A:middle
to the other end of
that conversation I have

00:26:42.776 --> 00:26:43.676 A:middle
that received message.

00:26:44.916 --> 00:26:46.026 A:middle
When I tap that message,

00:26:46.376 --> 00:26:49.086 A:middle
my iMessage app is
correctly launched; however,

00:26:49.266 --> 00:26:51.916 A:middle
my ice cream building experience
doesn't show the next step

00:26:51.916 --> 00:26:52.956 A:middle
in the ice cream
building process.

00:26:52.956 --> 00:26:56.156 A:middle
I'm not ready to select ice
cream scoops yet and this is

00:26:56.156 --> 00:26:57.046 A:middle
because every time

00:26:57.046 --> 00:26:59.016 A:middle
that I currently present
this view controller,

00:26:59.276 --> 00:27:01.226 A:middle
I'm always passing in a
new ice cream model object.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.276 --> 00:27:01.226 A:middle
I'm always passing in a
new ice cream model object.

00:27:02.206 --> 00:27:04.216 A:middle
What I need to do is look
at the selected message

00:27:04.216 --> 00:27:06.766 A:middle
on the conversation and use
an ice cream model object

00:27:06.766 --> 00:27:08.466 A:middle
from that selected
message if it exists.

00:27:10.136 --> 00:27:14.476 A:middle
So, I'll go back up here
to where I'm instantiating

00:27:14.476 --> 00:27:18.306 A:middle
that ice cream builder
controller and get a reference

00:27:18.306 --> 00:27:24.196 A:middle
to my active conversation
.Then I will use a failable

00:27:24.196 --> 00:27:28.796 A:middle
initializer here that looks at
the message on the conversation

00:27:29.966 --> 00:27:31.856 A:middle
and if that initializer
fails then I know

00:27:31.856 --> 00:27:34.316 A:middle
that I don't have anything in
progress and I'll just create

00:27:34.316 --> 00:27:37.546 A:middle
that new ice cream model, but
if it does exist then I can pass

00:27:37.546 --> 00:27:38.726 A:middle
in the in progress ice cream.

00:27:40.406 --> 00:27:42.546 A:middle
The other thing I want
to do is make sure

00:27:42.546 --> 00:27:45.096 A:middle
that I am passing the
correct caption text depending

00:27:45.166 --> 00:27:47.886 A:middle
on the ice cream part
that has been selected.

00:27:50.026 --> 00:27:54.246 A:middle
To do so, I'm going to need
to pass a new parameter

00:27:54.246 --> 00:27:56.606 A:middle
into this method, which is
the selectedIceCreamPart.

00:27:57.726 --> 00:28:02.486 A:middle
Now, this message caption here
I'll change to a declaration


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.726 --> 00:28:02.486 A:middle
Now, this message caption here
I'll change to a declaration

00:28:03.266 --> 00:28:07.216 A:middle
of the string type and
then I'm going to switch

00:28:08.616 --> 00:28:09.896 A:middle
on the selectedIceCreamPart

00:28:10.196 --> 00:28:11.606 A:middle
to choose a correct
message caption.

00:28:11.606 --> 00:28:19.996 A:middle
Oh, and I also need to update
the call site to my method here

00:28:19.996 --> 00:28:21.546 A:middle
to pass in that new parameter.

00:28:22.586 --> 00:28:38.596 A:middle
Now when I launch my iMessage
app, tap the Plus (+) button,

00:28:39.306 --> 00:28:43.926 A:middle
send that first message and then
go back to the conversation list

00:28:44.286 --> 00:28:45.766 A:middle
and to the other end
of the conversation

00:28:47.346 --> 00:28:49.566 A:middle
and now I'll tap the received
message and you'll see

00:28:49.916 --> 00:28:52.376 A:middle
that my ice cream builder view
controller is correctly set

00:28:52.376 --> 00:28:53.626 A:middle
up to pick an ice cream scoop.

00:28:55.946 --> 00:29:00.006 A:middle
Now I can select some
mint chip, send it,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:55.946 --> 00:29:00.006 A:middle
Now I can select some
mint chip, send it,

00:29:01.746 --> 00:29:02.646 A:middle
go back to the other end

00:29:02.646 --> 00:29:06.056 A:middle
of the conversation once
more, and select a topping.

00:29:06.056 --> 00:29:11.056 A:middle
So, now you can see
what it looks

00:29:11.056 --> 00:29:13.016 A:middle
like to send interactive
messages back and forth

00:29:13.266 --> 00:29:14.956 A:middle
and accomplish a
task collaboratively.

00:29:16.786 --> 00:29:18.546 A:middle
However, you'll see that
in my conversation UI,

00:29:18.546 --> 00:29:20.516 A:middle
my partially built ice
creams are starting

00:29:20.516 --> 00:29:21.896 A:middle
to pollute my conversation
a little bit.

00:29:23.296 --> 00:29:25.306 A:middle
I don't really need to see the
partially built ice creams,

00:29:25.306 --> 00:29:27.056 A:middle
I only really care about
the completed ice cream.

00:29:28.876 --> 00:29:31.746 A:middle
What I'd like to do is
collapse those previous messages

00:29:32.006 --> 00:29:33.716 A:middle
and maybe leave behind
a succinct summary

00:29:34.226 --> 00:29:34.996 A:middle
of those messages.

00:29:35.996 --> 00:29:38.576 A:middle
To do so, I'm going to make use
of a new object called MSSession

00:29:39.046 --> 00:29:40.116 A:middle
to group messages together.

00:29:43.406 --> 00:29:44.986 A:middle
Here when I'm composing
my message,

00:29:46.016 --> 00:29:48.166 A:middle
I'm going to move my reference

00:29:48.166 --> 00:29:51.566 A:middle
to my active conversation
a little bit so that

00:29:52.256 --> 00:29:57.366 A:middle
when I declare my session
object I can look to see

00:29:57.366 --> 00:30:01.616 A:middle
if I have a session already on
the selected message and use


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:57.366 --> 00:30:01.616 A:middle
if I have a session already on
the selected message and use

00:30:01.616 --> 00:30:04.086 A:middle
that if it exists so that it
will continue the same grouping.

00:30:05.196 --> 00:30:07.046 A:middle
Otherwise, I'll create
a new MSSession object.

00:30:09.386 --> 00:30:10.736 A:middle
I'll then pass that session here

00:30:12.406 --> 00:30:14.456 A:middle
into my initializer
for MSMessage.

00:30:17.576 --> 00:30:19.806 A:middle
Now, the other thing I want to
do is provide a nice summary

00:30:19.806 --> 00:30:21.306 A:middle
of messages when
they're collapsed.

00:30:23.956 --> 00:30:25.136 A:middle
Here I'm going to
declare a method

00:30:25.366 --> 00:30:27.826 A:middle
or declare a variable
called summary Text

00:30:29.896 --> 00:30:35.126 A:middle
and here I'll choose the right
summaryText depending upon the

00:30:35.126 --> 00:30:36.176 A:middle
ice cream part that was chosen.

00:30:39.756 --> 00:30:42.746 A:middle
Now I could take that
summaryText variable and set it

00:30:42.746 --> 00:30:43.916 A:middle
on my MSMessage object.

00:30:45.856 --> 00:30:47.756 A:middle
And that's it.

00:30:50.256 --> 00:30:53.476 A:middle
Oh, maybe I should
actually assign it.

00:30:54.666 --> 00:31:01.096 A:middle
There we go.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:54.666 --> 00:31:01.096 A:middle
There we go.

00:31:01.736 --> 00:31:06.416 A:middle
Now when I launch my iMessage
app and go about the process

00:31:06.416 --> 00:31:10.756 A:middle
of building an ice cream--

00:31:12.356 --> 00:31:15.686 A:middle
doesn't ice cream
sound good right now?

00:31:16.586 --> 00:31:20.586 A:middle
I can pick my flavor of
ice cream and you'll see

00:31:20.586 --> 00:31:24.436 A:middle
that that summary text has
already been collapsed and shown

00:31:24.436 --> 00:31:26.536 A:middle
for me there when
I send my message.

00:31:28.966 --> 00:31:32.446 A:middle
Now if I go-- sorry-- I'm going
to go back to the first part

00:31:32.446 --> 00:31:35.856 A:middle
of the conversation, tap
this message once more.

00:31:35.926 --> 00:31:41.456 A:middle
I think chocolate sounds like
a good topping right now.

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:44.326 A:middle
Now when I send that I have a
completed ice cream message,

00:31:44.766 --> 00:31:47.626 A:middle
but I'm only showing the one--

00:31:47.626 --> 00:31:51.206 A:middle
the one image here and I have a
nice summary text throughout my

00:31:51.206 --> 00:31:53.556 A:middle
transcript there.

00:31:53.796 --> 00:31:56.906 A:middle
Also, when I go into
my Ice Cream app here,

00:31:57.836 --> 00:32:00.776 A:middle
you'll see my newly completed
ice cream sticker ready for me


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:57.836 --> 00:32:00.776 A:middle
you'll see my newly completed
ice cream sticker ready for me

00:32:00.776 --> 00:32:01.946 A:middle
to use however I'd like.

00:32:03.186 --> 00:32:03.716 A:middle
And that's it.

00:32:03.716 --> 00:32:05.146 A:middle
We have a completed
demo application.

00:32:05.756 --> 00:32:07.666 A:middle
Now, this was an example of how

00:32:07.666 --> 00:32:11.066 A:middle
to build an interactive
sticker-building application,

00:32:11.436 --> 00:32:13.266 A:middle
but you could take
this to do anything.

00:32:13.266 --> 00:32:14.676 A:middle
You can build-- you
can integrate

00:32:14.676 --> 00:32:15.786 A:middle
with wonderful services

00:32:16.146 --> 00:32:18.386 A:middle
and build nice awesome
collaborative games

00:32:18.386 --> 00:32:19.386 A:middle
and I can't wait to
see what you build.

00:32:20.036 --> 00:32:20.636 A:middle
Now, back to Alex.

00:32:21.516 --> 00:32:23.926 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:24.426 --> 00:32:24.886 A:middle
Thanks, Stephen.

00:32:24.886 --> 00:32:26.166 A:middle
That was another awesome demo

00:32:26.456 --> 00:32:28.716 A:middle
and Stephen implemented
the reply

00:32:28.806 --> 00:32:32.486 A:middle
and also introduced
something new, the MSSession.

00:32:33.066 --> 00:32:34.996 A:middle
So, let's dive into
the MSSession.

00:32:35.526 --> 00:32:42.146 A:middle
What we saw in the demo was a
messy transcript containing lots

00:32:42.146 --> 00:32:45.626 A:middle
of half-completed ice creams
and we saw how to use MSSession

00:32:46.026 --> 00:32:48.486 A:middle
to take that and turn it into
something that looks a bit more

00:32:48.486 --> 00:32:51.806 A:middle
like this, which is a lot
neater and less cluttered.

00:32:52.536 --> 00:32:52.916 A:middle
It's great.

00:32:53.666 --> 00:32:58.476 A:middle
So, to implement this, we
used an MSSession object.

00:32:58.676 --> 00:33:03.026 A:middle
We created an MSSession and
then for our first message


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:58.676 --> 00:33:03.026 A:middle
We created an MSSession and
then for our first message

00:33:03.026 --> 00:33:05.496 A:middle
that was part of the session,
we passed that session

00:33:05.836 --> 00:33:08.646 A:middle
into its initializer and we
have this session message.

00:33:09.556 --> 00:33:12.486 A:middle
We can set some summary text

00:33:13.016 --> 00:33:17.356 A:middle
and then we send it using the
conversation's insert message,

00:33:17.446 --> 00:33:18.406 A:middle
as we've seen before.

00:33:18.406 --> 00:33:24.626 A:middle
When we're replying to a
session message, we don't want

00:33:24.626 --> 00:33:27.406 A:middle
to create a new session; we
need to reuse an existing one

00:33:27.456 --> 00:33:29.726 A:middle
and we can get the
existing session

00:33:29.936 --> 00:33:31.786 A:middle
from the current conversation

00:33:31.786 --> 00:33:34.036 A:middle
so the activeConversation
selectedMessage.

00:33:34.276 --> 00:33:36.836 A:middle
The selected message will
have a second session property

00:33:37.096 --> 00:33:38.356 A:middle
if it's a session message.

00:33:40.016 --> 00:33:44.716 A:middle
Then we take that session, we
pass it into the sessions--

00:33:44.716 --> 00:33:47.186 A:middle
the messages initializer,
as we saw before.

00:33:49.316 --> 00:33:53.036 A:middle
We see here the summaryText
is providing text

00:33:53.096 --> 00:33:55.646 A:middle
for the message summary in
the conversation transcript.

00:33:56.816 --> 00:34:00.116 A:middle
You can now also omit this
property or set it to nil


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:56.816 --> 00:34:00.116 A:middle
You can now also omit this
property or set it to nil

00:34:00.116 --> 00:34:04.826 A:middle
and if you do that then there
will not be a summaryText entry

00:34:04.826 --> 00:34:07.656 A:middle
in the transcript, but your
message will still partake

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:09.275 A:middle
in the session behavior.

00:34:09.576 --> 00:34:12.116 A:middle
So, now we've covered the basics
of the API and we've seen how

00:34:12.116 --> 00:34:14.295 A:middle
to build a very simple
iMessage app

00:34:14.826 --> 00:34:18.545 A:middle
that sends interactive
messages between your friends.

00:34:19.045 --> 00:34:22.106 A:middle
We're going to move
on and talk about some

00:34:22.106 --> 00:34:28.295 A:middle
of the more advanced
features of the API.

00:34:28.876 --> 00:34:31.616 A:middle
We'll start by looking at
some more override methods

00:34:31.616 --> 00:34:32.636 A:middle
on your principal class.

00:34:34.085 --> 00:34:36.565 A:middle
We'll move on and talk
about group conversations

00:34:37.666 --> 00:34:40.656 A:middle
and finally we'll discuss
how to identify the sender

00:34:40.656 --> 00:34:41.726 A:middle
of a particular message.

00:34:43.835 --> 00:34:48.426 A:middle
First, when the user
sends a message,

00:34:48.426 --> 00:34:51.596 A:middle
we realize that your app may wan
to know that this has happened.

00:34:52.585 --> 00:34:55.266 A:middle
For instance, if you're a game
and the user plays a move,

00:34:55.976 --> 00:34:58.726 A:middle
we need to know when to update
our model to record that move

00:34:58.726 --> 00:34:59.896 A:middle
and that should really
only happen

00:34:59.896 --> 00:35:01.736 A:middle
when the message
is actually sent.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.896 --> 00:35:01.736 A:middle
when the message
is actually sent.

00:35:03.896 --> 00:35:06.246 A:middle
So, we have a
didStartSendingMessage method

00:35:06.686 --> 00:35:12.366 A:middle
on the principal class
and this is called

00:35:12.366 --> 00:35:13.946 A:middle
when the user taps
the send button.

00:35:14.516 --> 00:35:15.446 A:middle
Now, this is important.

00:35:15.706 --> 00:35:16.996 A:middle
That message-- that
does not mean

00:35:16.996 --> 00:35:20.096 A:middle
that the message has actually
been sent or delivered.

00:35:20.386 --> 00:35:23.226 A:middle
All it means is the user
has hit the Send button

00:35:23.226 --> 00:35:28.336 A:middle
and it communicates the
intent to send this message.

00:35:29.056 --> 00:35:31.916 A:middle
We also have, similarly,
a didCancelSending.

00:35:32.906 --> 00:35:34.936 A:middle
This happens when the
user taps the cross

00:35:35.336 --> 00:35:38.626 A:middle
in the top right hand corner of
the message bubble on the shelf.

00:35:39.526 --> 00:35:41.646 A:middle
didCancelSending is your
opportunity to clean

00:35:41.646 --> 00:35:44.046 A:middle
up any resources that have
been accumulated during the

00:35:44.046 --> 00:35:45.306 A:middle
composition of that message.

00:35:45.956 --> 00:35:49.866 A:middle
And lastly we have
didRecieveMessage.

00:35:51.256 --> 00:35:56.416 A:middle
didRecieveMessage happens-- is
called when your app is running

00:35:56.896 --> 00:36:01.556 A:middle
or active and a message has come
in from one of the recipient--


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:56.896 --> 00:36:01.556 A:middle
or active and a message has come
in from one of the recipient--

00:36:01.556 --> 00:36:03.316 A:middle
one of the participants
in the conversation.

00:36:03.316 --> 00:36:08.246 A:middle
And it's a-- this is useful,
for example, if your app has--

00:36:08.336 --> 00:36:11.006 A:middle
if your user is editing
a session message

00:36:11.006 --> 00:36:13.146 A:middle
and another message comes
in on the same session,

00:36:13.456 --> 00:36:17.006 A:middle
it's an updated state and
you need to update the UI

00:36:17.006 --> 00:36:18.316 A:middle
that represents this state.

00:36:19.316 --> 00:36:22.176 A:middle
So, let's move on and talk
about group conversations.

00:36:22.676 --> 00:36:25.296 A:middle
iMessage apps are going to be
used in group conversations,

00:36:25.606 --> 00:36:26.776 A:middle
so you're going to
have to consider

00:36:26.776 --> 00:36:29.266 A:middle
that when you're building them.

00:36:29.866 --> 00:36:32.516 A:middle
We have here an example
conversation

00:36:32.516 --> 00:36:35.466 A:middle
between three friends:
Amber, Ben, and Chris.

00:36:36.766 --> 00:36:41.336 A:middle
Ben's getting ice cream
for everyone and he sent

00:36:41.336 --> 00:36:43.396 A:middle
out a question to
Amber and Chris.

00:36:43.766 --> 00:36:45.766 A:middle
Which topping do you-- would
you like on your ice cream?

00:36:46.016 --> 00:36:47.776 A:middle
Chocolate sauce or sprinkles?

00:36:48.286 --> 00:36:53.756 A:middle
Amber is going to reply
with chocolate sauce

00:36:54.726 --> 00:36:57.446 A:middle
and Chris here is going
to reply with sprinkles.

00:36:59.056 --> 00:37:01.966 A:middle
Both users send these messages
at exactly the same time.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.056 --> 00:37:01.966 A:middle
Both users send these messages
at exactly the same time.

00:37:02.526 --> 00:37:09.206 A:middle
Let's focus a little bit now
on Ben and see what happens

00:37:09.206 --> 00:37:10.966 A:middle
on his device as
these messages arrive.

00:37:11.486 --> 00:37:17.306 A:middle
First, Amber's reply is going
to arrive on Ben's device

00:37:17.486 --> 00:37:19.226 A:middle
and this is followed
very shortly afterwards

00:37:19.456 --> 00:37:20.516 A:middle
by the reply from Chris.

00:37:20.516 --> 00:37:26.526 A:middle
So, you note Amber's reply was
turned into a summary message

00:37:26.846 --> 00:37:28.356 A:middle
and Chris's reply is shown

00:37:28.356 --> 00:37:30.056 A:middle
as the last bubble
in this conversation.

00:37:30.606 --> 00:37:34.956 A:middle
This could just as easily have
happened the other way around

00:37:37.156 --> 00:37:40.836 A:middle
and we should note that only
the tapped message is available

00:37:40.836 --> 00:37:45.286 A:middle
to your iMessage app, so
we don't really have access

00:37:45.286 --> 00:37:47.456 A:middle
to Amber's reply in our example.

00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:49.776 A:middle
How do we deal with this?

00:37:49.866 --> 00:37:51.896 A:middle
Well, right now we're
recommending

00:37:51.896 --> 00:37:54.586 A:middle
that you store state in
the cloud and this means

00:37:54.586 --> 00:37:57.166 A:middle
that the URL property of the
MSMessage that's passed to

00:37:57.166 --> 00:38:02.076 A:middle
and from the participants in
the conversation only needs to--


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:57.166 --> 00:38:02.076 A:middle
and from the participants in
the conversation only needs to--

00:38:02.076 --> 00:38:05.846 A:middle
only needs to take a token
that represents the session

00:38:07.806 --> 00:38:10.166 A:middle
and then you receive the
current state of the session

00:38:10.796 --> 00:38:13.066 A:middle
when the user taps on a message.

00:38:13.376 --> 00:38:15.076 A:middle
And when a user sends a message,

00:38:15.076 --> 00:38:16.486 A:middle
you should push the
current state

00:38:16.486 --> 00:38:20.046 A:middle
of the session up to the cloud.

00:38:20.736 --> 00:38:22.906 A:middle
Moving on, we're going to
talk about sender identifiers.

00:38:23.516 --> 00:38:29.126 A:middle
Here we have a conversation

00:38:29.516 --> 00:38:31.116 A:middle
between Amber, Ben,
and Chris again.

00:38:31.706 --> 00:38:35.706 A:middle
In this scenario,
Amber has replied

00:38:36.876 --> 00:38:38.386 A:middle
with a preference
for chocolate sauce.

00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:40.066 A:middle
Chris has not yet replied.

00:38:42.456 --> 00:38:46.816 A:middle
Focusing again on Ben's
device, we have a message here

00:38:46.816 --> 00:38:52.396 A:middle
and we don't know who to
attribute it to, but we can find

00:38:52.506 --> 00:38:55.316 A:middle
out some information about that.

00:38:55.316 --> 00:38:59.686 A:middle
Now, what we have here are some
sender participant identifiers--

00:38:59.996 --> 00:39:01.846 A:middle
sorry, let me rephrase that.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.996 --> 00:39:01.846 A:middle
sorry, let me rephrase that.

00:39:01.946 --> 00:39:04.816 A:middle
What we have here are some
participant identifiers.

00:39:05.656 --> 00:39:08.456 A:middle
Apple is very, very
concerned about user privacy

00:39:08.516 --> 00:39:12.156 A:middle
and we really very highly value
the privacy of our customers,

00:39:12.476 --> 00:39:14.576 A:middle
so we don't expose
contact information

00:39:14.576 --> 00:39:17.806 A:middle
at all to iMessage apps.

00:39:18.346 --> 00:39:20.926 A:middle
Instead, we provide these
participant identifiers.

00:39:22.486 --> 00:39:25.626 A:middle
On Ben's device, he has a
local participant identifier

00:39:25.756 --> 00:39:29.846 A:middle
and this is a UUID that
represents Ben on this device.

00:39:31.056 --> 00:39:34.766 A:middle
He also has two remote
participant identifiers.

00:39:35.766 --> 00:39:39.336 A:middle
These represent the
other participants

00:39:39.336 --> 00:39:40.226 A:middle
in the conversation.

00:39:40.316 --> 00:39:41.406 A:middle
In this case, we have two.

00:39:41.406 --> 00:39:42.956 A:middle
We have Amber and we have Chris.

00:39:43.006 --> 00:39:46.606 A:middle
Looking at the incoming message,

00:39:46.646 --> 00:39:48.946 A:middle
we see that the message
has a sender identifier

00:39:49.516 --> 00:39:51.176 A:middle
and this will map to one

00:39:51.176 --> 00:39:54.466 A:middle
of the local participant
identifiers in Ben's list.

00:39:56.036 --> 00:39:59.526 A:middle
Moving back to the big
picture, looking at Amber

00:39:59.526 --> 00:40:06.276 A:middle
and Chris's device, the sending
messages have sender identifiers


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:59.526 --> 00:40:06.276 A:middle
and Chris's device, the sending
messages have sender identifiers

00:40:06.346 --> 00:40:12.716 A:middle
and these map to the local
identifier on each device

00:40:12.716 --> 00:40:14.266 A:middle
that sent that message.

00:40:14.836 --> 00:40:22.246 A:middle
You can use these identifiers
to get a handle on the number

00:40:22.246 --> 00:40:23.856 A:middle
of participants in
a conversation.

00:40:25.066 --> 00:40:26.886 A:middle
You can attribute
messages to a sender

00:40:26.886 --> 00:40:28.566 A:middle
so once you've received
one message

00:40:28.656 --> 00:40:30.306 A:middle
with a particular
sender identifier

00:40:30.306 --> 00:40:32.716 A:middle
and you receive a second
with the same identifier,

00:40:32.986 --> 00:40:34.526 A:middle
you know they've come
from the same user.

00:40:35.986 --> 00:40:40.586 A:middle
They can also be used in
conjunction with a web service.

00:40:41.156 --> 00:40:44.266 A:middle
They can be used to
help establish identity.

00:40:45.526 --> 00:40:46.356 A:middle
And one more thing.

00:40:48.466 --> 00:40:51.116 A:middle
You can use these identifiers
or the string representation

00:40:51.116 --> 00:40:55.336 A:middle
of these identifiers prefixed
with a dollar sign in any

00:40:55.336 --> 00:40:56.636 A:middle
of the text passed

00:40:56.636 --> 00:40:58.956 A:middle
to the MessageTemplateLayout's
text properties.

00:40:59.476 --> 00:41:02.806 A:middle
You can also use-- similarly,
you can use these identifiers


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.476 --> 00:41:02.806 A:middle
You can also use-- similarly,
you can use these identifiers

00:41:02.806 --> 00:41:06.296 A:middle
in the text passed to the
Messages sumamaryText.

00:41:07.656 --> 00:41:10.936 A:middle
When Messages displays the UI
for the bubbles with this type

00:41:10.936 --> 00:41:14.766 A:middle
of formatting in their text,
it will replace the identifiers

00:41:14.766 --> 00:41:17.396 A:middle
with the contact
name of the person

00:41:17.396 --> 00:41:23.456 A:middle
that their identifier maps to.

00:41:26.156 --> 00:41:30.916 A:middle
These identifiers are
unique on each device.

00:41:31.256 --> 00:41:33.326 A:middle
If you noticed on the
earlier slide, every device

00:41:33.326 --> 00:41:35.376 A:middle
for every person the
identifier was different.

00:41:37.356 --> 00:41:40.716 A:middle
And they're scoped to the
install of the iMessage app

00:41:40.716 --> 00:41:42.766 A:middle
and what I mean by this is

00:41:42.766 --> 00:41:45.936 A:middle
that the identifiers themselves
will be stable over time,

00:41:47.486 --> 00:41:50.356 A:middle
but if the user removes
your iMessage app

00:41:50.356 --> 00:41:52.176 A:middle
and then later reinstalls it,

00:41:52.906 --> 00:41:56.016 A:middle
you'll get a completely
different set of identifiers

00:41:56.016 --> 00:41:57.776 A:middle
within the same conversation.

00:41:58.366 --> 00:42:02.806 A:middle
You can get the sender
participant identifier


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:58.366 --> 00:42:02.806 A:middle
You can get the sender
participant identifier

00:42:02.806 --> 00:42:06.176 A:middle
from an MSMessage using the
senderParticipantIdentifier

00:42:06.176 --> 00:42:10.736 A:middle
property and you can get the
local participant identifier via

00:42:10.736 --> 00:42:14.236 A:middle
conversation using the
localParticipantIdentifier

00:42:14.236 --> 00:42:14.696 A:middle
property.

00:42:16.326 --> 00:42:19.746 A:middle
And you can get the list of
remote participant identifiers

00:42:19.746 --> 00:42:21.976 A:middle
from the
remoteParticipantIdentifier

00:42:28.236 --> 00:42:28.456 A:middle
property.

00:42:30.046 --> 00:42:33.946 A:middle
So, that wraps our more
advanced topics on the API.

00:42:33.946 --> 00:42:37.886 A:middle
We're going to talk a little bit
more about supported platforms.

00:42:39.366 --> 00:42:44.006 A:middle
Interactive messages will be
delivered on these platforms:

00:42:44.006 --> 00:42:47.136 A:middle
watchOS 3, macOS
Sierra, and iOS 10.

00:42:47.956 --> 00:42:51.626 A:middle
Of these platforms, only iOS 10
will actually generate messages.

00:42:53.026 --> 00:42:55.916 A:middle
On macOS Sierra, the user
can click on a bubble

00:42:55.916 --> 00:43:00.106 A:middle
in the conversation
transcript and the URL passed


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:55.916 --> 00:43:00.106 A:middle
in the conversation
transcript and the URL passed

00:43:00.106 --> 00:43:04.456 A:middle
to the Messages URL property
will be opened with Safari.

00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:08.656 A:middle
That will only be if it's
an https or http URL.

00:43:09.706 --> 00:43:13.426 A:middle
On watch, you can hand off
interactive messages to a device

00:43:13.426 --> 00:43:23.616 A:middle
where you're able
to compose a reply.

00:43:24.726 --> 00:43:28.316 A:middle
We also support some
fallback for older platforms.

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:32.566 A:middle
These messages will be
delivered to watchOS 2, iOS 10--

00:43:32.566 --> 00:43:36.426 A:middle
iOS 9, and OS 10.11,
but they'll be delivered

00:43:36.426 --> 00:43:37.456 A:middle
in a fallback format.

00:43:37.596 --> 00:43:39.086 A:middle
There's two separate messages.

00:43:39.996 --> 00:43:42.316 A:middle
The first one will be
the image as provided

00:43:42.316 --> 00:43:43.376 A:middle
in the template layout.

00:43:44.326 --> 00:43:48.996 A:middle
The second one will be a URL
as provided in the message.

00:43:49.836 --> 00:43:53.216 A:middle
Now, again note if this is
an https URL, we'll send it.

00:43:53.606 --> 00:43:55.186 A:middle
If it's a data URL, we won't.

00:43:56.036 --> 00:44:00.076 A:middle
So, we only-- we'll only
send the https or http URLs


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:56.036 --> 00:44:00.076 A:middle
So, we only-- we'll only
send the https or http URLs

00:44:00.076 --> 00:44:01.286 A:middle
in the fallback message.

00:44:01.866 --> 00:44:05.776 A:middle
So, that wraps up our talk.

00:44:06.596 --> 00:44:08.946 A:middle
In summary, we have-- this week,

00:44:09.006 --> 00:44:12.556 A:middle
we've introduced the Messages
framework, iMessage apps.

00:44:13.166 --> 00:44:17.976 A:middle
In the first part of this talk,
Bhaskar and Lily introduced us

00:44:18.256 --> 00:44:20.306 A:middle
to sticker packs
and showed us how

00:44:20.306 --> 00:44:23.416 A:middle
to create simple iMessage apps
that create sticker content.

Today, we've created
iMessage apps

00:44:26.966 --> 00:44:30.636 A:middle
that send interactive
content and we've talked

00:44:30.636 --> 00:44:32.516 A:middle
about how they work
in group conversations

00:44:32.516 --> 00:44:35.586 A:middle
and a few other things.

00:44:35.996 --> 00:44:38.476 A:middle
Now I'm really excited to
see what you guys go out

00:44:38.476 --> 00:44:39.876 A:middle
and make with this API.

00:44:39.876 --> 00:44:45.426 A:middle
I can't wait to see what you
produce and that-- that's it.
