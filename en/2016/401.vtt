00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:25.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, good morning.

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:26.676 A:middle
Thanks.

00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:30.586 A:middle

00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:33.256 A:middle
Welcome to What's
New in Xcode Signing.

00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:36.566 A:middle
Signing your apps
can be complicated.

00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:37.886 A:middle
We understand this.

00:00:38.426 --> 00:00:40.016 A:middle
And what you need to know is,

00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:44.816 A:middle
in Xcode 8 we've made it really
easy and fast to manage signing.

00:00:45.496 --> 00:00:46.646 A:middle
In fact, it's automatic.

00:00:47.316 --> 00:00:50.766 A:middle
And on the other hand,
if you want 100% control

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.206 A:middle
over what Xcode does and
when it signs your apps,

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:55.466 A:middle
you now have that as an option.

00:00:55.816 --> 00:00:59.146 A:middle
And Xcode won't modify
or create profiles.

[ Applause ]

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:09.606 A:middle
Signing identifies you to users.

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:13.546 A:middle
And they know that when they
get your app, it came from you

00:01:13.546 --> 00:01:16.896 A:middle
and it hasn't been
tampered with.

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:19.786 A:middle
Signing also prevents
spoofing your apps.

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:23.426 A:middle
When you register your bundle
ID with the developer website,

00:01:23.886 --> 00:01:28.346 A:middle
another developer team can't
come along and use that one.

00:01:28.536 --> 00:01:32.186 A:middle
Signing also allows
access to system services

00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:34.326 A:middle
like iCloud internet payments.

00:01:34.836 --> 00:01:38.746 A:middle
We're going to go over
four things today.

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:41.256 A:middle
We're going to start
out by talking

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:43.156 A:middle
about the fundamentals
of signing.

00:01:44.386 --> 00:01:47.426 A:middle
What do you need in
order to sign your apps?

00:01:48.296 --> 00:01:51.766 A:middle
After that, we'll talk
about some exciting changes

00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:55.326 A:middle
that we've made involving
setting up new machines

00:01:55.326 --> 00:01:56.576 A:middle
with signing certificates.

00:01:57.046 --> 00:02:00.436 A:middle
Today, you have to do things
like sync private keys.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:57.046 --> 00:02:00.436 A:middle
Today, you have to do things
like sync private keys.

00:02:00.436 --> 00:02:03.106 A:middle
Or revoke and recreate
certificates.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:06.806 A:middle
And that's a thing of the past.

00:02:06.806 --> 00:02:11.316 A:middle
Yeah [applause] you're
going to love that.

00:02:11.316 --> 00:02:13.266 A:middle
And after that, we're
going to introduce you

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:18.446 A:middle
to some new workflows that makes
managing signing really easy.

00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:21.936 A:middle
And we'll finish by talking
about some best practices

00:02:22.206 --> 00:02:23.626 A:middle
with setting up your projects.

00:02:24.146 --> 00:02:27.206 A:middle
Let's talk about
the fundamentals.

00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:31.086 A:middle
Now when Xcode builds
and signs your app,

00:02:31.426 --> 00:02:34.866 A:middle
behind the scenes it uses
a tool called codesign.

00:02:35.886 --> 00:02:38.776 A:middle
Now if you're new, you don't
need to think about this.

00:02:39.176 --> 00:02:41.416 A:middle
Xcode does this for
you automatically.

00:02:41.936 --> 00:02:44.536 A:middle
And if you're experienced, you
might be wondering, signing.

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:45.786 A:middle
How does it work?

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:47.906 A:middle
Well, we use this codesign tool.

00:02:48.356 --> 00:02:51.766 A:middle
And what codesign does is,
it takes your app's bundle

00:02:51.956 --> 00:02:53.786 A:middle
and applies a code seal.

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:57.336 A:middle
And this allows the
system to detect changes

00:02:57.336 --> 00:03:00.466 A:middle
that have been made after
the app has been signed.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:57.336 --> 00:03:00.466 A:middle
that have been made after
the app has been signed.

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:06.046 A:middle
So if someone messes with your
app, it won't install or launch.

00:03:07.296 --> 00:03:12.026 A:middle
Codesign also applies a code
signature to the application.

00:03:12.336 --> 00:03:13.976 A:middle
So it can be identified.

00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:17.066 A:middle
And people know where
the app came from.

00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:24.096 A:middle
There are three things that you
need in order to sign your apps.

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:27.386 A:middle
The first thing is a
signing certificate.

00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:31.786 A:middle
Signing certificates establish
your identity as a developer.

00:03:33.156 --> 00:03:36.376 A:middle
Provisioning profiles
are all about your apps,

00:03:36.556 --> 00:03:37.846 A:middle
and they grant permissions.

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:43.136 A:middle
And entitlements declare
support for capabilities.

00:03:43.336 --> 00:03:44.876 A:middle
Like iCloud or Wallet.

00:03:46.676 --> 00:03:48.006 A:middle
So certificates.

00:03:48.526 --> 00:03:50.206 A:middle
These are issued by Apple.

00:03:50.556 --> 00:03:53.946 A:middle
And this is important because
the device needs a trust chain

00:03:53.946 --> 00:03:57.206 A:middle
back to Apple so it
can install the app.

00:03:58.016 --> 00:04:00.526 A:middle
And certificates
come in two forms.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.016 --> 00:04:00.526 A:middle
And certificates
come in two forms.

00:04:00.916 --> 00:04:02.666 A:middle
You have development
certificates,

00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:04.626 A:middle
which are for build and run.

00:04:05.026 --> 00:04:07.216 A:middle
And you have distribution
certificates.

00:04:07.586 --> 00:04:08.466 A:middle
Which are used

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:10.716 A:middle
for authentication
with iTunes Connect.

00:04:11.296 --> 00:04:14.296 A:middle
Or, if these are
enterprise certificates,

00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:16.435 A:middle
it's for distribution to users.

00:04:18.296 --> 00:04:22.466 A:middle
And all signing certificates
require a private key.

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:25.556 A:middle
This private key has
to be in the keychain

00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:28.026 A:middle
if you want to sign your apps.

00:04:28.206 --> 00:04:31.446 A:middle
And the private key for
a certificate is created

00:04:31.446 --> 00:04:33.276 A:middle
when the certificate
gets generated.

00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:36.206 A:middle
And so it's very important
to have this private key.

00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:38.836 A:middle
And it's worth noting here

00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:42.056 A:middle
that Apple never has a
copy of your private keys.

00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:45.036 A:middle
You can't go to the developer
website and download them.

00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:49.216 A:middle
Now the good news
is, in Xcode 8,

00:04:49.396 --> 00:04:51.836 A:middle
for your development
certificates, you don't need

00:04:51.836 --> 00:04:53.066 A:middle
to worry about this anymore.

00:04:53.186 --> 00:04:57.106 A:middle
And we'll talk more
about that in a second.

00:04:57.226 --> 00:05:00.176 A:middle
Provisioning profiles
are also issued by Apple.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:57.226 --> 00:05:00.176 A:middle
Provisioning profiles
are also issued by Apple.

00:05:00.666 --> 00:05:03.646 A:middle
And in contrast to
certificates which are all

00:05:03.646 --> 00:05:05.616 A:middle
about your identity
as a developer,

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:08.826 A:middle
the profiles are
all about your apps.

00:05:10.956 --> 00:05:14.856 A:middle
Profiles allow access to
things like running on devices.

00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:18.396 A:middle
There's a list of
identifiers in a profile.

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:22.156 A:middle
And at install time, the
device runs down those list

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:24.936 A:middle
of identifiers to check
if yours is included.

00:05:25.176 --> 00:05:28.006 A:middle
And if it is, you
can install the app.

00:05:28.896 --> 00:05:33.066 A:middle
Profiles also allow
access to entitlements.

00:05:33.506 --> 00:05:36.406 A:middle
There's a white list of
entitlements in a profile.

00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:38.436 A:middle
And if you want to
use an entitlement,

00:05:38.606 --> 00:05:40.416 A:middle
it has to be in that list.

00:05:41.436 --> 00:05:43.116 A:middle
Now once again, if you're new,

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:44.666 A:middle
you don't need to
think about this.

00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:46.296 A:middle
Xcode handles this for you.

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:48.196 A:middle
And if you're experienced,

00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:51.366 A:middle
you might be wondering
why you need a new profile

00:05:51.516 --> 00:05:54.246 A:middle
when you add an entitlement
to your app.

00:05:54.406 --> 00:05:57.186 A:middle
It's because of that white list.

00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.256 A:middle
Speaking of entitlements,

00:05:59.936 --> 00:06:02.766 A:middle
entitlements declare
support for capabilities.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.936 --> 00:06:02.766 A:middle
entitlements declare
support for capabilities.

00:06:03.566 --> 00:06:06.826 A:middle
And fundamentally an
entitlement is just a string

00:06:07.326 --> 00:06:08.826 A:middle
with an associated value.

00:06:08.996 --> 00:06:10.206 A:middle
Like a string or a bowl.

00:06:10.736 --> 00:06:13.736 A:middle
And these are defined
per target.

00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:16.886 A:middle
So if your app uses one
set of capabilities,

00:06:17.286 --> 00:06:20.416 A:middle
and your app extension uses
another set, that's fine.

00:06:20.896 --> 00:06:25.966 A:middle
And Xcode has a dedicated editor
for working with capabilities,

00:06:26.336 --> 00:06:27.716 A:middle
called the Capabilities tab.

00:06:28.316 --> 00:06:32.366 A:middle
And the Capabilities tab will
manage your entitlements PLIST

00:06:32.596 --> 00:06:34.186 A:middle
in the configuration details.

00:06:34.566 --> 00:06:36.976 A:middle
So you don't have to visit
the developer website.

00:06:37.206 --> 00:06:39.336 A:middle
You can do it all
from within Xcode.

00:06:39.876 --> 00:06:44.576 A:middle
So those are the things you
need in order to sign your apps.

00:06:45.026 --> 00:06:48.066 A:middle
Now what happens when Xcode
goes to sign your app?

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.326 A:middle
It needs to know which
certificate to use,

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:51.586 A:middle
and which provision and profile.

00:06:52.106 --> 00:06:55.616 A:middle
The way that works is,
Xcode will build your app.

00:06:56.276 --> 00:07:00.066 A:middle
And then it looks at the list
of certificates on your machine.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:56.276 --> 00:07:00.066 A:middle
And then it looks at the list
of certificates on your machine.

00:07:00.376 --> 00:07:04.286 A:middle
And it picks the newest one that
matches your development team.

00:07:05.236 --> 00:07:07.866 A:middle
Xcode then looks at
the list of profiles.

00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:11.326 A:middle
And it picks the newest one
that matches your bundle ID.

00:07:11.326 --> 00:07:14.056 A:middle
And these two things
are brought together.

00:07:14.446 --> 00:07:16.776 A:middle
The profile is embedded
in the app.

00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:19.856 A:middle
And the certificate
is used with Code Sign

00:07:20.076 --> 00:07:21.206 A:middle
to apply the code seal.

00:07:21.736 --> 00:07:25.266 A:middle
So that's a quick
run through of some

00:07:25.266 --> 00:07:28.286 A:middle
of the fundamentals
of signing your apps.

00:07:29.346 --> 00:07:32.866 A:middle
Let's talk now about the
changes we've made for setting

00:07:32.866 --> 00:07:35.166 A:middle
up new machines with
signing certificates.

00:07:36.536 --> 00:07:38.926 A:middle
So who's seen this before?

00:07:39.716 --> 00:07:42.956 A:middle
Yeah. Your account
already has a certificate,

00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:45.016 A:middle
and Xcode offers to reset it.

00:07:45.536 --> 00:07:49.096 A:middle
So what happens when
you click that button?

00:07:49.246 --> 00:07:50.816 A:middle
Yeah, so what happens
is it gets rid

00:07:50.816 --> 00:07:52.706 A:middle
of your current cert
and makes a new one.

00:07:53.586 --> 00:07:54.636 A:middle
And why is this?

00:07:55.046 --> 00:07:57.616 A:middle
Well, your development
account has a limit

00:07:57.616 --> 00:07:59.436 A:middle
of one signing certificate.

00:07:59.916 --> 00:08:03.646 A:middle
And if you have a single
machine, this works great.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.916 --> 00:08:03.646 A:middle
And if you have a single
machine, this works great.

00:08:04.036 --> 00:08:05.156 A:middle
The cert is created.

00:08:05.156 --> 00:08:08.356 A:middle
You have a private key that's
generated, and it stays

00:08:08.356 --> 00:08:10.296 A:middle
in your keychain
and it just works.

00:08:11.236 --> 00:08:14.556 A:middle
Now what happens if
you have a second Mac?

00:08:15.056 --> 00:08:17.926 A:middle
Well, to build and sign
on that second Mac,

00:08:18.426 --> 00:08:20.896 A:middle
you need a signing
cert and a private key.

00:08:21.346 --> 00:08:26.206 A:middle
And you can either sync that
over using keychain access

00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:29.386 A:middle
or Xcode and import the
private key on the second Mac.

00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:32.796 A:middle
Or you can create a new
signing certificate.

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:35.905 A:middle
But that first requires
getting rid of the old one.

00:08:36.635 --> 00:08:39.816 A:middle
And now you can build on the
second Mac, but you can't build

00:08:39.816 --> 00:08:41.035 A:middle
on your first Mac anymore.

00:08:41.635 --> 00:08:44.836 A:middle
And it's easy to repeat this
process, and go back and forth

00:08:44.836 --> 00:08:47.946 A:middle
between being able to build on
one machine, and not being able

00:08:47.946 --> 00:08:49.116 A:middle
to build on another one.

00:08:49.116 --> 00:08:51.956 A:middle
And this is really
frustrating and cumbersome.

00:08:52.856 --> 00:08:55.536 A:middle
Well, the good news
is in Xcode 8,

00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:58.636 A:middle
you can now have multiple
development certificates.

00:08:59.316 --> 00:09:00.146 A:middle
So -- yeah [applause].

00:08:59.316 --> 00:09:00.146 A:middle
So -- yeah [applause].

00:09:03.806 --> 00:09:07.206 A:middle
Each of your machines can have
their own dedicated certificate

00:09:07.406 --> 00:09:08.396 A:middle
and private key.

00:09:08.616 --> 00:09:11.566 A:middle
So you never have to sync
private keys for development,

00:09:12.316 --> 00:09:13.966 A:middle
and you don't have
to see this again.

00:09:16.136 --> 00:09:20.026 A:middle
These changes apply just for
development certificates.

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:23.336 A:middle
Your distribution certs
still have a limit of one

00:09:23.336 --> 00:09:24.436 A:middle
that you need to manage.

00:09:26.216 --> 00:09:30.286 A:middle
These are created both through
Xcode or the developer websites.

00:09:30.686 --> 00:09:34.476 A:middle
And these are created
in Xcode 8 and later.

00:09:36.186 --> 00:09:39.526 A:middle
And if you have an old copy
of Xcode on your machine,

00:09:39.976 --> 00:09:43.156 A:middle
and you create one of these new
signing certificates, it works.

00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:45.466 A:middle
They're 100% backwards
compatible.

00:09:46.026 --> 00:09:50.436 A:middle
So that's what we've changed

00:09:50.666 --> 00:09:53.226 A:middle
about signing certificates
in Xcode 8.

00:09:54.436 --> 00:09:56.966 A:middle
I'd like to turn the stage
over to my colleague, Itai,

00:09:56.966 --> 00:09:59.136 A:middle
who's going to tell you
about the new workflows

00:09:59.686 --> 00:10:02.296 A:middle
in Xcode 8 [applause].


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.686 --> 00:10:02.296 A:middle
in Xcode 8 [applause].

00:10:04.346 --> 00:10:05.286 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

00:10:06.996 --> 00:10:09.436 A:middle
So Joshua's walked us
through the fundamental pieces

00:10:09.486 --> 00:10:11.306 A:middle
that are involved in
signing your applications.

00:10:12.086 --> 00:10:15.806 A:middle
You need a signing certificate
and a provisioning profile

00:10:16.086 --> 00:10:18.516 A:middle
that matches your device
and your app's entitlements.

00:10:19.136 --> 00:10:21.656 A:middle
But many of you also
have app extensions.

00:10:21.896 --> 00:10:22.686 A:middle
Watch apps.

00:10:22.916 --> 00:10:24.266 A:middle
Or embedded frameworks
in your app.

00:10:25.066 --> 00:10:27.586 A:middle
And each of those brings its
own signing requirements.

00:10:28.796 --> 00:10:31.216 A:middle
All this can add up to
a complicated picture,

00:10:31.346 --> 00:10:33.226 A:middle
where signing becomes
a bit of a puzzle.

00:10:34.276 --> 00:10:37.406 A:middle
And fitting all the pieces
together can be pretty

00:10:37.406 --> 00:10:38.326 A:middle
difficult sometimes.

00:10:39.786 --> 00:10:42.986 A:middle
So Xcode for many releases
has provided assistance

00:10:42.986 --> 00:10:43.996 A:middle
to help make this easier.

00:10:45.126 --> 00:10:49.416 A:middle
In Xcode 7, the Fix Issue button
would appear whenever Xcode

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:53.536 A:middle
detected that something was
wrong with your signing setup.

00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:57.166 A:middle
Now sometimes clicking on Fix
Issue would fix the problem,

00:10:57.406 --> 00:10:59.056 A:middle
and you can return to
developing your app.

00:10:59.756 --> 00:11:01.776 A:middle
But a lot of the times it
wouldn't fix the problem.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.756 --> 00:11:01.776 A:middle
But a lot of the times it
wouldn't fix the problem.

00:11:01.776 --> 00:11:04.146 A:middle
Or you had to click
it multiple times.

00:11:04.986 --> 00:11:08.466 A:middle
And in all cases, Xcode
wasn't very communicative

00:11:08.466 --> 00:11:09.866 A:middle
about what the issue was.

00:11:11.056 --> 00:11:13.066 A:middle
What it did when you
clicked Fix Issue, and why.

00:11:13.766 --> 00:11:16.046 A:middle
And really, if Xcode knew
how to solve the problem,

00:11:16.546 --> 00:11:18.586 A:middle
why did it need to interrupt
your development workflow

00:11:18.586 --> 00:11:21.076 A:middle
and make you click a button?

00:11:21.196 --> 00:11:24.196 A:middle
Interacting with signing
in Xcode 7 often felt

00:11:24.196 --> 00:11:25.966 A:middle
like you were talking
to a black box.

00:11:25.966 --> 00:11:28.926 A:middle
You couldn't see inside, but you
could mash the red panic button

00:11:28.926 --> 00:11:29.956 A:middle
whenever you got frustrated.

00:11:30.706 --> 00:11:32.606 A:middle
So that didn't work
out very well.

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:35.796 A:middle
And in Xcode 8 we've gotten
rid of the Fix Issue button.

00:11:35.796 --> 00:11:38.286 A:middle
But we've also done a lot more.

00:11:39.516 --> 00:11:42.896 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:43.396 --> 00:11:46.006 A:middle
We fully redesigned how
signing works in Xcode 8.

00:11:46.986 --> 00:11:48.856 A:middle
There's a brand new
signing infrastructure

00:11:49.456 --> 00:11:51.876 A:middle
which is much faster and
more reliable than before.

00:11:53.116 --> 00:11:55.346 A:middle
On top of that, we
built new workflows,

00:11:55.676 --> 00:11:58.056 A:middle
and a new user interface
in the General tab.

00:11:58.406 --> 00:12:01.736 A:middle
So you can see and manage
your signing settings all


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.406 --> 00:12:01.736 A:middle
So you can see and manage
your signing settings all

00:12:01.736 --> 00:12:02.576 A:middle
in one place.

00:12:03.086 --> 00:12:06.696 A:middle
Then we took a look at
how Xcode communicates

00:12:06.696 --> 00:12:08.196 A:middle
with you about signing issues.

00:12:09.586 --> 00:12:12.316 A:middle
A lot of the error messages
were not very actionable

00:12:12.316 --> 00:12:13.066 A:middle
or communicative.

00:12:13.446 --> 00:12:15.366 A:middle
And so we've revised
them all in Xcode8.

00:12:15.816 --> 00:12:17.446 A:middle
So that you see much
more helpful

00:12:17.446 --> 00:12:19.846 A:middle
and actionable information
when something goes wrong.

00:12:21.336 --> 00:12:23.146 A:middle
And for those of you
who are very curious

00:12:23.146 --> 00:12:24.996 A:middle
about what Xcode
does on your behalf

00:12:25.466 --> 00:12:27.016 A:middle
when it fixes a signing problem.

00:12:27.516 --> 00:12:28.866 A:middle
We've added new status
reporting.

00:12:28.866 --> 00:12:31.886 A:middle
So you can always see exactly
what Xcode did and why.

00:12:32.546 --> 00:12:36.426 A:middle
So as Joshua mentioned
at the beginning,

00:12:36.696 --> 00:12:40.356 A:middle
there are two new ways of
working with signing in Xcode 8.

00:12:40.846 --> 00:12:43.176 A:middle
The first one is
automatic signing.

00:12:44.636 --> 00:12:47.396 A:middle
Now automatic signing has
been fully redesigned,

00:12:47.586 --> 00:12:50.316 A:middle
and it takes care of all of
your signing needs for you.

00:12:51.816 --> 00:12:55.416 A:middle
You'll never need to create a
profile, or update your app ID.

00:12:55.646 --> 00:12:57.496 A:middle
And Xcode will do it
all in the background.

00:12:57.656 --> 00:12:59.536 A:middle
So while you're developing
your application,

00:12:59.906 --> 00:13:01.816 A:middle
Xcode will keep your
signing up to date.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.906 --> 00:13:01.816 A:middle
Xcode will keep your
signing up to date.

00:13:04.906 --> 00:13:06.726 A:middle
For those of you who
want full control

00:13:06.726 --> 00:13:08.336 A:middle
over how your application
is signed,

00:13:08.736 --> 00:13:10.506 A:middle
you can enable customized
signing.

00:13:11.426 --> 00:13:15.046 A:middle
In this mode, Xcode will
never create or modify one

00:13:15.046 --> 00:13:16.526 A:middle
of your provisioning profiles.

00:13:16.906 --> 00:13:18.736 A:middle
And it will never change
your signing settings.

00:13:19.956 --> 00:13:21.606 A:middle
So let's take a look
at how these work

00:13:21.606 --> 00:13:22.576 A:middle
in a little bit more detail.

00:13:22.576 --> 00:13:24.276 A:middle
Starting with automatic signing.

00:13:25.876 --> 00:13:27.826 A:middle
When you create a new project,

00:13:28.246 --> 00:13:30.316 A:middle
automatic signing
will be on by default.

00:13:31.276 --> 00:13:32.856 A:middle
But if you're an
experienced developer,

00:13:32.856 --> 00:13:36.196 A:middle
or you're opening an existing
project, you can enable it

00:13:36.196 --> 00:13:38.646 A:middle
in the General tab in
this new signing UI.

00:13:40.136 --> 00:13:42.236 A:middle
All you have to do
is check the box.

00:13:43.616 --> 00:13:46.006 A:middle
And then tell Xcode
your development team.

00:13:47.196 --> 00:13:50.346 A:middle
From that point on, Xcode will
take care of creating profiles

00:13:50.626 --> 00:13:52.096 A:middle
and signing certificates
for you.

00:13:52.356 --> 00:13:54.806 A:middle
And it will even show you
the profile and certificate

00:13:54.806 --> 00:13:57.626 A:middle
that will be used when
you build your app.

00:13:58.676 --> 00:14:01.256 A:middle
So what sorts of things will
automatic signing do for you?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.676 --> 00:14:01.256 A:middle
So what sorts of things will
automatic signing do for you?

00:14:01.686 --> 00:14:04.686 A:middle
Well, it will create your
signing certificates.

00:14:05.296 --> 00:14:06.766 A:middle
So if you're developing
an iOS app,

00:14:07.076 --> 00:14:09.696 A:middle
it'll create an iOS
development certificate for you.

00:14:09.696 --> 00:14:14.206 A:middle
It will also create and update
your app ID's and profiles.

00:14:14.616 --> 00:14:15.256 A:middle
And it does this

00:14:15.256 --> 00:14:17.926 A:middle
in the background while you're
working on your application.

00:14:18.176 --> 00:14:19.976 A:middle
So you can stay focused
on developments.

00:14:20.486 --> 00:14:24.286 A:middle
But there are still
some instances

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:25.806 A:middle
where Xcode 8 will prompt you.

00:14:26.286 --> 00:14:29.186 A:middle
In particular, when you connect
a new device to your Mac.

00:14:30.196 --> 00:14:31.826 A:middle
One that's not already
registered

00:14:31.826 --> 00:14:32.876 A:middle
on your development team.

00:14:33.756 --> 00:14:35.926 A:middle
Xcode will ask you
before it registers it.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:38.816 A:middle
Because we know device limits
are finite, and you want

00:14:38.816 --> 00:14:40.896 A:middle
to have full control over
how those are allocated.

00:14:41.376 --> 00:14:46.166 A:middle
And finally, if you're
curious about what Xcode does

00:14:46.166 --> 00:14:47.676 A:middle
on your behalf in
the background,

00:14:48.056 --> 00:14:49.336 A:middle
you can view the signing report

00:14:50.216 --> 00:14:51.946 A:middle
to see exactly what
Xcode did, and why.

00:14:53.016 --> 00:14:55.786 A:middle
So let me show you how this
all works on the demo machine.

00:14:56.036 --> 00:15:00.746 A:middle
So I'm going to show you
automatic signing on Xcode 8,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:56.036 --> 00:15:00.746 A:middle
So I'm going to show you
automatic signing on Xcode 8,

00:15:00.746 --> 00:15:03.466 A:middle
using a brand new iOS app.

00:15:05.456 --> 00:15:06.536 A:middle
I'll hit Next.

00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:09.216 A:middle
And I'll give this a name.

00:15:10.496 --> 00:15:12.756 A:middle
I'm not a great cook,
so I like easy recipes.

00:15:13.876 --> 00:15:16.586 A:middle
Now the first thing I'd
like to call your attention

00:15:16.586 --> 00:15:20.766 A:middle
to in the new project assistant
is the new popup labeled "Team".

00:15:21.216 --> 00:15:23.126 A:middle
When you create your project,

00:15:23.436 --> 00:15:26.176 A:middle
you can immediately choose the
development team that you'd

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:27.286 A:middle
like to use for signing.

00:15:27.826 --> 00:15:28.966 A:middle
And from that point on,

00:15:29.306 --> 00:15:31.106 A:middle
your project will
already be configured

00:15:31.106 --> 00:15:33.496 A:middle
for automatic signing
with the right team.

00:15:34.186 --> 00:15:36.846 A:middle
So I'll just hit Next.

00:15:37.506 --> 00:15:41.196 A:middle
And I'll create this
on my desktop.

00:15:42.396 --> 00:15:44.306 A:middle
So what did Xcode just do?

00:15:44.866 --> 00:15:46.296 A:middle
It created a brand new project,

00:15:46.616 --> 00:15:48.916 A:middle
and automatic signing
is turned on by default.

00:15:50.246 --> 00:15:51.466 A:middle
When I created the project,

00:15:51.926 --> 00:15:54.156 A:middle
it immediately generated
the signing certificate

00:15:54.516 --> 00:15:56.156 A:middle
and a provisioning
profile for me.

00:15:57.556 --> 00:15:59.746 A:middle
I can zoom in on here
so it's easier to see.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:04.136 --> 00:16:05.786 A:middle
If I'd like to change
my development team,

00:16:06.256 --> 00:16:07.556 A:middle
I can also do that there.

00:16:11.356 --> 00:16:14.406 A:middle
So that's how easy it is to
set up a brand new project.

00:16:15.206 --> 00:16:17.316 A:middle
I can immediately build
and run on a device.

00:16:17.366 --> 00:16:19.106 A:middle
I never had to click "Fix Issue"

00:16:19.416 --> 00:16:21.396 A:middle
or configure any
profiles myself.

00:16:21.746 --> 00:16:24.856 A:middle
All I did was create a new
project, and tell Xcode my team.

00:16:25.566 --> 00:16:27.506 A:middle
But let's make this a
little more interesting.

00:16:29.076 --> 00:16:32.636 A:middle
As Joshua mentioned earlier,
you can use the Capabilities tab

00:16:33.386 --> 00:16:35.066 A:middle
to enable platform
features that you'd

00:16:35.066 --> 00:16:36.586 A:middle
like to use, like Cloud Kit.

00:16:37.136 --> 00:16:38.846 A:middle
So let's do that in
this application.

00:16:40.176 --> 00:16:42.396 A:middle
We'll go to the Capabilities
tab.

00:16:43.426 --> 00:16:45.166 A:middle
And here I see all
the capabilities

00:16:45.416 --> 00:16:46.556 A:middle
that my app can support.

00:16:47.086 --> 00:16:50.156 A:middle
And all I have to do is flip
this switch to turn one on.

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:55.826 A:middle
I'd like to use Cloud Kit
here, and Push Notifications.

00:16:57.726 --> 00:17:01.456 A:middle
So when I did that, Xcode made
a few changes to my project.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:57.726 --> 00:17:01.456 A:middle
So when I did that, Xcode made
a few changes to my project.

00:17:01.766 --> 00:17:02.846 A:middle
It linked frameworks.

00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:04.516 A:middle
It modified my Entitlement's
file.

00:17:04.516 --> 00:17:07.616 A:middle
But it also communicated
with the developer portal

00:17:08.146 --> 00:17:09.406 A:middle
to download a new profile.

00:17:10.806 --> 00:17:12.536 A:middle
And now I can build
and run my app.

00:17:12.536 --> 00:17:15.435 A:middle
And I can immediately
start using these features.

00:17:15.435 --> 00:17:17.695 A:middle
Again, I never had to
click a Fix Issue button,

00:17:17.945 --> 00:17:19.856 A:middle
or type in any entitlements
myself.

00:17:21.026 --> 00:17:23.715 A:middle
Now, I happen to know that
Xcode downloaded a new profile,

00:17:23.715 --> 00:17:25.066 A:middle
because I'm an Xcode engineer.

00:17:25.646 --> 00:17:27.236 A:middle
But most of you probably aren't.

00:17:27.915 --> 00:17:31.656 A:middle
So if you're curious about what
Xcode did, you can always click

00:17:31.656 --> 00:17:33.176 A:middle
over to the Reports Navigator.

00:17:34.176 --> 00:17:36.916 A:middle
Where you'll see a brand new
report called Update Signing.

00:17:37.806 --> 00:17:41.506 A:middle
Whenever Xcode resolves a
signing problem for you,

00:17:41.996 --> 00:17:43.796 A:middle
one of these reports
will be created.

00:17:44.376 --> 00:17:46.036 A:middle
Let's take a look at
the most recent one

00:17:46.306 --> 00:17:48.096 A:middle
to see what it contains.

00:17:49.936 --> 00:17:51.956 A:middle
And I'll zoom in to
make that easier to see.

00:17:53.516 --> 00:17:56.246 A:middle
So here we can see Xcode
diagnosed a problem.

00:17:56.886 --> 00:18:00.286 A:middle
And I can see more information
about that problem by selecting


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:56.886 --> 00:18:00.286 A:middle
And I can see more information
about that problem by selecting

00:18:00.286 --> 00:18:01.736 A:middle
that row and expanding it.

00:18:03.206 --> 00:18:06.226 A:middle
So Xcode's telling me my
existing profile doesn't

00:18:06.226 --> 00:18:07.066 A:middle
support iCloud.

00:18:08.286 --> 00:18:09.936 A:middle
And immediately below that,

00:18:09.936 --> 00:18:12.656 A:middle
I can see that it created
a new profile for my app.

00:18:13.966 --> 00:18:17.106 A:middle
So that's how easy it is to
see exactly what Xcode does

00:18:17.106 --> 00:18:19.216 A:middle
on my behalf whenever
it fixes a problem.

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:29.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:30.046 --> 00:18:31.446 A:middle
Now there are a few more
things you should know

00:18:31.446 --> 00:18:32.636 A:middle
about automatic signing.

00:18:33.886 --> 00:18:36.396 A:middle
The first one is that it
does development signing.

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:39.546 A:middle
Distribution is handled
through a different workflow;

00:18:39.546 --> 00:18:41.696 A:middle
which Joshua will describe
a little bit later.

00:18:42.936 --> 00:18:46.396 A:middle
And it's limited to Xcode
created provisioning profile.

00:18:47.216 --> 00:18:49.846 A:middle
These of course are profiles
Xcode makes on your behalf,

00:18:50.166 --> 00:18:51.456 A:middle
and it keeps them up-to-date

00:18:51.636 --> 00:18:53.316 A:middle
as you're working
on your application.

00:18:53.916 --> 00:18:58.876 A:middle
And as a result of these,
you can use automatic signing

00:18:59.046 --> 00:19:00.406 A:middle
without ever having to worry


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.046 --> 00:19:00.406 A:middle
without ever having to worry

00:19:00.406 --> 00:19:04.246 A:middle
about your distribution signing
assets being touched by Xcode.

00:19:05.086 --> 00:19:06.616 A:middle
So your distribution certificate

00:19:06.616 --> 00:19:09.036 A:middle
and provisioning profile
will never be modified

00:19:09.036 --> 00:19:10.096 A:middle
by automatic signing.

00:19:12.136 --> 00:19:14.436 A:middle
So automatic signing.

00:19:14.436 --> 00:19:16.736 A:middle
It's been completely
redesigned in Xcode 8.

00:19:17.366 --> 00:19:20.886 A:middle
It stays out of your way,
and it manages signing.

00:19:21.216 --> 00:19:23.266 A:middle
So you can focus on
what's really important,

00:19:23.266 --> 00:19:26.376 A:middle
which is developing your app.

00:19:27.306 --> 00:19:29.296 A:middle
Now let's take a look at
the other side of the fence.

00:19:29.356 --> 00:19:30.486 A:middle
Customized signing.

00:19:31.516 --> 00:19:34.536 A:middle
As you'll recall, this is a
mode where you have full control

00:19:34.536 --> 00:19:35.816 A:middle
over how your app is signed.

00:19:36.416 --> 00:19:40.706 A:middle
You can enable customized
signing

00:19:41.076 --> 00:19:43.726 A:middle
by unchecking the checkbox
in the General tab.

00:19:44.866 --> 00:19:46.426 A:middle
And once you've done that,

00:19:46.426 --> 00:19:49.516 A:middle
Xcode will let you choose
different provisioning profiles

00:19:49.516 --> 00:19:51.286 A:middle
for each of your
build configurations.

00:19:52.516 --> 00:19:55.576 A:middle
This is really handy if you have
a continuous integration system.

00:19:55.576 --> 00:19:57.896 A:middle
Or you need different
profiles for free

00:19:57.896 --> 00:19:59.076 A:middle
and paid versions of your app.

00:19:59.506 --> 00:20:00.876 A:middle
Now you have the
power to do that.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.506 --> 00:20:00.876 A:middle
Now you have the
power to do that.

00:20:01.286 --> 00:20:04.086 A:middle
And you can configure this
all within the General tab.

00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:06.626 A:middle
You don't have to visit the
Build Settings Editor anymore.

00:20:09.146 --> 00:20:10.946 A:middle
So this is a really
powerful new UI

00:20:10.946 --> 00:20:12.856 A:middle
for configuring your
signing settings.

00:20:13.336 --> 00:20:15.276 A:middle
But we wanted to take
this one step further.

00:20:16.146 --> 00:20:19.096 A:middle
Those of you who have manually
chosen profiles in the past,

00:20:19.406 --> 00:20:22.476 A:middle
have probably run into
some weird installation

00:20:22.476 --> 00:20:25.366 A:middle
or runtime issues usually
having to do with entitlements.

00:20:25.956 --> 00:20:28.956 A:middle
And we wanted Xcode to give
you more helpful information

00:20:28.956 --> 00:20:31.466 A:middle
about that before you
run into those issues.

00:20:32.426 --> 00:20:35.086 A:middle
So we've added new
error reporting right

00:20:35.086 --> 00:20:36.176 A:middle
within the General tab.

00:20:36.626 --> 00:20:38.956 A:middle
And you can see this right
alongside your settings.

00:20:39.316 --> 00:20:41.216 A:middle
So it's easier to
choose the right profile.

00:20:42.496 --> 00:20:46.166 A:middle
Here I can see that my profile
doesn't support the capabilities

00:20:46.166 --> 00:20:47.256 A:middle
that my app is using.

00:20:47.556 --> 00:20:49.646 A:middle
So I know exactly what
I need to do in order

00:20:49.646 --> 00:20:50.646 A:middle
to resolve the problem.

00:20:53.236 --> 00:20:58.566 A:middle
In addition, I can
see more information

00:20:58.566 --> 00:20:59.956 A:middle
about my provisioning profile

00:20:59.956 --> 00:21:02.146 A:middle
by clicking the profile
info button.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.956 --> 00:21:02.146 A:middle
by clicking the profile
info button.

00:21:03.326 --> 00:21:05.736 A:middle
And here I can see
a lot of details.

00:21:05.736 --> 00:21:07.556 A:middle
Like when my profile
was created.

00:21:08.126 --> 00:21:09.676 A:middle
Which capabilities it supports.

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:12.536 A:middle
And again, it's easy to
tell when there's a problem,

00:21:12.776 --> 00:21:15.286 A:middle
exactly what I need
to do to resolve it.

00:21:17.936 --> 00:21:20.366 A:middle
Now customized signing
is limited

00:21:20.366 --> 00:21:22.156 A:middle
to manually created profiles.

00:21:22.616 --> 00:21:24.826 A:middle
These are profiles
that you or someone

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:27.966 A:middle
on your team has created
using the developer website.

00:21:28.566 --> 00:21:30.456 A:middle
And Xcode will never
modify these.

00:21:30.946 --> 00:21:34.176 A:middle
And you can choose
any type of profile.

00:21:34.176 --> 00:21:37.236 A:middle
So as I mentioned, if you want
to use development profiles

00:21:37.236 --> 00:21:40.376 A:middle
for some build configurations,
and distribution profiles

00:21:40.376 --> 00:21:45.766 A:middle
for others, you're
free to do that.

00:21:45.976 --> 00:21:47.236 A:middle
Now this is a really cool thing.

00:21:47.236 --> 00:21:49.956 A:middle
Especially for those of
you experienced developers

00:21:49.956 --> 00:21:52.126 A:middle
who have manually chosen
profiles in the past.

00:21:52.936 --> 00:21:53.876 A:middle
There's a new build setting

00:21:53.876 --> 00:21:56.736 A:middle
in Xcode 8 called
Provisioning Profile Specifier.

00:21:57.736 --> 00:22:00.196 A:middle
And what this does is it
references your profiles


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:57.736 --> 00:22:00.196 A:middle
And what this does is it
references your profiles

00:22:00.196 --> 00:22:00.836 A:middle
by name.

00:22:02.076 --> 00:22:05.816 A:middle
Now the reason this is a
big deal is because prior

00:22:05.816 --> 00:22:08.516 A:middle
to Xcode 8, Xcode would
reference your profiles

00:22:08.516 --> 00:22:10.296 A:middle
by their unique ID.

00:22:10.696 --> 00:22:12.426 A:middle
Whenever a new developer
joined your team,

00:22:12.426 --> 00:22:13.696 A:middle
or you added a new device,

00:22:14.146 --> 00:22:16.736 A:middle
you'd need to generate a
new version of your profile.

00:22:16.736 --> 00:22:19.246 A:middle
And when you did that,
you'd get a new unique ID.

00:22:19.536 --> 00:22:21.466 A:middle
So then you'd need to
update your project.

00:22:22.756 --> 00:22:26.376 A:middle
Well, now in Xcode 8, since
we reference profiles by name,

00:22:26.826 --> 00:22:29.216 A:middle
all you need to do is
generate a new profile,

00:22:29.676 --> 00:22:31.586 A:middle
and Xcode will automatically
pick it up.

00:22:31.586 --> 00:22:36.326 A:middle
You don't need to update your
project [applause] thank you.

00:22:37.516 --> 00:22:40.396 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:40.896 --> 00:22:41.516 A:middle
So let's take a look

00:22:41.516 --> 00:22:43.806 A:middle
at how customized signing
works on the demo machine.

00:22:50.456 --> 00:22:54.356 A:middle
Okay. I'm going to show you
another app I've been working

00:22:54.356 --> 00:22:55.596 A:middle
on called, Scrapbook.

00:22:56.236 --> 00:22:59.186 A:middle
And let me zoom in on that.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:00.596 --> 00:23:02.936 A:middle
So Scrapbook is set up
for customized signing.

00:23:03.996 --> 00:23:06.166 A:middle
I've chosen different
profiles for the free

00:23:06.166 --> 00:23:07.506 A:middle
and paid versions of my app.

00:23:08.986 --> 00:23:10.226 A:middle
And it's really easy
to configure

00:23:10.226 --> 00:23:11.636 A:middle
that in the General tab.

00:23:12.046 --> 00:23:13.226 A:middle
This is all I had to do.

00:23:13.636 --> 00:23:15.846 A:middle
Just select different
profiles from those pop ups.

00:23:16.726 --> 00:23:18.716 A:middle
And since I don't see
any error messages here,

00:23:19.286 --> 00:23:21.856 A:middle
I already know I can
build and run on a device,

00:23:21.856 --> 00:23:22.886 A:middle
and everything will work.

00:23:24.676 --> 00:23:26.536 A:middle
But as in the earlier demo,

00:23:26.756 --> 00:23:28.456 A:middle
let's make this a
little more interesting.

00:23:29.086 --> 00:23:32.106 A:middle
I'd like to use the Capabilities
tab so I can use iCloud

00:23:32.106 --> 00:23:34.186 A:middle
and Push Notifications
in this app as well.

00:23:35.426 --> 00:23:38.006 A:middle
Now if you've used the
Capabilities tab in the past

00:23:38.446 --> 00:23:40.976 A:middle
with a manually specified
provisioning profile,

00:23:41.546 --> 00:23:43.966 A:middle
you might've noticed that it
sometimes would change your

00:23:43.966 --> 00:23:44.816 A:middle
signing settings.

00:23:44.816 --> 00:23:46.676 A:middle
Or make changes that
you didn't really want.

00:23:47.756 --> 00:23:51.406 A:middle
In Xcode 8, the Capabilities
tab is now safe to use

00:23:51.486 --> 00:23:52.696 A:middle
in customized signing mode.

00:23:53.446 --> 00:23:56.386 A:middle
It'll make the local changes
that are safe to make,

00:23:56.386 --> 00:23:58.816 A:middle
such as updating your
entitlements PLIST.

00:23:59.556 --> 00:24:01.096 A:middle
But it won't touch
your profiles.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.556 --> 00:24:01.096 A:middle
But it won't touch
your profiles.

00:24:01.286 --> 00:24:04.426 A:middle
It'll just tell you what steps
you need to take manually

00:24:04.456 --> 00:24:06.066 A:middle
in order to resolve
those problems.

00:24:06.536 --> 00:24:07.626 A:middle
So let's take a look at that.

00:24:12.076 --> 00:24:16.256 A:middle
I'll click on Capabilities,
and then turn on iCloud

00:24:16.886 --> 00:24:18.096 A:middle
and Push Notifications.

00:24:22.046 --> 00:24:25.216 A:middle
Now Xcode is showing me
checkmarks next to the steps

00:24:25.216 --> 00:24:26.356 A:middle
that it was able to complete.

00:24:26.826 --> 00:24:29.756 A:middle
And little error icons next
to the steps that I still need

00:24:29.756 --> 00:24:31.496 A:middle
to complete on the
developer website.

00:24:31.606 --> 00:24:36.056 A:middle
I can see more information
about this in the General tab.

00:24:37.556 --> 00:24:39.626 A:middle
I'll zoom in on that.

00:24:42.646 --> 00:24:44.306 A:middle
And if you look at
that error message,

00:24:44.306 --> 00:24:47.206 A:middle
you can see Xcode's telling
me my selected profile doesn't

00:24:47.206 --> 00:24:49.076 A:middle
support iCloud and
Push Notifications.

00:24:49.676 --> 00:24:51.806 A:middle
That's kind of obvious
since I just enabled those.

00:24:52.436 --> 00:24:53.666 A:middle
But it's really clear.

00:24:53.666 --> 00:24:56.196 A:middle
I can tell exactly what I need
to do to fix this problem.

00:24:56.706 --> 00:24:58.776 A:middle
Whereas in the past, if I
had tried to build and run,

00:24:59.126 --> 00:25:01.886 A:middle
my app either wouldn't install
or wouldn't run correctly.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.126 --> 00:25:01.886 A:middle
my app either wouldn't install
or wouldn't run correctly.

00:25:04.016 --> 00:25:06.046 A:middle
And finally, if I want
to see more information,

00:25:06.426 --> 00:25:08.096 A:middle
I can click the Profile
Info button.

00:25:08.656 --> 00:25:12.626 A:middle
And Xcode will show me more
detail about my profile.

00:25:12.626 --> 00:25:15.676 A:middle
Like the capabilities that it
supports and those it doesn't.

00:25:16.076 --> 00:25:18.876 A:middle
So again, it's easy to
see exactly what I need

00:25:18.876 --> 00:25:20.056 A:middle
to do to fix a problem.

00:25:21.026 --> 00:25:22.146 A:middle
So let's go fix this one.

00:25:23.406 --> 00:25:26.296 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier, in
customized signing mode,

00:25:26.406 --> 00:25:28.676 A:middle
Xcode won't modify
profiles for me.

00:25:29.106 --> 00:25:31.776 A:middle
I need to visit the developer
website to do it myself.

00:25:33.156 --> 00:25:36.336 A:middle
So I'll open up the
developer website and click

00:25:36.336 --> 00:25:38.456 A:middle
on Certificates,
Identifiers, and Profiles.

00:25:39.296 --> 00:25:42.426 A:middle
The first thing I need to
do is update my app ID.

00:25:43.546 --> 00:25:44.766 A:middle
So I'll select App IDs.

00:25:45.576 --> 00:25:48.536 A:middle
And I'll choose the app ID I've
already created for this app.

00:25:49.446 --> 00:25:52.246 A:middle
This shows me all the
capabilities that are available.

00:25:52.646 --> 00:25:53.666 A:middle
I'll hit, Edit.

00:25:54.616 --> 00:25:57.026 A:middle
Scroll down and turn on iCloud.

00:25:58.466 --> 00:26:01.576 A:middle
Now this alert message that
I'm seeing is reminding me


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.466 --> 00:26:01.576 A:middle
Now this alert message that
I'm seeing is reminding me

00:26:01.576 --> 00:26:03.296 A:middle
that after I update my app ID,

00:26:03.546 --> 00:26:05.236 A:middle
I also need to download
a new version

00:26:05.236 --> 00:26:06.556 A:middle
of my provisioning profile.

00:26:07.106 --> 00:26:08.006 A:middle
So I'll just hit, Okay.

00:26:08.566 --> 00:26:13.586 A:middle
And then I'd like to enable
the newer version of iCloud.

00:26:13.586 --> 00:26:14.806 A:middle
So I'll turn that on.

00:26:15.396 --> 00:26:17.596 A:middle
And again I'm reminded
that I need a new profile.

00:26:18.146 --> 00:26:21.616 A:middle
So I'll click, Okay.

00:26:21.806 --> 00:26:24.136 A:middle
Scroll down and turn
on Push Notifications.

00:26:25.076 --> 00:26:25.906 A:middle
And now I'm done.

00:26:27.476 --> 00:26:29.466 A:middle
The next step is
updating my profile.

00:26:29.726 --> 00:26:31.196 A:middle
So I'm going to click
on Development.

00:26:32.466 --> 00:26:35.286 A:middle
And you'll see the two scrapbook
profiles are now marked

00:26:35.286 --> 00:26:35.906 A:middle
as invalid.

00:26:36.506 --> 00:26:38.456 A:middle
That's because I've made
changes to my app ID.

00:26:38.756 --> 00:26:40.896 A:middle
But I haven't regenerated
the profiles yet.

00:26:41.466 --> 00:26:42.386 A:middle
So they're out of date.

00:26:43.286 --> 00:26:45.496 A:middle
Let's update the
Scrapbook Free profile.

00:26:46.116 --> 00:26:48.976 A:middle
I'll select it and click, Edit.

00:26:49.456 --> 00:26:51.306 A:middle
And I can scroll down
through all of this.

00:26:51.306 --> 00:26:54.656 A:middle
I'm not making changes
to certs or to devices.

00:26:55.386 --> 00:26:56.726 A:middle
And I'll click on Generate.

00:26:57.336 --> 00:26:59.196 A:middle
And then download
the new profile.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:00.316 --> 00:27:03.226 A:middle
Now the very last step is I
need to install this profile

00:27:03.226 --> 00:27:04.846 A:middle
so that Xcode can use it.

00:27:05.176 --> 00:27:08.176 A:middle
I can do that just by clicking
it in the Downloads folder.

00:27:09.896 --> 00:27:11.336 A:middle
So what just happened there?

00:27:12.076 --> 00:27:12.936 A:middle
I'll zoom in on that.

00:27:14.156 --> 00:27:16.866 A:middle
When I clicked on the
profile, Xcode installed it,

00:27:18.016 --> 00:27:20.386 A:middle
and immediately updated
to start using it.

00:27:20.516 --> 00:27:23.366 A:middle
So we can see the errors in
the free build configuration

00:27:23.366 --> 00:27:24.936 A:middle
of my app have disappeared.

00:27:26.576 --> 00:27:28.596 A:middle
You might also have noticed

00:27:28.836 --> 00:27:30.816 A:middle
that I didn't make any
project changes here.

00:27:31.396 --> 00:27:34.056 A:middle
This is provisioning profile
specifier working behind

00:27:34.056 --> 00:27:34.526 A:middle
the scenes.

00:27:35.116 --> 00:27:37.226 A:middle
Once I installed the new
version of the profile,

00:27:37.726 --> 00:27:40.056 A:middle
Xcode just started
using it automatically.

00:27:40.876 --> 00:27:43.296 A:middle
Now I can build and run
the free version of my app,

00:27:43.836 --> 00:27:44.836 A:middle
and everything will work.

00:27:44.836 --> 00:27:46.176 A:middle
I can use iCloud and Push.

00:27:47.726 --> 00:27:48.776 A:middle
But it looks like I still need

00:27:48.776 --> 00:27:50.486 A:middle
to update the premium
version of my app.

00:27:50.946 --> 00:27:53.446 A:middle
Does everybody want to see me do
that on the developer website?

00:27:53.446 --> 00:27:54.606 A:middle
Or we get the idea?

00:27:55.646 --> 00:27:57.896 A:middle
Okay. It's a little bit tedious.

00:27:59.166 --> 00:28:01.216 A:middle
If you were paying
attention to the earlier demo,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.166 --> 00:28:01.216 A:middle
If you were paying
attention to the earlier demo,

00:28:01.216 --> 00:28:03.026 A:middle
you might have noticed
this is actually --

00:28:03.116 --> 00:28:05.876 A:middle
all those steps I just performed
are the exact same steps

00:28:05.876 --> 00:28:08.686 A:middle
that Xcode performed for
me in automatic signing.

00:28:09.266 --> 00:28:11.996 A:middle
So that's customized signing.

00:28:12.326 --> 00:28:15.426 A:middle
A brand new mode in Xcode 8,
where you have full control

00:28:15.426 --> 00:28:16.696 A:middle
over how your app is signed.

00:28:17.176 --> 00:28:19.416 A:middle
Xcode won't interfere
with your settings,

00:28:19.726 --> 00:28:21.206 A:middle
or modify your profiles.

00:28:21.726 --> 00:28:24.336 A:middle
But I'd like to encourage
you all to try

00:28:24.336 --> 00:28:25.546 A:middle
out automatic signing.

00:28:26.646 --> 00:28:28.666 A:middle
It's been completely
redesigned in Xcode 8,

00:28:28.666 --> 00:28:31.066 A:middle
and it's provides a really
seamless development workflow

00:28:31.066 --> 00:28:32.346 A:middle
that I think you'll
really enjoy.

00:28:32.936 --> 00:28:35.626 A:middle
Now I'd like to invite
Joshua back

00:28:35.626 --> 00:28:37.606 A:middle
up to show you some best
practices [applause].

00:28:40.046 --> 00:28:40.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Itai [applause].

00:28:44.046 --> 00:28:47.776 A:middle
So we just saw the new
workflows in Xcode 8

00:28:47.776 --> 00:28:50.826 A:middle
that makes it really easy
and fast to manage signing.

00:28:51.886 --> 00:28:54.486 A:middle
Now I'd like to talk
about some best practices

00:28:54.686 --> 00:28:56.806 A:middle
for managing signing
in your projects.

00:28:58.296 --> 00:29:00.836 A:middle
The first thing is,
use automatic.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.296 --> 00:29:00.836 A:middle
The first thing is,
use automatic.

00:29:01.186 --> 00:29:04.756 A:middle
Automatic is designed to make
your life as easy as possible.

00:29:05.296 --> 00:29:07.436 A:middle
And it works great

00:29:07.436 --> 00:29:10.756 A:middle
with individual developers,
or large teams.

00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:14.526 A:middle
So you should add all of the
developers that work on your app

00:29:14.966 --> 00:29:16.766 A:middle
to your development team.

00:29:17.456 --> 00:29:21.246 A:middle
You should use the Capabilities
tab to manage entitlements.

00:29:21.496 --> 00:29:23.716 A:middle
So you can avoid visiting
the developer website

00:29:23.826 --> 00:29:26.426 A:middle
to configure things
like iCloud containers.

00:29:27.136 --> 00:29:33.296 A:middle
If you use customized signing,
don't set code sign identity.

00:29:33.846 --> 00:29:36.036 A:middle
You have a specific
signing certificate

00:29:36.146 --> 00:29:37.756 A:middle
that is linked to your account.

00:29:38.306 --> 00:29:41.266 A:middle
So if you set this to your
particular signing cert

00:29:41.486 --> 00:29:43.186 A:middle
and someone else
pulls your project,

00:29:43.746 --> 00:29:44.946 A:middle
they won't be able to build.

00:29:45.356 --> 00:29:47.516 A:middle
So you should leave that
with the default value.

00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:51.616 A:middle
Instead of visiting the
Build Settings Editor,

00:29:51.836 --> 00:29:53.116 A:middle
you should use the new UI

00:29:53.296 --> 00:29:55.456 A:middle
in the General tab
of the Target Editor.

00:29:56.186 --> 00:29:59.936 A:middle
This allows you to see more
information about the profile.

00:29:59.936 --> 00:30:04.736 A:middle
And it also correctly sets
the profile specifier by name,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.936 --> 00:30:04.736 A:middle
And it also correctly sets
the profile specifier by name,

00:30:05.016 --> 00:30:07.096 A:middle
so you can avoid churn
in your projects.

00:30:07.656 --> 00:30:11.306 A:middle
You should also use
the Capabilities tab

00:30:11.506 --> 00:30:14.566 A:middle
in Customized Signing Mode to
manage your entitlements PLIST.

00:30:15.036 --> 00:30:19.526 A:middle
And if you use development
signing for all

00:30:19.526 --> 00:30:23.276 A:middle
of your project's configuration,
you should try out automatic.

00:30:23.836 --> 00:30:26.606 A:middle
When you get back to your
Mac, go check that checkbox

00:30:26.606 --> 00:30:30.966 A:middle
in the target editor
and try it out.

00:30:31.726 --> 00:30:34.436 A:middle
When it comes to
distributing your app,

00:30:34.436 --> 00:30:37.306 A:middle
Xcode has a dedicated
workflow for this.

00:30:37.646 --> 00:30:40.576 A:middle
And it's based around
building an archive.

00:30:42.246 --> 00:30:44.396 A:middle
Archives contain a
copy of your app.

00:30:45.736 --> 00:30:47.306 A:middle
And it's important to note

00:30:47.306 --> 00:30:49.306 A:middle
that you should use
development signing.

00:30:50.316 --> 00:30:53.426 A:middle
If you sign your app with
a distribution certificate,

00:30:53.826 --> 00:30:56.296 A:middle
you won't be able to
test the exact bits

00:30:56.296 --> 00:30:57.666 A:middle
that you were trying to develop.

00:30:58.386 --> 00:31:00.746 A:middle
So this should be
development signed.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.386 --> 00:31:00.746 A:middle
So this should be
development signed.

00:31:01.376 --> 00:31:03.636 A:middle
And when it comes time
to distribute that,

00:31:03.936 --> 00:31:05.276 A:middle
when you use the organizer,

00:31:05.626 --> 00:31:09.696 A:middle
Xcode will resign the app using
your development certificate

00:31:09.826 --> 00:31:11.466 A:middle
and provisioning profiles.

00:31:12.356 --> 00:31:14.656 A:middle
And if you clicked
Upload it will go straight

00:31:14.656 --> 00:31:15.436 A:middle
to iTunes connect.

00:31:16.206 --> 00:31:20.406 A:middle
Or if you clicked Export,
you'll get an IPA file or an app

00:31:20.506 --> 00:31:22.316 A:middle
that has been distribution
signed.

00:31:23.456 --> 00:31:28.866 A:middle
So that's the best practice
for distributing your content.

00:31:29.356 --> 00:31:30.746 A:middle
We've covered a few
things today.

00:31:30.746 --> 00:31:33.966 A:middle
We've talked about the new
changes to signing certificates

00:31:34.166 --> 00:31:37.216 A:middle
that makes it really easy
to set up new machines.

00:31:37.936 --> 00:31:40.326 A:middle
We've talked about the
new automatic workflow,

00:31:40.726 --> 00:31:43.896 A:middle
which takes a lot of the pain
out of developing your apps.

00:31:44.756 --> 00:31:47.636 A:middle
And we talked about the new
customized signing mode.

00:31:47.956 --> 00:31:51.016 A:middle
So you can configure your
projects as you see fit.

00:31:51.246 --> 00:31:52.356 A:middle
