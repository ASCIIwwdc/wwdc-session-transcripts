00:00:25.686 --> 00:00:26.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:29.146 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:29.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Oh, please.

00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:32.676 A:middle
My name's Woody.

00:00:32.676 --> 00:00:34.396 A:middle
I work in software
engineering at Apple.

00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:35.926 A:middle
I'd like to welcome
you to the conference,

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:38.306 A:middle
both those of you here in
the room and those of you

00:00:38.306 --> 00:00:40.326 A:middle
who are watching from
home on the live screen.

00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:43.966 A:middle
There's a couple things I'd
like to go through with you

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.206 A:middle
in the next 40 minutes.

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:46.846 A:middle
We're going to take
a look at some ways

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:49.336 A:middle
that you can today start
reducing your technical debt.

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.576 A:middle
Then, we'll take a
look at Asset Catalogs.

00:00:52.426 --> 00:00:54.236 A:middle
We'll take a look at
the new design pattern.

00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:56.576 A:middle
Well, it's not really new but
a design pattern we'd like you

00:00:56.576 --> 00:00:59.116 A:middle
to start using called
Dependency Injection.

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:01.806 A:middle
And in the latter half of the
presentation will be an update

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:01.806 A:middle
And in the latter half of the
presentation will be an update

00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:05.325 A:middle
from my presentation last
year about Live playgrounds.

00:01:06.036 --> 00:01:06.716 A:middle
So, let's get going.

00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:11.296 A:middle
Last year in the session at one
of the labs, I met one of you

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:13.416 A:middle
that was describing a scenario.

00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:15.256 A:middle
You were describing something
that I think is going

00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:18.246 A:middle
to be quite familiar
to many of you.

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:22.006 A:middle
You've got your boss that's
piling on these requests

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:25.676 A:middle
for features and the features
generate revenue and you want

00:01:25.676 --> 00:01:26.916 A:middle
to get paid, so you do that.

00:01:27.756 --> 00:01:29.496 A:middle
Then you've got your
customers and they want

00:01:29.496 --> 00:01:31.136 A:middle
to fix the bugs that
cause them pain.

00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:34.376 A:middle
And you take pride in your work
so you want to do that too.

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:36.596 A:middle
Some technical debt that
you want to resolve.

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:39.486 A:middle
Sometimes I think about building
software as like building

00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:40.826 A:middle
up a pile of Jenga blocks.

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.326 A:middle
In the first version,
it's pretty stable

00:01:42.326 --> 00:01:44.066 A:middle
and you start piling
on stuff on top of it

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:47.346 A:middle
and then it becomes unstable and
begins to fall down after that.

00:01:47.346 --> 00:01:49.826 A:middle
So, you want to take a step
back and maybe resolve some

00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:51.046 A:middle
of the lower-level issues.

00:01:52.676 --> 00:01:57.816 A:middle
With all these things,
you then come to WWDC.

00:01:58.186 --> 00:01:59.626 A:middle
And we pile on new API.

00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:04.586 A:middle
And then we give you
a new version of Swift

00:02:04.586 --> 00:02:06.296 A:middle
and it breaks source
code compatibility

00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:07.906 A:middle
but introduces some
new features.

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:11.276 A:middle
And you were warned, so
don't complain about it.

00:02:12.956 --> 00:02:15.496 A:middle
And then we introduced
new platforms

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:18.266 A:middle
and new extension points and
some of our existing apps

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:19.696 A:middle
like Siri and Messages.

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:23.296 A:middle
And if you want to think of your
role as a developer as a bit

00:02:23.296 --> 00:02:25.706 A:middle
of a run loop with all these
events being pushed into it,

00:02:26.076 --> 00:02:27.136 A:middle
well, you know what
happens then.

00:02:27.136 --> 00:02:27.956 A:middle
There's too much stuff.

00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:30.426 A:middle
So, what you do?

00:02:30.426 --> 00:02:32.406 A:middle
What are some things
that you can start doing

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:34.296 A:middle
to get ready for the fall?

00:02:34.886 --> 00:02:37.456 A:middle
First of all, if you were to
support a deployment target

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:42.656 A:middle
of iOS 8 and 9, you would
cover 95% of the devices.

00:02:42.756 --> 00:02:44.366 A:middle
So, there's really no
need any more to have any

00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:46.056 A:middle
of those deployment
targets set to 7.

00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:47.356 A:middle
Let's get rid of that.

00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:49.826 A:middle
In fact, the general idea is

00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:53.186 A:middle
that you take the current
shipping version, so 9.3,

00:02:53.696 --> 00:02:55.306 A:middle
and then set your
deployment target

00:02:55.306 --> 00:02:57.846 A:middle
to one version back, maybe 8.4.

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:01.346 A:middle
But don't go to 8.3 or 8.2
anymore because then you

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:01.346 A:middle
But don't go to 8.3 or 8.2
anymore because then you

00:03:01.346 --> 00:03:03.306 A:middle
and your customers don't
benefit from the improvements

00:03:03.306 --> 00:03:06.586 A:middle
that we've implemented under
the hood in that 8.4 release.

00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:09.696 A:middle
When we come out with iOS X
in the fall for the public,

00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:14.826 A:middle
set your deployment
target to 9.3.

00:03:15.036 --> 00:03:17.416 A:middle
Next, Issue Navigator.

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:20.386 A:middle
Resolve those issues.

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:22.076 A:middle
Take a look at them
and fix them.

00:03:23.026 --> 00:03:26.496 A:middle
When we tell you that
there's, when we tell you

00:03:26.496 --> 00:03:29.576 A:middle
that there is a deprecated API,
we deprecate API for a variety

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:32.366 A:middle
of reasons, including to
achieve better error handling

00:03:32.616 --> 00:03:34.616 A:middle
or to better, have
better reporting

00:03:34.616 --> 00:03:37.886 A:middle
or to permit more performance
or just add flexibility

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:39.476 A:middle
in the arguments return values.

00:03:39.696 --> 00:03:44.296 A:middle
And there's really no excuse
for not moving on to the new API

00:03:44.406 --> 00:03:45.856 A:middle
because we tell you right there.

00:03:45.856 --> 00:03:47.006 A:middle
It tells you what to use.

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:47.976 A:middle
So, just use that.

00:03:48.086 --> 00:03:48.826 A:middle
Switch over those.

00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:52.716 A:middle
Next, you might decide that you
want to treat warnings as errors

00:03:53.246 --> 00:03:55.536 A:middle
and we've had that for a
while with Objective-C.

00:03:55.926 --> 00:04:00.306 A:middle
But now we also have it
in Xcode 8 for Swift.

00:03:55.926 --> 00:04:00.306 A:middle
But now we also have it
in Xcode 8 for Swift.

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:00.666 A:middle
I know.

00:04:01.016 --> 00:04:02.986 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:02.986 --> 00:04:04.536 A:middle
I think I'm the first
person to tell you that.

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:07.146 A:middle
I really like this idea.

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:08.976 A:middle
I think it's fantastic,
treating warnings as errors,

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:11.806 A:middle
because it forces you and your
team to address the issues.

00:04:12.026 --> 00:04:14.596 A:middle
It's far too easy to
ignore those yellow warnings

00:04:14.596 --> 00:04:16.796 A:middle
and think you'll come back to
them later and then you don't

00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:20.206 A:middle
and that's the whole
technical debt thing.

00:04:20.416 --> 00:04:26.196 A:middle
Also, do you think this would
work if you pitched maybe a 1.0

00:04:26.196 --> 00:04:28.876 A:middle
of a new project, a new
app, and you said your team,

00:04:28.946 --> 00:04:30.666 A:middle
we're going to ship
1.0, but we're not going

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:32.186 A:middle
to have any art work in
it, it's not ready yet.

00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:33.866 A:middle
We're not going to
have any icons in it.

00:04:33.926 --> 00:04:35.106 A:middle
We'll ship it and
we'll get those caught

00:04:35.106 --> 00:04:36.556 A:middle
up in the .1 release.

00:04:37.056 --> 00:04:37.756 A:middle
That would never fly.

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:38.486 A:middle
No one's going to do that,

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.226 A:middle
because this is how users
interact with your app.

00:04:41.726 --> 00:04:44.006 A:middle
Well, actually it's how
many users but not all

00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:45.006 A:middle
of them interact with your app.

00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:48.206 A:middle
Many of them interact with your
app using the accessibility

00:04:48.206 --> 00:04:50.506 A:middle
features that we have built
into the operating systems.

00:04:51.026 --> 00:04:54.876 A:middle
So, why would ship your app with
artwork for people that need it

00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:56.856 A:middle
or want it or use it but then
not have the accessibility

00:04:56.856 --> 00:04:57.576 A:middle
features in there?

00:04:57.876 --> 00:04:58.646 A:middle
That's not fair.

00:04:59.426 --> 00:05:00.946 A:middle
So, resolve some of
the technical debt

00:04:59.426 --> 00:05:00.946 A:middle
So, resolve some of
the technical debt

00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:02.086 A:middle
that comes to accessibility.

00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:03.036 A:middle
Add support for that.

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:05.806 A:middle
We think that the accessibility
support is as much a part

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:08.086 A:middle
of your user interface
as the artwork is.

00:05:12.176 --> 00:05:13.406 A:middle
It's built into Xcode,

00:05:13.686 --> 00:05:15.286 A:middle
so you can use Interface
Builder for that.

00:05:15.576 --> 00:05:17.086 A:middle
It's also easy to
do programmatically.

00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:21.496 A:middle
We have a lot of
locale-aware API.

00:05:22.506 --> 00:05:24.136 A:middle
You should be using those
and that's less code

00:05:24.136 --> 00:05:24.866 A:middle
that you have to write.

00:05:25.506 --> 00:05:26.836 A:middle
That generally isn't
new, though.

00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:28.606 A:middle
But these are.

00:05:29.786 --> 00:05:31.166 A:middle
Dimensions and measurement
formatting.

00:05:31.316 --> 00:05:33.036 A:middle
If you've got recipe
apps or fitness apps

00:05:33.036 --> 00:05:35.226 A:middle
and you've been converting
between metric and imperial

00:05:35.596 --> 00:05:37.536 A:middle
on your own code,
get rid of that code

00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:39.866 A:middle
and use our code that's now
available in the fall release.

00:05:41.176 --> 00:05:46.216 A:middle
We'd like you to support
Peek, Pop and Quick actions.

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:49.346 A:middle
Right? You know, if you
have iPhone 6S right now,

00:05:50.636 --> 00:05:53.286 A:middle
you're probably accustomed
to let's push hard on this

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:54.156 A:middle
and see if it does anything.

00:05:54.316 --> 00:05:54.856 A:middle
No, nothing.

00:05:54.946 --> 00:05:56.586 A:middle
So, let's push hard on that
and see if it does anything.

00:05:56.736 --> 00:05:57.566 A:middle
Well, that one does something.

00:05:57.806 --> 00:05:58.916 A:middle
It's hard to discover.

00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:00.406 A:middle
How awesome would
it be if every app

00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:00.406 A:middle
How awesome would
it be if every app

00:06:00.406 --> 00:06:03.256 A:middle
that we had already
had support for Peek,

00:06:03.256 --> 00:06:04.606 A:middle
Pop and Push and the 3-D touch?

00:06:05.826 --> 00:06:14.756 A:middle
Next. We want you to run
the Swift migrator using the

00:06:14.756 --> 00:06:16.056 A:middle
developer preview of Xcode 8.

00:06:16.056 --> 00:06:19.886 A:middle
If it doesn't migrate your code,
file a bug report and tell us.

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:22.326 A:middle
Then we have an opportunity
to fix that so

00:06:22.326 --> 00:06:24.486 A:middle
that when you run migrator
for real in the fall

00:06:24.776 --> 00:06:27.806 A:middle
on the final release of
Xcode 8, it'll likely work.

00:06:27.806 --> 00:06:31.306 A:middle
If it doesn't work,
we resolve some

00:06:31.306 --> 00:06:32.556 A:middle
of our own technical
debt with our API.

00:06:32.836 --> 00:06:34.106 A:middle
The public interface is the same

00:06:34.106 --> 00:06:36.376 A:middle
but the implementation might
change between releases.

00:06:36.746 --> 00:06:42.096 A:middle
And it could be that the way
you use whatever API is a way

00:06:42.096 --> 00:06:42.966 A:middle
that we didn't expect.

00:06:43.866 --> 00:06:44.896 A:middle
So, you have an edge case.

00:06:45.516 --> 00:06:46.496 A:middle
So, tell us about that too.

00:06:46.666 --> 00:06:48.316 A:middle
This is why we do
these preview releases.

00:06:48.816 --> 00:06:52.256 A:middle
We want you to file bug reports.

00:06:52.796 --> 00:06:55.386 A:middle
The report isn't just
banter in the hallway.

00:06:55.496 --> 00:06:57.776 A:middle
And it's not just
writing on a dev forum

00:06:58.206 --> 00:07:00.136 A:middle
and is not just sending
an email to Apple.

00:06:58.206 --> 00:07:00.136 A:middle
and is not just sending
an email to Apple.

00:07:00.936 --> 00:07:03.926 A:middle
The proper way to file
a bug report is this.

00:07:04.046 --> 00:07:05.416 A:middle
BugReport.Apple.com.

00:07:05.836 --> 00:07:06.496 A:middle
Fill in the blanks.

00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:09.826 A:middle
And then once you do
that, you get a number

00:07:09.826 --> 00:07:11.076 A:middle
and then that's the
number that you go

00:07:11.236 --> 00:07:12.626 A:middle
and post back into
the dev forums.

00:07:12.756 --> 00:07:15.056 A:middle
There's a lot of Apple engineers
that read the dev forums.

00:07:15.216 --> 00:07:17.986 A:middle
We like to hear what you are
saying but when you file,

00:07:17.986 --> 00:07:20.476 A:middle
or when you report an
issue in those groups

00:07:20.556 --> 00:07:23.876 A:middle
and you don't include the bug
report number, it's difficult

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:25.426 A:middle
for us internally to
kind of follow through

00:07:25.426 --> 00:07:25.976 A:middle
and get traction on it.

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:26.976 A:middle
So, do that.

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:36.206 A:middle
Next, you're probably
not a great fan

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:38.286 A:middle
of filing bug reports with us.

00:07:39.316 --> 00:07:41.936 A:middle
Because you've filed
them and then you wait

00:07:41.936 --> 00:07:43.236 A:middle
and nothing seems to happen.

00:07:43.776 --> 00:07:44.686 A:middle
You get nothing back.

00:07:45.416 --> 00:07:48.526 A:middle
In the words of Whitney Houston,
where lonely bug reports go?

00:07:49.196 --> 00:07:51.326 A:middle
Well, they seem to go in
this great big black hole

00:07:51.326 --> 00:07:52.626 A:middle
because you never
get anything back.

00:07:53.436 --> 00:07:56.756 A:middle
Or you think maybe you get
it in front of an engineer

00:07:56.756 --> 00:07:59.786 A:middle
and the engineer kind of
ignores what you're saying.

00:08:01.226 --> 00:08:04.176 A:middle
I want to just assure
you, this is not the case.

00:08:04.536 --> 00:08:05.356 A:middle
One of the first things I did

00:08:05.356 --> 00:08:06.956 A:middle
when I joined Apple
is I did a search

00:08:07.266 --> 00:08:10.456 A:middle
in the bug tracking system,
the issue tracking system,

00:08:10.786 --> 00:08:14.316 A:middle
to find all the issues that I
filed as an external developer.

00:08:14.316 --> 00:08:15.286 A:middle
And a lot of them had traction.

00:08:15.496 --> 00:08:17.186 A:middle
I just didn't have any
feedback from them.

00:08:17.636 --> 00:08:19.346 A:middle
So, I wanted to show you
that if you do file a bug,

00:08:19.436 --> 00:08:20.236 A:middle
we do look at them.

00:08:21.596 --> 00:08:23.476 A:middle
The other thing that I find
is you might spend a lot

00:08:23.476 --> 00:08:24.266 A:middle
of time filing a bug.

00:08:25.306 --> 00:08:27.896 A:middle
A lot of time maybe you're
making some sample code.

00:08:28.196 --> 00:08:29.536 A:middle
You're trying a couple
different devices.

00:08:29.536 --> 00:08:30.596 A:middle
You're checking for regression.

00:08:30.596 --> 00:08:31.736 A:middle
Like, that's great stuff to do.

00:08:31.996 --> 00:08:33.905 A:middle
It takes you maybe half
an hour or maybe an hour,

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:36.316 A:middle
and then you file
it and it comes back

00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:37.056 A:middle
and it says it's a dupe.

00:08:37.846 --> 00:08:39.456 A:middle
And you're like, oh, I
just wasted half an hour,

00:08:39.456 --> 00:08:42.426 A:middle
hour my life for something
that somebody else already did.

00:08:43.416 --> 00:08:45.066 A:middle
So, I just want to
briefly talk about dupes.

00:08:46.456 --> 00:08:49.526 A:middle
Because dupes first of all
are not a voting system.

00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:51.886 A:middle
It's not like if you copy
somebody else's bug verbatim

00:08:52.076 --> 00:08:54.176 A:middle
and you file a new bug with
exactly the same thing and it,

00:08:54.176 --> 00:08:55.806 A:middle
we're going to say oh,
there's another vote for that,

00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:56.646 A:middle
we should fix that first.

00:08:56.646 --> 00:08:57.776 A:middle
It's not quite like that.

00:08:58.876 --> 00:09:00.956 A:middle
What we do do with them though,
even though they're a dupe,

00:08:58.876 --> 00:09:00.956 A:middle
What we do do with them though,
even though they're a dupe,

00:09:01.316 --> 00:09:02.606 A:middle
it just means these
two are related.

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:06.046 A:middle
We need dupes too, not
for voting purposes

00:09:06.356 --> 00:09:09.846 A:middle
but because we can have five
people file the same root bug,

00:09:09.976 --> 00:09:10.666 A:middle
same root issue.

00:09:11.636 --> 00:09:15.576 A:middle
The first four don't give
us enough information

00:09:15.576 --> 00:09:16.246 A:middle
to be able to find it.

00:09:16.906 --> 00:09:20.366 A:middle
But maybe it's your report,
maybe it's your fifth one which,

00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:23.406 A:middle
albeit, is a dupe, but
has the information in it

00:09:23.406 --> 00:09:24.856 A:middle
that we need to find the issue.

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:29.656 A:middle
In fact, an Apple engineer
that's been with the company

00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:36.246 A:middle
for gosh, a couple decades,
made a quip a couple weeks ago.

00:09:36.766 --> 00:09:41.246 A:middle
Paul had said that each bug
report as its host link.

00:09:42.336 --> 00:09:42.706 A:middle
All right.

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.556 A:middle
So, in summary, things
to get going today.

00:09:44.906 --> 00:09:45.566 A:middle
Fix your warnings.

00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:46.746 A:middle
Replace your deprecated API.

00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:48.926 A:middle
Localize your App if
it hasn't already.

00:09:49.896 --> 00:09:51.306 A:middle
Use accessibility.

00:09:52.176 --> 00:09:53.686 A:middle
Or support accessibility rather.

00:09:53.686 --> 00:09:54.646 A:middle
Get Peek and Pop in there.

00:09:54.916 --> 00:09:56.896 A:middle
And then take a look at
the next release of Xcode

00:09:57.116 --> 00:09:58.516 A:middle
and give us some
feedback on that.

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:01.296 A:middle
With that, let's move
onto Asset Catalogs.

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:01.296 A:middle
With that, let's move
onto Asset Catalogs.

00:10:03.646 --> 00:10:06.366 A:middle
It's time to move
onto Asset Catalogs.

00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:09.656 A:middle
For you. So, if you still have
files in your File Navigator

00:10:09.656 --> 00:10:14.306 A:middle
like this, go ahead and get them
into an Asset Catalog like that.

00:10:15.856 --> 00:10:20.336 A:middle
The approach is you add a
catalog from the File menu.

00:10:20.976 --> 00:10:23.956 A:middle
By the way, you don't have
to add just one catalog.

00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:25.956 A:middle
You can have as many catalogs
as you like in the project.

00:10:26.536 --> 00:10:29.936 A:middle
Maybe you're working on an app
and that app is a card game.

00:10:30.586 --> 00:10:34.596 A:middle
So, you have a catalog for
the front images of the cards

00:10:34.596 --> 00:10:36.676 A:middle
and a second catalog for the
back images of the cards.

00:10:36.676 --> 00:10:37.226 A:middle
We can do that.

00:10:38.226 --> 00:10:41.156 A:middle
Another example, you might have
your graphic designer download

00:10:41.156 --> 00:10:42.606 A:middle
Xcode for free from
the App Store

00:10:44.166 --> 00:10:45.566 A:middle
and create the Asset
Catalog for you.

00:10:46.546 --> 00:10:49.556 A:middle
And then send it to you or
check it into a code repository.

00:10:49.756 --> 00:10:50.336 A:middle
We could do that too.

00:10:51.646 --> 00:10:54.576 A:middle
When we copy files into an Asset
Catalog, they are exactly that.

00:10:54.576 --> 00:10:55.186 A:middle
They are copies.

00:10:55.376 --> 00:10:57.356 A:middle
We don't reference the
original location ever.

00:10:57.696 --> 00:10:59.126 A:middle
So, they do participate
in version control.

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:05.016 A:middle
To migrate your project,
you tap the big plus button.

00:11:05.796 --> 00:11:06.976 A:middle
Choose Import From Project.

00:11:07.676 --> 00:11:10.906 A:middle
We're going to give you
a list of all the Assets

00:11:10.906 --> 00:11:14.216 A:middle
that are eligible to be
migrated from the File Navigator

00:11:14.216 --> 00:11:15.456 A:middle
into the Asset Catalog.

00:11:16.006 --> 00:11:18.796 A:middle
There you go.

00:11:19.216 --> 00:11:20.696 A:middle
You migrated your image Assets.

00:11:21.946 --> 00:11:25.326 A:middle
If you previously used
to use the bundle API,

00:11:25.326 --> 00:11:28.086 A:middle
pathForResource etc.,
that doesn't work anymore

00:11:28.086 --> 00:11:29.426 A:middle
because once we compile the app,

00:11:29.716 --> 00:11:31.216 A:middle
the images aren't
free-floating around anymore.

00:11:31.356 --> 00:11:33.556 A:middle
So you won't find anything.

00:11:34.206 --> 00:11:38.486 A:middle
But if you're using image named,
then we'll find them if they're

00:11:38.486 --> 00:11:40.616 A:middle
in an Asset Catalog
and we'll find them

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:43.806 A:middle
if they're just free-floating
in your File Navigator still.

00:11:44.216 --> 00:11:45.406 A:middle
This API has been
around for a while.

00:11:45.576 --> 00:11:48.546 A:middle
This API Image Name has
a lot of advantages above

00:11:48.546 --> 00:11:50.436 A:middle
and beyond just being
able to find content

00:11:50.436 --> 00:11:51.256 A:middle
from an image catalog.

00:11:52.066 --> 00:11:52.766 A:middle
Asset Catalog.

00:11:53.436 --> 00:11:55.726 A:middle
For example, it internally
caches the first time

00:11:55.726 --> 00:11:57.106 A:middle
that you asked for
an image by name.

00:11:57.256 --> 00:11:58.776 A:middle
We load it up, we give
you back a reference.

00:11:58.776 --> 00:12:00.546 A:middle
The second time you ask
for the same image by name,

00:11:58.776 --> 00:12:00.546 A:middle
The second time you ask
for the same image by name,

00:12:00.546 --> 00:12:02.366 A:middle
we just return another
reference to the same thing.

00:12:03.296 --> 00:12:05.966 A:middle
That's not how the
contents of file API works.

00:12:06.116 --> 00:12:07.996 A:middle
Contents of file loads
new images every time.

00:12:08.526 --> 00:12:10.486 A:middle
So, it's much more perform an,
especially when you're scrolling

00:12:10.486 --> 00:12:12.336 A:middle
through a table,
to use image names.

00:12:12.776 --> 00:12:16.766 A:middle
We support multiple
representations of an asset.

00:12:17.096 --> 00:12:21.216 A:middle
So, with image names, you'd
give it a name, the API name.

00:12:22.136 --> 00:12:23.996 A:middle
You'd let the framework
consider the device

00:12:23.996 --> 00:12:25.406 A:middle
that you're running on.

00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:29.456 A:middle
Consider the resolution of the
display, retina, non-retina,

00:12:29.456 --> 00:12:30.736 A:middle
retina on a Plus device.

00:12:31.286 --> 00:12:35.966 A:middle
And possibly other
differentiating factors

00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:39.096 A:middle
for the media assets such as the
amount of memory in the device

00:12:39.486 --> 00:12:42.666 A:middle
or the version of Metal that
is supported in the device.

00:12:43.206 --> 00:12:46.346 A:middle
And you get an image back.

00:12:46.936 --> 00:12:49.806 A:middle
There's two broad kinds
of asset types for images

00:12:49.806 --> 00:12:50.866 A:middle
that you can consider.

00:12:50.866 --> 00:12:51.986 A:middle
We have scaled images.

00:12:52.216 --> 00:12:55.026 A:middle
Those are like PNG's, JPEG's.

00:12:55.026 --> 00:12:58.156 A:middle
And then we have
single vector images

00:12:58.156 --> 00:13:01.236 A:middle
or just vector-based
images, like PDFs or SPG's.

00:12:58.156 --> 00:13:01.236 A:middle
or just vector-based
images, like PDFs or SPG's.

00:13:01.236 --> 00:13:05.406 A:middle
We treat them a little
bit differently.

00:13:05.986 --> 00:13:08.566 A:middle
On an asset by asset basis,
you can say this asset's going

00:13:08.566 --> 00:13:10.996 A:middle
to be vector-based and that
asset's going to be scale.

00:13:12.186 --> 00:13:14.086 A:middle
You do that by specifying
the scale factor.

00:13:14.646 --> 00:13:18.286 A:middle
So, I'm going to talk first
about some of the scaled images

00:13:18.526 --> 00:13:20.546 A:middle
and then move onto the
vector-based images.

00:13:21.276 --> 00:13:24.586 A:middle
For scaled images, in this
example we're asking you

00:13:24.586 --> 00:13:26.806 A:middle
to provide three different
renderings of the artwork

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:30.246 A:middle
from 1X devices,
non-retina, 2X and 3X.

00:13:31.056 --> 00:13:33.446 A:middle
If we don't find, because
you didn't include it,

00:13:34.376 --> 00:13:37.556 A:middle
the 2X and 3X, we'll take the 1X
image and we'll scale it up so

00:13:37.556 --> 00:13:40.116 A:middle
that it becomes, well,
an image that's used

00:13:40.116 --> 00:13:46.246 A:middle
on the higher end devices or
the higher density devices.

00:13:46.346 --> 00:13:49.676 A:middle
Likewise, if you just
provided us with 3X artwork,

00:13:49.676 --> 00:13:51.066 A:middle
we'd scale it down at runtime.

00:13:52.216 --> 00:13:54.346 A:middle
These two scenarios
aren't that great.

00:13:54.586 --> 00:13:56.846 A:middle
In this scenario, if I take
the 1X image and I scale it

00:13:56.846 --> 00:14:00.306 A:middle
up for an iPhone 6S Plus, it's
going to look really jaggy.

00:13:56.846 --> 00:14:00.306 A:middle
up for an iPhone 6S Plus, it's
going to look really jaggy.

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:02.126 A:middle
It's going to have a visual
artifact called aliasing.

00:14:02.156 --> 00:14:04.476 A:middle
It's not very desirable
and the, well,

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:06.566 A:middle
your customers aren't
going to enjoy it.

00:14:07.116 --> 00:14:09.466 A:middle
This one, at first
glance you might think oh,

00:14:09.466 --> 00:14:11.636 A:middle
I'll just provide the 3X artwork
and let you scale it down.

00:14:12.806 --> 00:14:15.066 A:middle
But there's a huge problem
with that because to scale

00:14:15.066 --> 00:14:17.706 A:middle
down a 3X image, we
have to open a 3X image.

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:18.826 A:middle
And it's really big.

00:14:19.676 --> 00:14:23.086 A:middle
And then we take an
extraction of the pixels

00:14:23.086 --> 00:14:25.186 A:middle
and create a scaled-down
version for it.

00:14:26.406 --> 00:14:29.296 A:middle
It's an order, two orders of
magnitude, possibly larger.

00:14:30.396 --> 00:14:31.186 A:middle
So, consider this.

00:14:32.386 --> 00:14:35.466 A:middle
You're on a device
like a 5S, 5C.

00:14:36.226 --> 00:14:37.956 A:middle
There's no need for
3X images on it

00:14:38.566 --> 00:14:40.016 A:middle
but you only provide 3X images.

00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:42.706 A:middle
So, we start off with the
baseline of memory in use.

00:14:43.706 --> 00:14:46.946 A:middle
That's fine, but then we
have to load up the 3X image,

00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:48.806 A:middle
down convert it, get
rid of the 3X image

00:14:48.986 --> 00:14:50.766 A:middle
and keep this scaled-down
version of it,

00:14:51.206 --> 00:14:53.116 A:middle
which just temporarily
creates a memory spike.

00:14:53.116 --> 00:14:56.096 A:middle
And if you're good, it's
probably going to be fine.

00:14:56.096 --> 00:14:57.166 A:middle
But if you good, I mean

00:14:57.166 --> 00:15:01.486 A:middle
if you're lucky it's
going to be fine.

00:14:57.166 --> 00:15:01.486 A:middle
if you're lucky it's
going to be fine.

00:15:01.546 --> 00:15:03.396 A:middle
But let's say you're
scrolling at a table view

00:15:03.586 --> 00:15:05.456 A:middle
and as you're scrolling,
we have to do this a lot.

00:15:05.776 --> 00:15:07.216 A:middle
All of a sudden the
memory utilization

00:15:07.216 --> 00:15:09.426 A:middle
for your app balloons
and then what happens

00:15:09.426 --> 00:15:10.286 A:middle
when you use too much memory?

00:15:11.016 --> 00:15:13.586 A:middle
Anybody know, just
say it out loud.

00:15:13.886 --> 00:15:14.506 A:middle
Yeah, right.

00:15:14.506 --> 00:15:15.556 A:middle
We terminate it.

00:15:15.556 --> 00:15:18.266 A:middle
It's terminated because you
didn't provide the artwork.

00:15:18.466 --> 00:15:19.626 A:middle
So, provide the artwork.

00:15:20.066 --> 00:15:22.826 A:middle
In fact, you can do this
really easily with the task or,

00:15:23.046 --> 00:15:25.186 A:middle
not a task but with
an Automator workflow.

00:15:25.746 --> 00:15:28.456 A:middle
You give it a 3X image, let it
scale it down, give it a name.

00:15:28.456 --> 00:15:29.626 A:middle
Scale it down, give it a name.

00:15:29.706 --> 00:15:31.586 A:middle
Great, throw those all
into your Asset Catalog.

00:15:31.946 --> 00:15:33.706 A:middle
And if you wanted to, you could,

00:15:34.246 --> 00:15:36.916 A:middle
and this is another
best practice.

00:15:36.916 --> 00:15:38.116 A:middle
Use this naming convention,

00:15:38.516 --> 00:15:41.246 A:middle
the non-retina ones is
just a line justify.PNG.

00:15:41.246 --> 00:15:44.266 A:middle
And then add 2X and
add 3X the other two.

00:15:44.936 --> 00:15:46.496 A:middle
And then when you drag
and drop the three of them

00:15:46.496 --> 00:15:49.436 A:middle
into an Asset Catalog, we
detect a naming convention.

00:15:49.436 --> 00:15:51.786 A:middle
We create one asset with the
three different representations

00:15:52.246 --> 00:15:53.806 A:middle
as opposed to three
separate assets.

00:15:55.026 --> 00:15:57.356 A:middle
For Vector Assets,
Vector Assets are amazing

00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:59.856 A:middle
because the file contains a
set of instructions on how

00:15:59.856 --> 00:16:03.356 A:middle
to draw the image as opposed
to having it pre-rasturized.

00:15:59.856 --> 00:16:03.356 A:middle
to draw the image as opposed
to having it pre-rasturized.

00:16:04.176 --> 00:16:06.246 A:middle
This is the same image, not
three different versions of it.

00:16:06.326 --> 00:16:09.326 A:middle
Same image scaled
to different sizes.

00:16:09.476 --> 00:16:10.576 A:middle
When you specify
that you're going

00:16:10.576 --> 00:16:12.346 A:middle
to use single vector scaling,

00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:14.036 A:middle
you're providing one
vector-based image.

00:16:14.196 --> 00:16:16.186 A:middle
And at build time,
we rasterize it

00:16:16.186 --> 00:16:17.556 A:middle
into the different
sizes that we need.

00:16:18.636 --> 00:16:19.796 A:middle
It's much simpler for you.

00:16:19.796 --> 00:16:22.876 A:middle
This is the kind of thing you'd
likely do for toolbar images

00:16:22.876 --> 00:16:24.296 A:middle
and navigation bar images.

00:16:25.616 --> 00:16:27.386 A:middle
There you go, scale
factor single vector.

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:30.576 A:middle
It's also possible
to combine both.

00:16:31.766 --> 00:16:35.976 A:middle
You can set the scale factor
to be vector and scales.

00:16:36.476 --> 00:16:38.416 A:middle
And what you do is you provide
us a vector-based image,

00:16:38.416 --> 00:16:40.536 A:middle
like the limits in
the well called All.

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.706 A:middle
Then, if you want
to do any over-rides

00:16:43.706 --> 00:16:46.406 A:middle
for the other scale factors,
you just provide those

00:16:46.406 --> 00:16:50.766 A:middle
as either other vector images
or PNG's, JPEG scaled images.

00:16:52.206 --> 00:16:54.876 A:middle
Then when we build it, if we see
that you're missing some assets,

00:16:55.016 --> 00:16:57.686 A:middle
we'll just rasterize those
based on the vector image that's

00:16:57.686 --> 00:16:59.986 A:middle
in the All truck well or target.

00:17:01.016 --> 00:17:02.776 A:middle
Otherwise, we'll use the
scaled ones that are provided.

00:17:03.296 --> 00:17:08.306 A:middle
New in Xcode 8, you can
adjust the compression.

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:11.546 A:middle
Come on, you.

00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:13.046 A:middle
You can adjust the compression.

00:17:13.425 --> 00:17:15.286 A:middle
So, we can say for a
JPEG image you want

00:17:15.286 --> 00:17:17.175 A:middle
to use glossy compression
but maybe

00:17:17.175 --> 00:17:18.976 A:middle
for a PNG we don't want
any compression all

00:17:18.976 --> 00:17:21.036 A:middle
because it's going to be
an item in the toolbar.

00:17:21.116 --> 00:17:22.616 A:middle
We don't want to see
any artifacts with that.

00:17:24.026 --> 00:17:26.136 A:middle
Another issue you can resolve
by using Asset Catalogs,

00:17:26.266 --> 00:17:27.826 A:middle
just in case the pitch
isn't strong enough yet,

00:17:28.476 --> 00:17:31.876 A:middle
is to fix the issue or
resolve some issues.

00:17:31.876 --> 00:17:35.166 A:middle
We're referring to
rounded corners.

00:17:36.516 --> 00:17:39.196 A:middle
The issue with rounded
corners is we have adaptive UI.

00:17:39.826 --> 00:17:43.416 A:middle
So, your button might
contain a text label

00:17:43.416 --> 00:17:46.666 A:middle
that fits perfectly well
until the app is run

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:49.026 A:middle
in a different language and
then it changes the size.

00:17:49.556 --> 00:17:51.326 A:middle
And when we change the size
of the button, we still want

00:17:51.326 --> 00:17:54.146 A:middle
to preserve the beautiful
rounded corners on it.

00:17:55.396 --> 00:17:57.136 A:middle
The way you would even
get a rounded button

00:17:57.136 --> 00:17:58.526 A:middle
in the first place is

00:17:58.526 --> 00:18:00.276 A:middle
in Interface Builder
you'd select a button

00:17:58.526 --> 00:18:00.276 A:middle
in Interface Builder
you'd select a button

00:18:00.276 --> 00:18:02.146 A:middle
and specify a background image.

00:18:02.946 --> 00:18:04.296 A:middle
And then we apply that
as the background.

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:10.996 A:middle
In this example, I have an
asset called rounded rectangle

00:18:12.506 --> 00:18:14.696 A:middle
and I apply that as my
background rectangle

00:18:14.696 --> 00:18:16.436 A:middle
but you can see in the
two sizes of the button,

00:18:16.436 --> 00:18:19.986 A:middle
when it's stretched out it's
really horrible looking.

00:18:22.276 --> 00:18:24.446 A:middle
So, one way you can
fix this is the way

00:18:24.446 --> 00:18:25.726 A:middle
that you've been
fixing it all along

00:18:25.726 --> 00:18:27.096 A:middle
which is using Stretchable
Image.

00:18:28.116 --> 00:18:29.726 A:middle
And you say well, I want
to preserve X number

00:18:29.726 --> 00:18:30.686 A:middle
of pixels on both sides.

00:18:32.066 --> 00:18:33.796 A:middle
And that's fine but
one of the themes

00:18:33.796 --> 00:18:36.356 A:middle
of this presentation is
having you write less code

00:18:36.356 --> 00:18:38.546 A:middle
and rely more on the frameworks
and the tools that we provide.

00:18:39.526 --> 00:18:42.376 A:middle
So, instead this is built
into the Asset Editor.

00:18:42.656 --> 00:18:43.566 A:middle
It's called Asset Slicer.

00:18:44.466 --> 00:18:47.616 A:middle
And you can use it to
specify that, the portions

00:18:47.616 --> 00:18:49.366 A:middle
in red, don't stretch these.

00:18:49.996 --> 00:18:51.296 A:middle
Don't distort them.

00:18:51.996 --> 00:18:54.926 A:middle
The portion that's illuminated,
repeat these pixels.

00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:58.356 A:middle
And by doing that, you get
perfect rounded corners

00:18:58.356 --> 00:18:59.596 A:middle
and you don't have to
do any code for it.

00:19:00.636 --> 00:19:02.926 A:middle
This is also something you could
have your graphic designer do

00:19:02.926 --> 00:19:04.226 A:middle
because it's part
of an Asset Catalog.

00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:06.896 A:middle
All right, next up, let's talk

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:09.616 A:middle
about a design pattern
called Dependency Injection.

00:19:10.476 --> 00:19:12.956 A:middle
Let's first of all talk about
what we're kind of fixing

00:19:12.956 --> 00:19:16.126 A:middle
or trying to change
by introducing this.

00:19:16.336 --> 00:19:18.666 A:middle
So, we have UITextField and
it works with the delegate

00:19:18.666 --> 00:19:21.006 A:middle
and the delegate is called
UITextField delegate.

00:19:21.156 --> 00:19:23.276 A:middle
Fine. And in it, it
contains methods that relate

00:19:23.276 --> 00:19:25.436 A:middle
to text fields, like
textFieldShouldBeginEditing.

00:19:26.196 --> 00:19:29.976 A:middle
Okay? We have WCSession.

00:19:30.446 --> 00:19:31.566 A:middle
And WCSession delegate.

00:19:31.566 --> 00:19:32.396 A:middle
What's inside the delegate?

00:19:32.496 --> 00:19:34.056 A:middle
Methods that relate
to WCSession.

00:19:34.596 --> 00:19:35.566 A:middle
You can see the pattern here.

00:19:36.076 --> 00:19:38.666 A:middle
Which we break with this one.

00:19:39.276 --> 00:19:42.966 A:middle
We have the app delegate
and of course it has methods

00:19:42.966 --> 00:19:44.606 A:middle
that relate to the
application object.

00:19:45.276 --> 00:19:48.636 A:middle
But then we stick other stuff
in there too like databases

00:19:48.636 --> 00:19:50.756 A:middle
and essentially eventually
you have everything

00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:53.036 A:middle
in there including the
kitchen sink just piling up.

00:19:53.326 --> 00:19:56.126 A:middle
And we do it because it's
really easy to reach back

00:19:56.506 --> 00:19:58.376 A:middle
through the Application
object, get the shared object,

00:19:58.376 --> 00:19:59.696 A:middle
cast it and retrieve it.

00:19:59.896 --> 00:20:03.416 A:middle
But it's such a strong coupling
between your view controllers

00:19:59.896 --> 00:20:03.416 A:middle
But it's such a strong coupling
between your view controllers

00:20:03.766 --> 00:20:06.396 A:middle
and your app delegate and your
app delegate doesn't really need

00:20:06.396 --> 00:20:07.716 A:middle
to be the place where that goes.

00:20:08.216 --> 00:20:11.666 A:middle
Instead of a pattern like this

00:20:11.956 --> 00:20:13.386 A:middle
where each view controller
reaches back

00:20:13.386 --> 00:20:15.206 A:middle
to some common object,
maybe that you're storing

00:20:15.206 --> 00:20:17.686 A:middle
in your app delegate,
you could switch it.

00:20:19.066 --> 00:20:21.866 A:middle
Using Dependency Injection,
you take the model object

00:20:22.116 --> 00:20:24.176 A:middle
that one view controller
has and you pass it forward

00:20:24.176 --> 00:20:25.626 A:middle
to the next view
controller at the time

00:20:25.626 --> 00:20:26.846 A:middle
that view controller
is presented.

00:20:27.486 --> 00:20:29.636 A:middle
The idea is you give the
view control everything

00:20:29.636 --> 00:20:31.706 A:middle
that it needs to do its job.

00:20:33.656 --> 00:20:36.326 A:middle
So, for mail, you'd have
a list of mailboxes.

00:20:36.896 --> 00:20:38.116 A:middle
A view controller
that shows a list

00:20:38.116 --> 00:20:40.496 A:middle
of mailboxes would have a model
object representing an array

00:20:40.496 --> 00:20:41.336 A:middle
of mailboxes.

00:20:41.726 --> 00:20:43.396 A:middle
You tap on one of the mailboxes.

00:20:43.846 --> 00:20:46.646 A:middle
Another view controller's
going to present

00:20:46.646 --> 00:20:48.176 A:middle
to show the messages
in that mailbox.

00:20:48.576 --> 00:20:49.186 A:middle
The middle one.

00:20:49.476 --> 00:20:51.866 A:middle
And you pass forward the one
mailbox and it shows those

00:20:51.866 --> 00:20:52.866 A:middle
and you keep passing it forward.

00:20:53.376 --> 00:20:58.576 A:middle
The way you would do that in
a segue is to override prepare

00:20:58.576 --> 00:20:59.936 A:middle
for segue and pass
it for repair.

00:21:00.496 --> 00:21:02.106 A:middle
The way you would do it

00:21:02.106 --> 00:21:04.736 A:middle
if you were programmatically
presenting is in the action

00:21:04.736 --> 00:21:06.506 A:middle
for the button viewed
in instantiate.

00:21:06.506 --> 00:21:08.816 A:middle
The view controller,
pass model object there.

00:21:10.416 --> 00:21:14.486 A:middle
The benefit of this technique
is your view controllers are

00:21:14.486 --> 00:21:15.636 A:middle
standalone now.

00:21:15.636 --> 00:21:17.756 A:middle
They don't have these strong
ties and dependencies.

00:21:17.956 --> 00:21:19.106 A:middle
You can reuse them more.

00:21:22.956 --> 00:21:24.796 A:middle
Coming back, you've
got some choices.

00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:27.876 A:middle
You can do what we do, which
is often to write a protocol

00:21:28.016 --> 00:21:30.276 A:middle
and have you implement it
so that there's a call back

00:21:30.276 --> 00:21:31.476 A:middle
to say the view controller's
dismissed

00:21:31.476 --> 00:21:32.846 A:middle
and maybe update
your model there.

00:21:32.986 --> 00:21:34.216 A:middle
You can pass in a closure.

00:21:34.726 --> 00:21:36.906 A:middle
You can pass object
models by reference.

00:21:37.266 --> 00:21:40.166 A:middle
Or, you can, if you're
using online segues,

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:42.376 A:middle
it's exactly the same as
overwriting prepare for segue

00:21:42.376 --> 00:21:43.866 A:middle
because it happens in both ways,

00:21:44.056 --> 00:21:45.496 A:middle
forward directions
and back directions.

00:21:46.926 --> 00:21:49.456 A:middle
Another reason why
we like this is

00:21:49.456 --> 00:21:51.926 A:middle
because view controllers are
pretty much like Lego blocks.

00:21:52.806 --> 00:21:55.416 A:middle
They should be able to be
rearranged independently

00:21:55.416 --> 00:21:57.366 A:middle
of each other to
create new structures.

00:21:57.716 --> 00:22:01.756 A:middle
In this case, an iPhone SE's
overall user experience is going

00:21:57.716 --> 00:22:01.756 A:middle
In this case, an iPhone SE's
overall user experience is going

00:22:01.756 --> 00:22:03.646 A:middle
to be different for your
app than it would be

00:22:03.646 --> 00:22:07.066 A:middle
on an iPad 12 inch,
iPadPro 12 inch.

00:22:08.056 --> 00:22:09.586 A:middle
If your view controllers
are independent,

00:22:09.586 --> 00:22:12.176 A:middle
it's easy to do that.

00:22:12.176 --> 00:22:12.486 A:middle
All right.

00:22:13.016 --> 00:22:17.196 A:middle
Now, last year at WWDC,
I gave a presentation

00:22:17.696 --> 00:22:22.366 A:middle
on topics including playgrounds
and modernizing the UI.

00:22:23.446 --> 00:22:26.356 A:middle
And interoperability with
Objective-C and Swift.

00:22:26.916 --> 00:22:31.286 A:middle
And since then, we've added
things to the playgrounds,

00:22:31.556 --> 00:22:32.816 A:middle
things that we couldn't
do last year.

00:22:32.816 --> 00:22:34.636 A:middle
So, I want to show you
some of those things.

00:22:35.306 --> 00:22:39.086 A:middle
With that, we're going
to move to a demo.

00:22:39.466 --> 00:22:42.346 A:middle
So, this is the periodic
table of elements app

00:22:42.346 --> 00:22:43.226 A:middle
that I showed you last year.

00:22:43.436 --> 00:22:45.296 A:middle
Since then, it's been
updated a little bit.

00:22:45.296 --> 00:22:49.126 A:middle
For example, the colors
have changed a bit.

00:22:49.266 --> 00:22:51.716 A:middle
Instead of using states
of matter, gas, liquid,

00:22:51.716 --> 00:22:55.096 A:middle
now it's the kind of object
like a transition metal, metal,

00:22:55.096 --> 00:22:57.366 A:middle
halogen, that kind of thing.

00:22:57.366 --> 00:22:58.946 A:middle
We've also added
support to render it

00:22:58.946 --> 00:23:01.756 A:middle
out so it actually looks like
a periodic table of elements

00:22:58.946 --> 00:23:01.756 A:middle
out so it actually looks like
a periodic table of elements

00:23:02.066 --> 00:23:04.066 A:middle
and that's a collection
view doing that.

00:23:05.996 --> 00:23:13.366 A:middle
I want to show you
some of the code.

00:23:13.576 --> 00:23:15.406 A:middle
One of the things that
changed with this code base

00:23:15.406 --> 00:23:17.586 A:middle
since the last time
that you saw it is

00:23:17.586 --> 00:23:19.726 A:middle
that the data model has
moved over to Swift.

00:23:20.686 --> 00:23:24.496 A:middle
So now I have a class the
represents an atomic element

00:23:24.796 --> 00:23:26.456 A:middle
like nitrogen or oxygen.

00:23:27.136 --> 00:23:29.716 A:middle
And I have a class that
represents a collection

00:23:30.196 --> 00:23:32.986 A:middle
of those called, excuse
me, periodic elements.

00:23:34.286 --> 00:23:37.386 A:middle
This class instantiates
the elements,

00:23:37.386 --> 00:23:40.566 A:middle
the individual atomic elements,
by reading in a property list.

00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:43.756 A:middle
Which I've also stored
in my app here.

00:23:44.326 --> 00:23:48.396 A:middle
But now that I've moved
the data model to Swift,

00:23:48.676 --> 00:23:50.526 A:middle
I can show you the data
model in a playground.

00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:53.256 A:middle
Last year when I did
this, I'm just going

00:23:53.256 --> 00:23:54.576 A:middle
to make a new playground first.

00:23:55.496 --> 00:23:56.666 A:middle
New file, playground.

00:23:57.226 --> 00:24:01.836 A:middle
Last year when I did
this, I was copying,

00:23:57.226 --> 00:24:01.836 A:middle
Last year when I did
this, I was copying,

00:24:01.836 --> 00:24:04.546 A:middle
pasting between my
code and my playground.

00:24:05.116 --> 00:24:08.916 A:middle
And when you do this a lot, your
playground can become really big

00:24:08.916 --> 00:24:09.906 A:middle
with a lot of code in it.

00:24:09.906 --> 00:24:13.076 A:middle
So, instead our playgrounds
now have subfolders

00:24:14.136 --> 00:24:15.756 A:middle
for source code and resources.

00:24:16.306 --> 00:24:20.926 A:middle
I can take my model
objects and put them

00:24:20.926 --> 00:24:21.936 A:middle
into the sources folder.

00:24:22.516 --> 00:24:26.126 A:middle
And then we compile
them behind the scenes

00:24:26.676 --> 00:24:29.316 A:middle
and we implicitly import
all of their public symbols

00:24:29.316 --> 00:24:31.816 A:middle
into the playground to make
them available for you.

00:24:33.476 --> 00:24:37.726 A:middle
Which means if I take this
resource file, my property list,

00:24:37.776 --> 00:24:39.586 A:middle
and include that in
the resources folder

00:24:39.836 --> 00:24:41.656 A:middle
which makes it accessible
to the playground,

00:24:42.256 --> 00:24:48.676 A:middle
I can come over to
the playground here

00:24:49.206 --> 00:24:51.746 A:middle
and instantiate an instance
of the atomic elements.

00:24:53.016 --> 00:24:53.966 A:middle
Here's Californium.

00:24:54.496 --> 00:24:57.166 A:middle
Like that.

00:24:58.346 --> 00:25:01.656 A:middle
So, the ability to
take these source files

00:24:58.346 --> 00:25:01.656 A:middle
So, the ability to
take these source files

00:25:02.016 --> 00:25:04.886 A:middle
and have them automatically
imported into your project

00:25:05.566 --> 00:25:07.006 A:middle
when they're in the
sources folder

00:25:07.006 --> 00:25:09.686 A:middle
or the resources folder is a
pretty, I think powerful way

00:25:10.116 --> 00:25:12.266 A:middle
to keep your playgrounds
themselves small

00:25:12.266 --> 00:25:16.586 A:middle
and concise while also having
more content inside of them.

00:25:16.796 --> 00:25:18.756 A:middle
Now, above and beyond that,
something else happened

00:25:18.756 --> 00:25:23.856 A:middle
since last year that affects
this app in particular.

00:25:24.236 --> 00:25:26.986 A:middle
The International Union of Pure

00:25:26.986 --> 00:25:30.996 A:middle
and Applied Chemistry
confirmed the discovery

00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:32.776 A:middle
of 4 additional elements.

00:25:33.666 --> 00:25:35.536 A:middle
So, now all of a sudden
this Property List file

00:25:35.536 --> 00:25:37.436 A:middle
that I've got embedded
inside my app doesn't seem

00:25:37.436 --> 00:25:38.766 A:middle
like such good idea anymore.

00:25:39.386 --> 00:25:42.686 A:middle
So, I thought well,
we can fix that.

00:25:42.686 --> 00:25:43.606 A:middle
We'll just put it online.

00:25:44.836 --> 00:25:48.676 A:middle
So I set up a little Web
server and put it a JSON file

00:25:48.676 --> 00:25:49.876 A:middle
at this time with
all the elements.

00:25:51.116 --> 00:25:53.676 A:middle
And then the idea is that
when my app launches,

00:25:54.196 --> 00:25:56.506 A:middle
initially it'll use the
embedded built-in data file.

00:25:57.176 --> 00:25:58.886 A:middle
That way if there's no
network connectivity,

00:25:58.886 --> 00:26:00.496 A:middle
there's still something
for the customer to see.

00:25:58.886 --> 00:26:00.496 A:middle
there's still something
for the customer to see.

00:26:00.496 --> 00:26:03.636 A:middle
And this is also a pattern
we recommend that you do.

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:06.226 A:middle
Then we'll do a background
check,

00:26:06.596 --> 00:26:07.866 A:middle
and in the background
we'll check to see

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:09.266 A:middle
if there's an update
to the file.

00:26:09.266 --> 00:26:10.836 A:middle
And if so, we'll put
it in the caches folder

00:26:10.836 --> 00:26:13.646 A:middle
and we'll reference
that inside the app.

00:26:14.436 --> 00:26:16.506 A:middle
So, I want to do the network
request in the playground.

00:26:17.126 --> 00:26:21.346 A:middle
And for that, we have the class
formerly known as NSURL Session

00:26:21.346 --> 00:26:23.136 A:middle
and now known as URL Session.

00:26:23.986 --> 00:26:26.276 A:middle
Which is shown here.

00:26:26.816 --> 00:26:32.286 A:middle
We grabbed the Session and the
thing I like about the Session

00:26:32.286 --> 00:26:35.066 A:middle
when I call it out on line 24,

00:26:36.256 --> 00:26:37.866 A:middle
is I give it a completion
handler.

00:26:38.596 --> 00:26:40.606 A:middle
Because this runs asynchronously
in the background.

00:26:41.356 --> 00:26:43.516 A:middle
Go to the Network Request,
let my code continue to run.

00:26:44.756 --> 00:26:48.926 A:middle
When the request either times
out or the data comes in,

00:26:48.926 --> 00:26:49.826 A:middle
it gives us call back.

00:26:49.826 --> 00:26:52.436 A:middle
And in the call back on line 28,

00:26:53.576 --> 00:26:55.916 A:middle
you can see I'm printing
out one element here.

00:26:56.476 --> 00:27:01.106 A:middle
But you actually don't
see it over there.

00:26:56.476 --> 00:27:01.106 A:middle
But you actually don't
see it over there.

00:27:02.286 --> 00:27:02.976 A:middle
That's a problem.

00:27:08.696 --> 00:27:10.266 A:middle
So, just think about
what's happening here.

00:27:10.886 --> 00:27:11.896 A:middle
We have a playground
that's running.

00:27:12.436 --> 00:27:14.076 A:middle
We asked it to do a
background operation.

00:27:14.736 --> 00:27:16.746 A:middle
At some indeterminate
time in the future,

00:27:17.246 --> 00:27:19.346 A:middle
we get a call back saying
this is what we want to do.

00:27:19.946 --> 00:27:22.136 A:middle
But playgrounds typically
execute like a script.

00:27:22.186 --> 00:27:23.406 A:middle
The first line all the way

00:27:23.406 --> 00:27:24.776 A:middle
through to the end
and they stop.

00:27:26.046 --> 00:27:27.076 A:middle
Key word being typically.

00:27:27.076 --> 00:27:28.296 A:middle
But they don't have to.

00:27:28.846 --> 00:27:31.476 A:middle
We can get a runloop and
have asynchronous operations

00:27:31.476 --> 00:27:32.266 A:middle
in our playgrounds.

00:27:33.246 --> 00:27:35.346 A:middle
To do that we import
a new module called

00:27:35.586 --> 00:27:36.236 A:middle
playground support.

00:27:37.346 --> 00:27:42.766 A:middle
And then you ask the playground
for indefinite execution.

00:27:42.766 --> 00:27:45.826 A:middle
And then it never stops,
it just keeps processing.

00:27:46.406 --> 00:27:49.656 A:middle
So, now if I scroll
down to this section,

00:27:49.656 --> 00:27:52.436 A:middle
you can see I'm getting
my callback.

00:27:53.126 --> 00:27:53.786 A:middle
There's cadmium.

00:27:53.876 --> 00:27:54.426 A:middle
All right.

00:27:56.996 --> 00:28:02.356 A:middle
Next I want to expand
on last year.

00:27:56.996 --> 00:28:02.356 A:middle
Next I want to expand
on last year.

00:28:02.446 --> 00:28:04.566 A:middle
Last I showed a drawing,

00:28:04.566 --> 00:28:07.786 A:middle
a rounded corner
core graphics image.

00:28:08.896 --> 00:28:10.706 A:middle
This time I don't just want to
draw an image and preview it.

00:28:10.706 --> 00:28:13.206 A:middle
I want to do a whole table view
controller in the playground.

00:28:13.676 --> 00:28:17.416 A:middle
And we have some new features

00:28:17.416 --> 00:28:19.096 A:middle
in the playgrounds
that let us do this.

00:28:19.826 --> 00:28:24.366 A:middle
Let me just open up
some space in my app.

00:28:25.016 --> 00:28:27.656 A:middle
Call it View.

00:28:28.216 --> 00:28:33.336 A:middle
So, I'm going to make a subclass
of UI Table View Controller.

00:28:34.916 --> 00:28:40.756 A:middle
This is all that it
is, a selected area.

00:28:41.036 --> 00:28:43.016 A:middle
I'm implementing the 2
methods at every Table View

00:28:43.016 --> 00:28:44.836 A:middle
or Table View Controller
are required to have.

00:28:45.236 --> 00:28:48.966 A:middle
Number of objects, sorry,
rather number of items,

00:28:49.226 --> 00:28:51.906 A:middle
self-wrote index that and
returnings themselves.

00:28:52.446 --> 00:28:55.076 A:middle
And I'd like to see that live.

00:28:56.286 --> 00:28:59.616 A:middle
So, this time what we do is we
instantiate the view controller

00:29:00.556 --> 00:29:02.826 A:middle
and then using that
playground support module

00:29:02.996 --> 00:29:06.036 A:middle
that I've already imported, the
one that's right here on line 4,

00:29:06.576 --> 00:29:11.346 A:middle
I grab the playground's
Live View.

00:29:11.946 --> 00:29:16.886 A:middle
And then we take that
view and we render it

00:29:16.886 --> 00:29:19.736 A:middle
into the assistant editor who's
no longer an Assistant Editor

00:29:20.776 --> 00:29:22.156 A:middle
but rather our Live View.

00:29:29.366 --> 00:29:31.006 A:middle
See? It's a Live Table View.

00:29:31.466 --> 00:29:32.856 A:middle
It scrolls, it's active.

00:29:34.466 --> 00:29:36.466 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:37.206 A:middle
Thank you.

00:29:37.496 --> 00:29:38.746 A:middle
Is not just a static image.

00:29:39.226 --> 00:29:40.366 A:middle
It's a real interactive
table view.

00:29:40.366 --> 00:29:42.876 A:middle
If you wanted to try some
of our new delegate methods

00:29:42.876 --> 00:29:44.766 A:middle
or even the existent delegate
methods, you could throw them

00:29:44.766 --> 00:29:46.286 A:middle
into the playground and
now interact with them.

00:29:46.786 --> 00:29:50.406 A:middle
No need to put this into
the simulator anymore.

00:29:51.666 --> 00:29:53.396 A:middle
So, now I want to take the two
things and put them together.

00:29:54.536 --> 00:29:56.956 A:middle
Specifically, I have this
background network request

00:29:56.956 --> 00:29:57.576 A:middle
that's happening.

00:29:57.976 --> 00:30:00.546 A:middle
And after I retrieve the data,
I want to reload my table view.

00:29:57.976 --> 00:30:00.546 A:middle
And after I retrieve the data,
I want to reload my table view.

00:30:00.736 --> 00:30:09.126 A:middle
So, let me show you that.

00:30:09.326 --> 00:30:11.316 A:middle
First of all, comment this.

00:30:12.106 --> 00:30:15.316 A:middle
And just to prove to you that
it's totally loading the data

00:30:15.316 --> 00:30:19.136 A:middle
from that site, I'm
going to change this

00:30:19.226 --> 00:30:21.746 A:middle
so I have an empty
array of elements.

00:30:21.746 --> 00:30:22.446 A:middle
All right.

00:30:26.496 --> 00:30:28.846 A:middle
So, I have an empty
array of elements.

00:30:28.846 --> 00:30:30.006 A:middle
I do the network request.

00:30:30.766 --> 00:30:32.086 A:middle
When the network
request comes back

00:30:32.086 --> 00:30:34.936 A:middle
and it's call back, it's a sign.

00:30:35.496 --> 00:30:37.886 A:middle
The new array of elements
that I just pulled in.

00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:39.446 A:middle
And then we reload
the Table View.

00:30:40.036 --> 00:30:41.856 A:middle
All right.

00:30:51.056 --> 00:30:51.786 A:middle
Is that what you would expect?

00:30:51.786 --> 00:30:54.456 A:middle
It's not what I expected the
first time that I saw that.

00:30:54.966 --> 00:30:56.186 A:middle
Oh, that must be a bug in Xcode.

00:30:56.186 --> 00:30:58.006 A:middle
I'll just go file a bug
report at Apple.com.

00:30:58.566 --> 00:30:59.426 A:middle
But it's actually not.

00:31:00.916 --> 00:31:03.116 A:middle
It's a bug in my code,
believe it or not.

00:31:03.356 --> 00:31:05.926 A:middle
It's a bug in my code and
here's what's happening.

00:31:06.916 --> 00:31:09.636 A:middle
We have this background
operation coming in.

00:31:10.456 --> 00:31:12.446 A:middle
The background operation
has a background operation.

00:31:12.696 --> 00:31:13.506 A:middle
It's not on the main thread.

00:31:14.176 --> 00:31:15.166 A:middle
UI is in the main thread.

00:31:16.026 --> 00:31:19.856 A:middle
So, in my closure, the
completion handler,

00:31:19.856 --> 00:31:21.646 A:middle
I can't be updating the
main thread from there,

00:31:22.066 --> 00:31:25.136 A:middle
which is what I'm trying to do
when I reload my Table View.

00:31:26.476 --> 00:31:31.066 A:middle
When I tap on the cells,
we are invalidating them

00:31:31.066 --> 00:31:32.196 A:middle
and that's why they do refresh

00:31:32.196 --> 00:31:36.026 A:middle
and you can see them
at that time.

00:31:36.226 --> 00:31:37.406 A:middle
This is also something
we can fix.

00:31:37.406 --> 00:31:40.246 A:middle
We have something new in
Swift 3, which is a Swift API

00:31:40.526 --> 00:31:42.036 A:middle
for Grand Central Dispatch.

00:31:43.856 --> 00:31:47.746 A:middle
So, instead of that
C API we had before,

00:31:47.746 --> 00:31:53.196 A:middle
I can now say a dispatch
cue, which cues the main cue.

00:31:53.476 --> 00:31:54.306 A:middle
What kind of operation?

00:31:54.306 --> 00:31:55.226 A:middle
An asynchronous one.

00:31:55.656 --> 00:31:56.486 A:middle
We don't need that anymore.

00:31:57.126 --> 00:31:58.706 A:middle
And here's what I wanted
to do on the main thread.

00:31:58.706 --> 00:32:04.106 A:middle
Now it bounces back to the
main thread and it's there.

00:31:58.706 --> 00:32:04.106 A:middle
Now it bounces back to the
main thread and it's there.

00:32:06.616 --> 00:32:11.006 A:middle
Dispatch cue, thank you,
dispatch cue in Swift,

00:32:11.606 --> 00:32:14.426 A:middle
Live Views in Swift and
indefinite execution.

00:32:15.776 --> 00:32:17.666 A:middle
Let's switch back to the slides.

00:32:18.506 --> 00:32:20.506 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:20.996 --> 00:32:21.376 A:middle
Thank you.

00:32:21.676 --> 00:32:24.476 A:middle
So, just as a point of
summary, there's the key points

00:32:24.476 --> 00:32:26.996 A:middle
from the previous presentation,
or the preset demonstration.

00:32:27.526 --> 00:32:30.196 A:middle
Some other tips.

00:32:30.676 --> 00:32:32.806 A:middle
When I dragged those files
into the sources folder

00:32:32.806 --> 00:32:34.496 A:middle
or the resources
folder, they are copied.

00:32:34.536 --> 00:32:37.106 A:middle
They are not referenced.

00:32:37.106 --> 00:32:40.686 A:middle
Also, only methods that are
marked as public, methods,

00:32:40.686 --> 00:32:42.246 A:middle
properties, and datatypes,
etc that are marked

00:32:42.246 --> 00:32:43.696 A:middle
as public are going
to be available

00:32:43.966 --> 00:32:44.906 A:middle
to you in the playground.

00:32:44.906 --> 00:32:46.796 A:middle
So, you might have to go
add some public specifiers

00:32:46.796 --> 00:32:48.646 A:middle
because the default
visibility specifier

00:32:48.646 --> 00:32:50.636 A:middle
in Swift is internal,
not public.

00:32:53.196 --> 00:32:55.516 A:middle
I mentioned using
a caches folder.

00:32:56.566 --> 00:32:58.746 A:middle
Now, we still have
some devices out there

00:32:58.746 --> 00:33:00.976 A:middle
that are constrained
storage wise.

00:32:58.746 --> 00:33:00.976 A:middle
that are constrained
storage wise.

00:33:01.586 --> 00:33:03.636 A:middle
And those customers try
to updates to new versions

00:33:03.636 --> 00:33:05.046 A:middle
of the operating
system and they find

00:33:05.046 --> 00:33:06.156 A:middle
out there's not enough space.

00:33:07.046 --> 00:33:08.806 A:middle
So, what we do when that
happens, when the device is

00:33:08.806 --> 00:33:11.516 A:middle
under storage pressure, is we
go through the caches folders

00:33:11.516 --> 00:33:12.806 A:middle
and we delete everything
we can find

00:33:12.806 --> 00:33:14.356 A:middle
in all the applications
caches folders.

00:33:14.626 --> 00:33:15.896 A:middle
This way we free up space.

00:33:16.966 --> 00:33:18.256 A:middle
We need your help with this.

00:33:18.386 --> 00:33:20.306 A:middle
If you are temporarily
downloading data

00:33:20.306 --> 00:33:22.276 A:middle
and you're not putting
into caches folder,

00:33:22.586 --> 00:33:23.696 A:middle
put it in the caches folder.

00:33:24.176 --> 00:33:29.656 A:middle
Next. I thought it'd
be really neat to take,

00:33:30.316 --> 00:33:33.756 A:middle
it's doing that again.

00:33:34.396 --> 00:33:39.266 A:middle
To take the view controllers
that use dependency injection

00:33:39.266 --> 00:33:42.466 A:middle
and rearrange them in a way that
might suit a different platform.

00:33:43.076 --> 00:33:45.626 A:middle
So, I'm going switch
back to the demo.

00:33:48.216 --> 00:33:49.456 A:middle
Turn on my Bluetooth.

00:33:55.316 --> 00:33:58.796 A:middle
And take the view controllers
as is over the tvOS.

00:34:14.576 --> 00:34:15.806 A:middle
Well, there we go.

00:34:15.876 --> 00:34:21.786 A:middle
I have paired my
Siri remote to my Mac

00:34:21.786 --> 00:34:23.206 A:middle
so I can use it with
the simulator.

00:34:24.735 --> 00:34:27.186 A:middle
It's exactly the same code
from before, same view,

00:34:27.186 --> 00:34:30.726 A:middle
same table view, all
that stuff is there.

00:34:30.936 --> 00:34:35.206 A:middle
I can go over and I can see
the periodic table like this.

00:34:35.446 --> 00:34:37.956 A:middle
And I get that neat TV effect
when I slide over the cells

00:34:37.956 --> 00:34:38.766 A:middle
and its collection view.

00:34:39.255 --> 00:34:40.416 A:middle
It's the same layout code.

00:34:40.416 --> 00:34:41.476 A:middle
It's the same view controller.

00:34:41.476 --> 00:34:43.186 A:middle
It's all the same as
what I had before.

00:34:44.626 --> 00:34:47.085 A:middle
Well, almost.

00:34:55.896 --> 00:34:57.436 A:middle
I added this line
of code so that

00:34:57.436 --> 00:34:59.676 A:middle
when I selected a
collection view cell,

00:34:59.676 --> 00:35:01.916 A:middle
you would get that focused item.

00:34:59.676 --> 00:35:01.916 A:middle
you would get that focused item.

00:35:02.636 --> 00:35:05.786 A:middle
And I used the OS
Compiler directive

00:35:06.126 --> 00:35:07.526 A:middle
to say this is only for tvOS.

00:35:08.326 --> 00:35:09.346 A:middle
Other than that,
it's the same code.

00:35:10.216 --> 00:35:11.536 A:middle
Which kind of brings
me to another point

00:35:11.536 --> 00:35:14.886 A:middle
that if you ever think you are
taking an app from one platform

00:35:14.886 --> 00:35:16.396 A:middle
and just dropping it
on another platform

00:35:16.846 --> 00:35:18.476 A:middle
with no real other changes,

00:35:18.476 --> 00:35:21.446 A:middle
you're possibly doing something
wrong and might want to check

00:35:21.446 --> 00:35:23.146 A:middle
out the human interface
guidelines just

00:35:23.146 --> 00:35:25.386 A:middle
to see how you can make
that platform and that app

00:35:25.386 --> 00:35:30.596 A:middle
on that platform more native and
feel more like it belongs there.

00:35:31.226 --> 00:35:34.476 A:middle
Let me give you an example.

00:35:34.476 --> 00:35:36.706 A:middle
Let's say that you made
an app that does some sort

00:35:36.706 --> 00:35:37.936 A:middle
of like cloud-based accounting.

00:35:38.686 --> 00:35:41.656 A:middle
And maybe you have an iPad
version and on the iPad version,

00:35:41.656 --> 00:35:42.746 A:middle
people fill out invoices.

00:35:43.476 --> 00:35:44.646 A:middle
Makes sense.

00:35:45.596 --> 00:35:48.496 A:middle
It makes no sense,
in my opinion,

00:35:49.376 --> 00:35:52.286 A:middle
to fill out invoices
on a 60-inch TV.

00:35:52.286 --> 00:35:53.686 A:middle
You just wouldn't do it.

00:35:53.686 --> 00:35:54.316 A:middle
Why would you do that?

00:35:54.916 --> 00:35:56.746 A:middle
This is not an app you
would just take as is

00:35:56.746 --> 00:35:58.606 A:middle
and launch it on tvOS.

00:35:59.216 --> 00:36:02.576 A:middle
But, the iPad version of your
app probably has some great

00:35:59.216 --> 00:36:02.576 A:middle
But, the iPad version of your
app probably has some great

00:36:02.576 --> 00:36:04.586 A:middle
visualization about how
the company is performing.

00:36:04.586 --> 00:36:06.186 A:middle
Maybe you've got some
graphs or charts.

00:36:07.446 --> 00:36:08.716 A:middle
Those would be awesome on a TV.

00:36:09.006 --> 00:36:13.806 A:middle
You could have a version of your
app that has a Live Status board

00:36:13.806 --> 00:36:14.816 A:middle
of how the company's doing.

00:36:15.236 --> 00:36:17.646 A:middle
And maybe in the company's
boardroom or something it's just

00:36:17.646 --> 00:36:19.596 A:middle
on and it just animates
through and shows an update.

00:36:19.756 --> 00:36:20.936 A:middle
It's the same data model.

00:36:21.046 --> 00:36:22.356 A:middle
It's the same data access.

00:36:22.856 --> 00:36:24.536 A:middle
But you pivoted that
data in a way

00:36:24.536 --> 00:36:26.786 A:middle
that makes it more
applicable for the platform

00:36:26.786 --> 00:36:27.466 A:middle
in which it's running.

00:36:27.626 --> 00:36:29.166 A:middle
And that's an idea I
want you to think about.

00:36:29.166 --> 00:36:31.176 A:middle
How can we take the same data
that we have and just pivot it

00:36:31.396 --> 00:36:36.536 A:middle
in a way that works
for that platform?

00:36:36.536 --> 00:36:40.536 A:middle
In summary, modernizing your
app is an ongoing process.

00:36:40.536 --> 00:36:42.776 A:middle
We want you to rely on the
frameworks as much as you can.

00:36:44.086 --> 00:36:46.216 A:middle
If you can get rid of
code that's in your app

00:36:46.216 --> 00:36:48.306 A:middle
and instead use code that
we've got in our frameworks,

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:49.676 A:middle
that's code let's code
for you to maintain.

00:36:50.406 --> 00:36:51.096 A:middle
We'd like you to do that.

00:36:52.096 --> 00:36:54.726 A:middle
We want you to get started today
with finding issues with Xcode,

00:36:54.726 --> 00:36:56.036 A:middle
with the Swift converter.

00:36:56.036 --> 00:36:58.496 A:middle
We want you to architect
your app

00:36:58.496 --> 00:37:00.706 A:middle
with fewer inter-object
dependencies so it's easier

00:36:58.496 --> 00:37:00.706 A:middle
with fewer inter-object
dependencies so it's easier

00:37:00.706 --> 00:37:03.146 A:middle
for you to rearrange your app.

00:37:04.436 --> 00:37:07.166 A:middle
Finally, we want you to
consider bringing your app

00:37:07.166 --> 00:37:09.626 A:middle
to other platforms
of ours [laughter]

00:37:14.366 --> 00:37:15.336 A:middle
by pivoting your data model.

00:37:16.136 --> 00:37:18.146 A:middle
There are some related
sessions you can check out.

00:37:18.776 --> 00:37:19.356 A:middle
There you go.

00:37:20.126 --> 00:37:25.356 A:middle
And other than that, you
can check out our link

00:37:25.356 --> 00:37:26.456 A:middle
for this particular session.

00:37:26.716 --> 00:37:27.926 A:middle
And that is it for me.

00:37:28.186 --> 00:37:28.796 A:middle
Thanks, everyone.

00:37:29.516 --> 00:37:33.500 A:middle
