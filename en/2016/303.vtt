[ Music ]

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:24.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:27.126 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:28.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Welcome to Session 303.

00:00:29.126 --> 00:00:30.116 A:middle
I'm Todd Fernandez.

00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:32.146 A:middle
And I'm very pleased to be
here with you this morning

00:00:32.146 --> 00:00:35.316 A:middle
to give you an update on what's
new in managing Apple devices.

00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:38.566 A:middle
Now, before we begin,
I do have to warn you

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.286 A:middle
that I am still a
little bit tired

00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:42.406 A:middle
after attending my college
reunion last weekend.

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:44.676 A:middle
And I'm not going to
tell you which one,

00:00:44.676 --> 00:00:46.386 A:middle
but if it had been
an anniversary,

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:47.636 A:middle
I would have received
some silver.

00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:51.616 A:middle
Now, despite being a little
tired, I'm very grateful

00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:54.336 A:middle
to see you all here in the hall,
but I also want to give a shout

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:56.696 A:middle
out to all of you watching the
live stream around the world,

00:00:57.286 --> 00:01:00.046 A:middle
as well as you future viewers
watching this recording

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:57.286 --> 00:01:00.046 A:middle
as well as you future viewers
watching this recording

00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:03.306 A:middle
at some indefinite period
like some three-eyed raven.

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:04.956 A:middle
Hello, future viewers.

00:01:07.826 --> 00:01:10.236 A:middle
But speaking of the
passage of time --

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:12.926 A:middle
no, not that kind of time,

00:01:12.926 --> 00:01:14.366 A:middle
although I do love
my Apple Watch --

00:01:14.986 --> 00:01:16.256 A:middle
I want to talk about
the calendar.

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:21.406 A:middle
Now, many of you here in the
hall today the spring may seem

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:23.446 A:middle
like a quiet time for
device management.

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:27.216 A:middle
As we toil behind the scenes
on all the new capabilities

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:31.326 A:middle
that we're going to
announce and preview at WWDC

00:01:31.416 --> 00:01:33.406 A:middle
and then ship in
our fall releases.

00:01:34.416 --> 00:01:36.696 A:middle
But it turns out
surprisingly enough

00:01:37.136 --> 00:01:38.276 A:middle
that schools actually want

00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:40.986 A:middle
to use those features
before we typically ship our

00:01:40.986 --> 00:01:41.816 A:middle
fall releases.

00:01:42.606 --> 00:01:44.626 A:middle
They want to configure
devices taking advantage

00:01:44.626 --> 00:01:46.886 A:middle
of all those new
features over the summer

00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:48.916 A:middle
for use during the
next school year.

00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:51.036 A:middle
But in order to do that,

00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:53.836 A:middle
they need to have already
purchased their hardware

00:01:53.836 --> 00:01:55.436 A:middle
and software even earlier.

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:59.436 A:middle
And in order to do that, they
need to have evaluated all

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:02.786 A:middle
of the new hardware, software,
and tools options even earlier.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:02.786 A:middle
of the new hardware, software,
and tools options even earlier.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.856 A:middle
Which brings us to iOS 9.3.

00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:08.466 A:middle
It's really strange how
that release date just kind

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.526 A:middle
of jumped right out at us.

00:02:11.186 --> 00:02:12.996 A:middle
But the schedule isn't
the interesting part;

00:02:12.996 --> 00:02:14.176 A:middle
what about the features?

00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:17.226 A:middle
There are a ton of new
features that we released

00:02:17.406 --> 00:02:19.866 A:middle
in our spring software
and service releases.

00:02:20.326 --> 00:02:22.726 A:middle
But the true stars of the
show are clearly Apple School

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:25.476 A:middle
Manager, Shared iPad,
and Classroom.

00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:29.076 A:middle
Let's first talk a little bit
about Apple School Manager,

00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:32.126 A:middle
which provides a
streamlined enrollment process

00:02:32.126 --> 00:02:34.516 A:middle
to access Apple's device
management services.

00:02:35.606 --> 00:02:38.796 A:middle
Those services include
creating accounts for students

00:02:38.796 --> 00:02:40.986 A:middle
and teachers, as well as
the class relationships

00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:44.796 A:middle
between them, configuring how
their devices will be enrolled

00:02:44.796 --> 00:02:48.296 A:middle
for remote management, and
purchasing the apps and books

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:50.856 A:middle
and creating the curriculum
that will help students learn.

00:02:52.356 --> 00:02:55.636 A:middle
And fortunately, one of the
technology directors at one

00:02:55.636 --> 00:02:56.396 A:middle
of the school districts

00:02:56.396 --> 00:02:59.496 A:middle
which piloted these features
earlier this year agrees

00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:02.206 A:middle
that Apple School Manager will
save their tech staff lots


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:02.206 A:middle
that Apple School Manager will
save their tech staff lots

00:03:02.206 --> 00:03:05.366 A:middle
of time, allowing them to
manage devices, content,

00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:07.286 A:middle
and our student accounts
all from one place,

00:03:07.636 --> 00:03:08.866 A:middle
exactly what we intended.

00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:11.556 A:middle
Now let's turn to Shared iPad.

00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:16.386 A:middle
Shared iPad allows the majority
of schools in the United States

00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:18.736 A:middle
and around the world
which share devices

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:22.286 A:middle
to provide their students
with a personalized experience

00:03:22.496 --> 00:03:25.396 A:middle
and enable them to use the
complete Apple ecosystem.

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:30.216 A:middle
Shared iPad can be configured so
that younger students can sign

00:03:30.216 --> 00:03:32.176 A:middle
in by simply tapping
on their photo

00:03:32.896 --> 00:03:34.806 A:middle
and entering a four-digit
pass code.

00:03:36.036 --> 00:03:38.996 A:middle
Student data is stored in
the Cloud and downloaded

00:03:38.996 --> 00:03:42.466 A:middle
to a specific iPad when
they sign in as needed.

00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:47.676 A:middle
Again, it's great to see that
the folks who are responsible

00:03:47.676 --> 00:03:51.016 A:middle
for getting these Shared iPads
into the students' hands agree

00:03:51.016 --> 00:03:54.326 A:middle
that Shared iPad will allow our
district to transform a cart

00:03:54.326 --> 00:03:55.156 A:middle
of shared devices

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:57.846 A:middle
into a personalized learning
experience for each student.

00:03:58.226 --> 00:03:59.316 A:middle
Again, nailed it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:00.856 A:middle
All right.

00:04:01.086 --> 00:04:02.456 A:middle
Finally, Classroom.

00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:06.286 A:middle
Classroom empowers
teachers to keep themselves

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:08.456 A:middle
and their students
focused on learning,

00:04:08.776 --> 00:04:12.256 A:middle
rather than managing technology
by placing a small set

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:15.366 A:middle
of key capabilities at
their fingertips right

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:16.166 A:middle
in the classroom.

00:04:17.516 --> 00:04:22.076 A:middle
Teachers can easily open an app
or a chapter in an iBook on all

00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:26.076 A:middle
or a selected group of student
devices, project student work

00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:31.256 A:middle
to the Classroom Apple TV, or
monitor and redirect a student

00:04:31.256 --> 00:04:33.406 A:middle
who may be off task even
while they're working

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:35.766 A:middle
with a different group of
students across the classroom.

00:04:35.946 --> 00:04:39.006 A:middle
And I was very fortunate

00:04:39.006 --> 00:04:41.426 A:middle
to visit Mr. Garcia's
classroom a few months ago,

00:04:41.556 --> 00:04:43.956 A:middle
and it was truly inspiring
to see the projects

00:04:43.956 --> 00:04:46.326 A:middle
that his students were
working on their Shared iPads

00:04:46.596 --> 00:04:48.306 A:middle
with his support
using Classroom.

00:04:48.926 --> 00:04:51.476 A:middle
And after his experience
he reports

00:04:51.476 --> 00:04:53.776 A:middle
that Classroom has been an
extremely useful tool throughout

00:04:53.776 --> 00:04:56.646 A:middle
the school day to enhance the
project-based learning that's

00:04:56.646 --> 00:04:57.886 A:middle
going on his classroom.

00:04:58.476 --> 00:05:00.646 A:middle
Classroom helps him to keep
all of his students accountable


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:58.476 --> 00:05:00.646 A:middle
Classroom helps him to keep
all of his students accountable

00:05:00.646 --> 00:05:03.616 A:middle
for their work while also
keeping them extremely engaged

00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:04.566 A:middle
in their assignments.

00:05:05.626 --> 00:05:07.836 A:middle
Now while it's extremely
gratifying to get this kind

00:05:07.836 --> 00:05:11.146 A:middle
of response to the features we
released, it's also been great

00:05:11.146 --> 00:05:13.916 A:middle
to hear some great feedback
about their quality,

00:05:14.416 --> 00:05:17.336 A:middle
including from some very
difficult to impress customers

00:05:17.806 --> 00:05:21.336 A:middle
who have raved about the blazing
performance and reliability

00:05:21.336 --> 00:05:22.536 A:middle
of Classroom's features.

00:05:22.846 --> 00:05:26.836 A:middle
Now, these spring 2016 changes

00:05:27.006 --> 00:05:29.056 A:middle
with an extremely
well-received feature set

00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:31.556 A:middle
and high quality
delivered on a schedule

00:05:31.556 --> 00:05:34.596 A:middle
which schools need
underline Apple's commitment

00:05:34.896 --> 00:05:37.116 A:middle
to deliver not only
the best devices

00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:39.026 A:middle
and most advanced
operating systems

00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:41.736 A:middle
but also the best device
management experience.

00:05:43.056 --> 00:05:46.056 A:middle
We've demonstrated this
commitment by investing heavily

00:05:46.186 --> 00:05:47.566 A:middle
in providing a great experience

00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:50.156 A:middle
to schools bringing Apple
devices into their classrooms.

00:05:50.826 --> 00:05:53.536 A:middle
But we need all of our
partners, from NDM vendors

00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:56.616 A:middle
to tool providers, to all of you
app developers who would love

00:05:56.616 --> 00:05:59.016 A:middle
to see your app used by
thousands of students

00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:02.216 A:middle
around the world to
join with us to ensure

around the world to
join with us to ensure

00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:04.056 A:middle
that that great experience
reaches all

00:06:04.056 --> 00:06:06.436 A:middle
of our joint customers
all over the world.

00:06:07.616 --> 00:06:09.816 A:middle
But I do want to
encourage to you keep

00:06:09.816 --> 00:06:12.456 A:middle
up because although we don't
talk about future products,

00:06:12.656 --> 00:06:13.906 A:middle
we are definitely not done yet.

00:06:14.116 --> 00:06:18.966 A:middle
So today I'm going to cover
all of the new developments

00:06:18.966 --> 00:06:21.046 A:middle
across the entire device
management life cycle.

00:06:21.436 --> 00:06:22.686 A:middle
So let's go ahead
and get started.

00:06:22.686 --> 00:06:28.146 A:middle
I'll cover a few changes to
some existing features and go

00:06:28.146 --> 00:06:30.096 A:middle
into some detail
about the new things

00:06:30.096 --> 00:06:32.236 A:middle
like Apple School Manager,
Managed Apple IDs, and,

00:06:32.496 --> 00:06:33.666 A:middle
of course, Shared iPad.

00:06:36.376 --> 00:06:39.356 A:middle
So first I want to cover a few
things that haven't changed.

00:06:39.516 --> 00:06:42.346 A:middle
For Enterprise customers we
still have the Apple deployment

00:06:42.346 --> 00:06:44.326 A:middle
programs, the Device
Enrollment Program

00:06:44.326 --> 00:06:47.366 A:middle
for configuring how your devices
enroll for remote management,

00:06:47.906 --> 00:06:50.856 A:middle
as well as the volume purchase
program for purchasing your apps

00:06:50.856 --> 00:06:53.706 A:middle
and books and distributing them
to your devices and your users.

00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:56.546 A:middle
However, we've also
added a number

00:06:56.546 --> 00:06:59.056 A:middle
of new device management
commands and settings

00:06:59.176 --> 00:07:01.476 A:middle
in the spring and
that I'm going to talk


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.176 --> 00:07:01.476 A:middle
in the spring and
that I'm going to talk

00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:02.606 A:middle
about later in this session.

00:07:02.606 --> 00:07:05.736 A:middle
And we'll try to highlight those
that are specific interests

00:07:05.736 --> 00:07:08.516 A:middle
to Enterprise customers, though
many of the things we've done

00:07:08.516 --> 00:07:11.226 A:middle
for education also are
useful in Enterprise.

00:07:12.646 --> 00:07:15.026 A:middle
Turning to education,
now let's talk

00:07:15.026 --> 00:07:16.986 A:middle
about Apple School
Manager in more detail.

00:07:17.796 --> 00:07:21.056 A:middle
As I mentioned, it allows the
school to manage the people,

00:07:21.276 --> 00:07:25.426 A:middle
the devices, and the content the
school is managing to deliver

00:07:25.426 --> 00:07:27.566 A:middle
that improved performance
in the classroom.

00:07:29.936 --> 00:07:32.196 A:middle
With respect to getting
those accounts created,

00:07:32.196 --> 00:07:35.666 A:middle
there are two options: You can
connect Apple School Manager

00:07:35.716 --> 00:07:38.676 A:middle
to your student information
system to pull

00:07:38.676 --> 00:07:41.136 A:middle
out all the student,
teacher, and staff,

00:07:41.136 --> 00:07:44.686 A:middle
and relationship information;
alternatively, you can upload

00:07:44.686 --> 00:07:47.246 A:middle
that information
using a CSV template.

00:07:47.646 --> 00:07:51.006 A:middle
Once Apple School Manager
has that information,

00:07:51.696 --> 00:07:54.926 A:middle
it creates managed Apple IDs
for each student and teacher,

00:07:55.566 --> 00:07:59.786 A:middle
as well as creating classes
that have those relationships

00:07:59.786 --> 00:08:02.516 A:middle
between which teachers have
which students in their classes.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.786 --> 00:08:02.516 A:middle
between which teachers have
which students in their classes.

00:08:05.826 --> 00:08:07.626 A:middle
What are those managed
Apple IDs?

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:10.246 A:middle
Well, they're used both
by the school staff

00:08:10.596 --> 00:08:12.026 A:middle
as administer accounts

00:08:12.286 --> 00:08:14.646 A:middle
and accommodate tiered
administration

00:08:14.646 --> 00:08:17.486 A:middle
so that different administers
can have different privileges

00:08:17.486 --> 00:08:20.176 A:middle
for managing your school's
people, content, and devices.

00:08:21.416 --> 00:08:24.676 A:middle
The student accounts have a
few special characteristics.

00:08:25.566 --> 00:08:28.206 A:middle
They're required to
sign into a Shared iPad,

00:08:28.856 --> 00:08:31.456 A:middle
but they can be used for
one-to-one deployments as well.

00:08:32.306 --> 00:08:35.346 A:middle
And in Apple School Manager
you can configure the pass code

00:08:35.346 --> 00:08:37.006 A:middle
options for Managed Apple ID

00:08:37.306 --> 00:08:40.905 A:middle
from the full-strength iCloud
password to a simpler four

00:08:40.905 --> 00:08:43.586 A:middle
or six-digit pass code.

00:08:43.775 --> 00:08:45.786 A:middle
Managed Apple IDs are
special in another way

00:08:45.886 --> 00:08:49.176 A:middle
in that some services are
disabled, such as commerce,

00:08:49.256 --> 00:08:52.326 A:middle
so that students using a Managed
Apple ID cannot purchase things

00:08:52.326 --> 00:08:53.156 A:middle
from our stores.

00:08:53.936 --> 00:08:56.796 A:middle
There are also services such
as FaceTime and iMessage

00:08:56.956 --> 00:08:58.116 A:middle
which can be enabled

00:08:58.116 --> 00:09:02.216 A:middle
if the school decides they
would like to use them.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.116 --> 00:09:02.216 A:middle
if the school decides they
would like to use them.

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:02.756 A:middle
All right.

00:09:02.756 --> 00:09:05.346 A:middle
For you NDM vendors
out there, of course,

00:09:05.346 --> 00:09:07.596 A:middle
just as with the Device
Enrollment Program

00:09:07.596 --> 00:09:09.996 A:middle
and the volume purchase
program, there's an API

00:09:10.566 --> 00:09:12.386 A:middle
to access this roster
information

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:16.076 A:middle
from Apple School Manager and
give your NDM solution access

00:09:16.076 --> 00:09:18.666 A:middle
to all the student and
teacher Managed Apple IDs,

00:09:19.046 --> 00:09:20.206 A:middle
as well as the classes.

00:09:22.626 --> 00:09:25.106 A:middle
In terms of the transition
from schools moving

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:26.996 A:middle
from the Apple deployment
programs

00:09:26.996 --> 00:09:29.786 A:middle
to Apple School Manager,
the good news for them is

00:09:29.786 --> 00:09:32.036 A:middle
that they do not need
to download new tokens.

00:09:32.036 --> 00:09:33.586 A:middle
It will continue to work.

00:09:34.386 --> 00:09:37.686 A:middle
But your NDM solution needs to
be ready for this transition

00:09:38.426 --> 00:09:42.446 A:middle
and be checking to see if their
token is now an Apple School

00:09:42.446 --> 00:09:45.356 A:middle
Manager type and
supports the new v3 API,

00:09:45.946 --> 00:09:48.216 A:middle
which will actually be
what gives you access

00:09:48.216 --> 00:09:49.856 A:middle
to the roster service
information.

00:09:51.246 --> 00:09:53.756 A:middle
On a parallel track,
when you're interacting

00:09:53.756 --> 00:09:57.256 A:middle
with the Device Enrollment
Program service, you can tell it

00:09:57.256 --> 00:09:59.856 A:middle
that you now support
API v3 by including

00:09:59.856 --> 00:10:01.086 A:middle
that information in the header.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.856 --> 00:10:01.086 A:middle
that information in the header.

00:10:01.356 --> 00:10:03.496 A:middle
And you'll receive the
additional information that's

00:10:03.496 --> 00:10:04.996 A:middle
now available via that API.

00:10:07.326 --> 00:10:09.876 A:middle
I also wanted to pass
along a few best practices

00:10:09.876 --> 00:10:11.006 A:middle
that my team has learned

00:10:11.006 --> 00:10:13.326 A:middle
in adopting this API
in Profile Manager.

00:10:14.526 --> 00:10:16.456 A:middle
The first is really a
strong recommendation

00:10:16.456 --> 00:10:18.596 A:middle
that we think your customers
will really appreciate.

00:10:18.596 --> 00:10:21.836 A:middle
If they have been using
your product for a while,

00:10:21.836 --> 00:10:24.556 A:middle
they've undoubtedly connected it
to their directory to get user

00:10:24.556 --> 00:10:28.026 A:middle
and group information so
that your solution also has a

00:10:28.026 --> 00:10:29.616 A:middle
representation for each user.

00:10:30.616 --> 00:10:32.936 A:middle
Once you connect up to
the roster service API

00:10:33.076 --> 00:10:34.986 A:middle
in Apple School Manager,
you're going

00:10:34.986 --> 00:10:37.006 A:middle
to be getting a second
representation of each user

00:10:37.006 --> 00:10:38.376 A:middle
in the form of the
Managed Apple ID.

00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:41.856 A:middle
And we recommend that you
allow the administrator

00:10:41.856 --> 00:10:43.476 A:middle
to provide some matching
criteria

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.526 A:middle
so that you can automatically
merge those accounts

00:10:46.626 --> 00:10:49.746 A:middle
into one representation of
each student and teacher.

00:10:50.536 --> 00:10:54.216 A:middle
And because that matching won't
catch every single record,

00:10:54.216 --> 00:10:58.076 A:middle
we think you also should allow
manual merging of records

00:10:58.076 --> 00:11:01.196 A:middle
to be able to tell you this
directory user is the same user


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.076 --> 00:11:01.196 A:middle
to be able to tell you this
directory user is the same user

00:11:01.196 --> 00:11:02.416 A:middle
as this Managed Apple ID.

00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:07.636 A:middle
One special note about
records that have been created

00:11:07.636 --> 00:11:12.096 A:middle
by CSV uploads is that the
person number that's uploaded

00:11:12.096 --> 00:11:15.426 A:middle
in the CSV template becomes
the source system identifier

00:11:15.426 --> 00:11:17.496 A:middle
in the API results
that you will receive.

00:11:18.166 --> 00:11:21.056 A:middle
That source system identifier
corresponds to something more

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:24.476 A:middle
like a student ID; it's not
a GUID or a primary key.

00:11:25.076 --> 00:11:27.136 A:middle
So that field can
actually be mutable

00:11:27.136 --> 00:11:28.796 A:middle
and is not guaranteed
to be unique.

00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:30.756 A:middle
And you need to be
prepared for that case.

00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:34.906 A:middle
The final practice I wanted
to pass along was to point

00:11:34.906 --> 00:11:37.306 A:middle
out that there is no delta
API so that you'll need

00:11:37.306 --> 00:11:40.556 A:middle
to do a full enumeration to get
all of the records from the API.

00:11:41.876 --> 00:11:44.956 A:middle
Since the student information
system syncing is only performed

00:11:44.956 --> 00:11:47.606 A:middle
once per day between it
and Apple School Manager,

00:11:48.426 --> 00:11:50.946 A:middle
there's no need to automatically
perform a full sync more

00:11:50.946 --> 00:11:51.936 A:middle
than that frequency.

00:11:52.576 --> 00:11:56.186 A:middle
And in fact, if you give
your users an opportunity

00:11:56.186 --> 00:12:00.956 A:middle
to request a sync, you're going
to need to throttle that so


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:56.186 --> 00:12:00.956 A:middle
to request a sync, you're going
to need to throttle that so

00:12:00.956 --> 00:12:03.686 A:middle
that they're not overwhelming
your product and our system.

00:12:05.356 --> 00:12:09.236 A:middle
Turning from people to devices,
Apple School Manager allows you

00:12:09.236 --> 00:12:11.306 A:middle
to configure the Device
Enrollment Program settings

00:12:11.306 --> 00:12:12.546 A:middle
for your school's devices,

00:12:12.996 --> 00:12:14.666 A:middle
including finding
your purchases,

00:12:14.966 --> 00:12:17.266 A:middle
configuring the details
of your MDM servers,

00:12:17.516 --> 00:12:20.826 A:middle
and then assigning devices
to those MDM servers so that

00:12:20.826 --> 00:12:23.156 A:middle
when they're enrolled they'll
be managed by those servers.

00:12:23.606 --> 00:12:25.966 A:middle
And finally content.

00:12:26.536 --> 00:12:28.356 A:middle
Apple School Manager
allows you to jump

00:12:28.356 --> 00:12:31.016 A:middle
to the Volume Purchase
Program store to buy your apps

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:33.726 A:middle
and books, and it
also offers access

00:12:33.726 --> 00:12:35.216 A:middle
to iTunes U Course Manager.

00:12:35.746 --> 00:12:36.846 A:middle
And I also wanted to mention

00:12:36.846 --> 00:12:39.446 A:middle
that we recently
released iTunes U 3.3

00:12:39.896 --> 00:12:42.576 A:middle
which now supports integration
with Apple School Manager

00:12:42.576 --> 00:12:45.096 A:middle
to pull managed course
information into iTunes U.

00:12:45.096 --> 00:12:50.696 A:middle
Now let's talk about some of
the other details of enrollment

00:12:50.696 --> 00:12:53.126 A:middle
to getting your devices
ready for remote management.

00:12:56.186 --> 00:12:58.116 A:middle
Last year I talked
about a new feature

00:12:58.116 --> 00:13:00.796 A:middle
in iOS 9 called enrollment
optimization.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.116 --> 00:13:00.796 A:middle
in iOS 9 called enrollment
optimization.

00:13:01.186 --> 00:13:05.716 A:middle
And just a recap this allows
the MDM server to include a bit

00:13:05.716 --> 00:13:08.286 A:middle
in the Device Enrollment
Program settings for a device

00:13:08.326 --> 00:13:09.386 A:middle
that I want to you wait

00:13:09.386 --> 00:13:11.546 A:middle
until I'm done configuring
before allowing the user

00:13:11.546 --> 00:13:12.436 A:middle
to use the device.

00:13:13.686 --> 00:13:15.916 A:middle
That setting comes down to
the Mac or the iOS device

00:13:15.916 --> 00:13:17.236 A:middle
in their DEP settings.

00:13:18.376 --> 00:13:21.516 A:middle
It then sends a token
update with device ID back

00:13:21.516 --> 00:13:22.956 A:middle
to the MDM server,
letting it know

00:13:22.956 --> 00:13:24.256 A:middle
that I'm ready to be configured.

00:13:24.256 --> 00:13:27.426 A:middle
The MDM server can then
send as many commands,

00:13:27.426 --> 00:13:30.236 A:middle
install as many configuration
profiles as needed to bring

00:13:30.236 --> 00:13:33.336 A:middle
that device up to
spec. When it's done,

00:13:33.866 --> 00:13:35.906 A:middle
it then sends a device
configured command

00:13:35.906 --> 00:13:38.396 A:middle
to the device, which then
exits the Setup Assistant

00:13:38.496 --> 00:13:41.286 A:middle
and allows the student or the
employee to use the device.

00:13:41.846 --> 00:13:43.756 A:middle
This enables the
organization to ensure

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:46.416 A:middle
that that device is not used
prior to being fully configured.

00:13:47.636 --> 00:13:51.716 A:middle
Now that we have Shared iPad,
there's a new wrinkle here

00:13:52.046 --> 00:13:55.736 A:middle
in that there's a new
action in users signing in.

00:13:56.276 --> 00:14:00.146 A:middle
At that point the Shared iPad
will send a token update back


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:56.276 --> 00:14:00.146 A:middle
At that point the Shared iPad
will send a token update back

00:14:00.146 --> 00:14:00.996 A:middle
to the MDM server.

00:14:01.436 --> 00:14:03.326 A:middle
But in contrast to
the one I just talked

00:14:03.326 --> 00:14:04.836 A:middle
about that's device-specific,

00:14:05.266 --> 00:14:08.016 A:middle
this token update reports
the Managed Apple ID

00:14:08.016 --> 00:14:09.946 A:middle
for the user who signed in.

00:14:10.696 --> 00:14:14.426 A:middle
That enables the MDM server to
send, again, as many commands

00:14:14.426 --> 00:14:16.096 A:middle
as it needs to configure
that device

00:14:16.096 --> 00:14:18.236 A:middle
with any per-user
settings, which I will go

00:14:18.236 --> 00:14:19.156 A:middle
into a bit more later.

00:14:20.566 --> 00:14:25.066 A:middle
One crucial difference between
this Shared iPad feature

00:14:25.066 --> 00:14:28.086 A:middle
and the device-specific
enrollment optimization is

00:14:28.086 --> 00:14:31.576 A:middle
that unlike the prior one
which waits in Setup Assistant

00:14:31.576 --> 00:14:34.516 A:middle
until the MDM server is
done, the user is not blocked

00:14:34.516 --> 00:14:39.096 A:middle
from completing sign in
until the MDM server is done.

00:14:39.416 --> 00:14:43.786 A:middle
A few security best practices.

00:14:43.786 --> 00:14:46.516 A:middle
Those of you who have
been keeping up will know

00:14:46.516 --> 00:14:52.386 A:middle
that we removed support for MD5
in iOS 9.3 for SCEP servers.

00:14:52.876 --> 00:14:57.236 A:middle
We've also deprecated DES,
but we also added AES support.

00:14:57.706 --> 00:15:01.946 A:middle
So the message here is that your
SCEP servers should support 3DES


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:57.706 --> 00:15:01.946 A:middle
So the message here is that your
SCEP servers should support 3DES

00:15:01.946 --> 00:15:05.496 A:middle
or AES as soon as
possible because we want

00:15:05.496 --> 00:15:08.036 A:middle
to be using the most
secure cryptography possible

00:15:08.036 --> 00:15:10.526 A:middle
and it's time to move
on to the modern ones.

00:15:12.926 --> 00:15:15.776 A:middle
Next, a few details about
configuring the Setup Assistant,

00:15:15.776 --> 00:15:18.446 A:middle
one of the other features of
the Device Enrollment Program.

00:15:18.446 --> 00:15:21.736 A:middle
In iOS 9.3.2 we now allow you

00:15:21.736 --> 00:15:25.156 A:middle
to skip the new True Tone
display Setup Assistant pane

00:15:25.156 --> 00:15:26.676 A:middle
on hardware which
has that display.

00:15:28.776 --> 00:15:32.126 A:middle
And new in macOS Sierra, we
have some great new features,

00:15:32.126 --> 00:15:33.786 A:middle
but in fact you might
not want your users

00:15:33.786 --> 00:15:35.286 A:middle
to configure them during setup.

00:15:35.286 --> 00:15:38.976 A:middle
So you can skip the Siri or
the iCloud desktop setup pane.

00:15:39.486 --> 00:15:43.046 A:middle
Now, this is another
advertisement.

00:15:43.046 --> 00:15:45.246 A:middle
I think I've done this now,
this is the third year running

00:15:45.296 --> 00:15:48.186 A:middle
for you MDM vendors to
support MDMServiceConfig,

00:15:48.646 --> 00:15:51.646 A:middle
which allows tools
like Configurator

00:15:51.856 --> 00:15:54.256 A:middle
to obtain information
about your MDM server,

00:15:54.256 --> 00:15:57.066 A:middle
such as the DEP enrollment
URL or where

00:15:57.066 --> 00:15:58.836 A:middle
to fetch the anchor certs.

00:15:59.206 --> 00:16:01.426 A:middle
Profile Manager has supported
this for some time now


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.206 --> 00:16:01.426 A:middle
Profile Manager has supported
this for some time now

00:16:01.426 --> 00:16:05.256 A:middle
and Apple Configurator 2 takes
advantage of it, enabling users

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.766 A:middle
to simply enter the host
name of your MDM server

00:16:08.006 --> 00:16:09.576 A:middle
and Configurator does the rest.

00:16:11.646 --> 00:16:13.456 A:middle
Now let's talk about
Shared iPad.

00:16:15.456 --> 00:16:18.046 A:middle
Of course, this brings
support for multiple users

00:16:18.046 --> 00:16:19.476 A:middle
to iPad in the classroom.

00:16:19.906 --> 00:16:22.126 A:middle
A few details about
installing apps on them.

00:16:22.126 --> 00:16:24.476 A:middle
And then I want to talk a
little bit about the details

00:16:24.476 --> 00:16:25.806 A:middle
of how it preserves user data.

00:16:28.026 --> 00:16:29.576 A:middle
As I mentioned earlier,

00:16:30.286 --> 00:16:33.166 A:middle
Shared iPad requires a
Managed Apple ID to sign into.

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:36.976 A:middle
Once a student signs in
with her Managed Apple ID,

00:16:37.816 --> 00:16:40.796 A:middle
she is also signed into her
iCloud account for data storage,

00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:44.016 A:middle
as well as her iTunes
account for assigning books,

00:16:44.016 --> 00:16:47.206 A:middle
which I'll talk about
in a minute.

00:16:47.326 --> 00:16:49.526 A:middle
It's also used for
supporting iTunes U.

00:16:52.236 --> 00:16:55.346 A:middle
Now, since there isn't
always an Apple ID signed

00:16:55.346 --> 00:16:58.306 A:middle
into a Shared iPad,
you'll want to deploy apps

00:16:58.306 --> 00:17:01.086 A:middle
and install them using device
assignments, which we added


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.306 --> 00:17:01.086 A:middle
and install them using device
assignments, which we added

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:03.966 A:middle
to VPP managed distribution
last fall in iOS 9.

00:17:04.965 --> 00:17:07.425 A:middle
MDM vendors hopefully have all
added support for this already,

00:17:07.425 --> 00:17:09.596 A:middle
but you'll need to use
the newer PurchaseMethod 1

00:17:09.816 --> 00:17:11.195 A:middle
to support device assignments.

00:17:11.856 --> 00:17:14.526 A:middle
All app types are
supported from VPP apps

00:17:14.685 --> 00:17:16.955 A:middle
to [inaudible] apps
to Enterprise apps.

00:17:17.566 --> 00:17:21.886 A:middle
Although in order to distribute
VPP apps via device assignments,

00:17:22.205 --> 00:17:24.726 A:middle
the developer of that app must
have accepted the latest T's

00:17:24.726 --> 00:17:27.326 A:middle
and C's in iTunes Connect
to allow device assignment.

00:17:29.946 --> 00:17:30.806 A:middle
Now let's talk a little bit

00:17:30.806 --> 00:17:32.866 A:middle
about the underlying
architecture.

00:17:33.576 --> 00:17:36.056 A:middle
As I mentioned, the student
data is kept in the Cloud --

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:37.076 A:middle
that's where the truth is.

00:17:37.516 --> 00:17:40.186 A:middle
But once they've signed into
a particular Shared iPad,

00:17:40.356 --> 00:17:42.386 A:middle
their data is downloaded
and cached there.

00:17:42.976 --> 00:17:44.816 A:middle
However, that cache
may be purged

00:17:44.816 --> 00:17:46.046 A:middle
if additional students need

00:17:46.046 --> 00:17:47.736 A:middle
to be accommodated
on that Shared iPad.

00:17:48.596 --> 00:17:50.726 A:middle
Each student can only
see his or her own data.

00:17:52.516 --> 00:17:54.906 A:middle
But if they generate a lot
of data during a session

00:17:54.906 --> 00:17:56.516 A:middle
and they sign out before all

00:17:56.516 --> 00:17:58.706 A:middle
of that data has successfully
uploaded to the Cloud,

00:17:59.326 --> 00:18:02.586 A:middle
Shared iPad will continue to
upload that data at the log


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.326 --> 00:18:02.586 A:middle
Shared iPad will continue to
upload that data at the log

00:18:02.586 --> 00:18:04.866 A:middle
in screen or even if
other students sign in.

00:18:06.056 --> 00:18:08.146 A:middle
The key to all this
working is that all

00:18:08.146 --> 00:18:09.656 A:middle
of your apps are
education ready.

00:18:11.036 --> 00:18:14.336 A:middle
That primarily means that you're
storing all of your app's data

00:18:14.336 --> 00:18:15.706 A:middle
and settings in the Cloud.

00:18:16.316 --> 00:18:18.776 A:middle
We've got a whole session right
after lunch about how best

00:18:18.776 --> 00:18:21.386 A:middle
to make your app education
ready right here in this room,

00:18:21.386 --> 00:18:23.156 A:middle
and I encourage you
come back for that one.

00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:27.716 A:middle
Now, just kind of animation
to explain this a bit better.

00:18:28.746 --> 00:18:31.276 A:middle
Student enters her pass code.

00:18:33.426 --> 00:18:35.456 A:middle
Shared iPad gets her
to the log in screen --

00:18:36.296 --> 00:18:37.696 A:middle
to the Home screen, excuse me.

00:18:38.146 --> 00:18:38.966 A:middle
Downloads her data.

00:18:40.256 --> 00:18:42.866 A:middle
See, she's working on her
project, but now it's time

00:18:42.866 --> 00:18:44.766 A:middle
to sign out, to go
to the next class,

00:18:44.766 --> 00:18:45.566 A:middle
or to go home for the day.

00:18:45.566 --> 00:18:53.886 A:middle
Even back at the login screen
her data continues uploading.

00:18:53.886 --> 00:18:55.466 A:middle
Maybe she was working
on a movie project.

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.066 A:middle
But even if another
student then signs in

00:18:59.066 --> 00:19:01.886 A:middle
and begins downloading his data,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.066 --> 00:19:01.886 A:middle
and begins downloading his data,

00:19:03.386 --> 00:19:05.206 A:middle
the previous student's
data continues uploading

00:19:05.296 --> 00:19:07.136 A:middle
until it's all safely
stored in the Cloud.

00:19:08.216 --> 00:19:11.356 A:middle
But the next student can
begin using the Shared iPad

00:19:11.356 --> 00:19:11.826 A:middle
right away.

00:19:15.016 --> 00:19:18.046 A:middle
So what do you MDM vendors need
to do to support Shared iPad?

00:19:18.096 --> 00:19:20.116 A:middle
Again, hopefully all of
you have done this already.

00:19:20.116 --> 00:19:22.326 A:middle
but for those of you who
may be a little bit behind,

00:19:23.106 --> 00:19:26.136 A:middle
there's a new setting in the
DEP settings very similar

00:19:26.136 --> 00:19:29.756 A:middle
to supervision that tells
the device enter Shared iPad.

00:19:31.186 --> 00:19:33.446 A:middle
You also will want to use
Enrollment Optimization

00:19:33.446 --> 00:19:34.916 A:middle
that I talked about earlier

00:19:34.916 --> 00:19:37.556 A:middle
to set some key options
before student use.

00:19:38.316 --> 00:19:40.186 A:middle
And I'm going to go
into a bit more detail

00:19:40.186 --> 00:19:42.566 A:middle
about both user quota and
lock screen grace period.

00:19:44.786 --> 00:19:45.866 A:middle
So what is the user quota?

00:19:46.516 --> 00:19:48.526 A:middle
Well, it's the maximum
number of the users

00:19:48.526 --> 00:19:50.436 A:middle
which will be cached
locally at any one time.

00:19:50.766 --> 00:19:51.706 A:middle
Let's say six.

00:19:53.906 --> 00:19:56.776 A:middle
iOS will then automatically
calculate how much storage

00:19:56.776 --> 00:19:58.876 A:middle
should be allocated
each of those six users,

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:01.706 A:middle
taking into account
space reserved for iOS,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:01.706 A:middle
taking into account
space reserved for iOS,

00:20:01.706 --> 00:20:03.696 A:middle
as well as books and apps
that you're going to install.

00:20:04.956 --> 00:20:08.246 A:middle
As users log in, their
data is downloaded

00:20:08.246 --> 00:20:10.306 A:middle
and cached on the Shared iPad.

00:20:11.386 --> 00:20:14.926 A:middle
But in this case with a quota of
six, if a seventh user signs in,

00:20:14.926 --> 00:20:19.006 A:middle
one of the user data
caches will be purged.

00:20:19.226 --> 00:20:22.156 A:middle
And we will purge the
least recently used user

00:20:22.306 --> 00:20:24.036 A:middle
who doesn't have any
data still remaining

00:20:24.036 --> 00:20:25.026 A:middle
to upload to the Cloud.

00:20:26.336 --> 00:20:29.616 A:middle
Some guidelines on how to choose
this value, you really want

00:20:29.616 --> 00:20:31.766 A:middle
to try to get it close to
what the number of students

00:20:31.766 --> 00:20:34.176 A:middle
who will actually use the
Shared iPad during the day,

00:20:34.176 --> 00:20:35.826 A:middle
which will typically
be the number

00:20:35.826 --> 00:20:37.116 A:middle
of class periods
you have in a day.

00:20:37.796 --> 00:20:39.976 A:middle
Because if you have too few,

00:20:40.266 --> 00:20:42.376 A:middle
students will have their
data purged more often

00:20:42.376 --> 00:20:43.136 A:middle
than necessary.

00:20:43.686 --> 00:20:45.656 A:middle
And if you choose a number
too large, you're going

00:20:45.656 --> 00:20:50.856 A:middle
to allocate space that's not
actually going to be used.

00:20:50.856 --> 00:20:52.176 A:middle
Lock screen grace period.

00:20:52.866 --> 00:20:55.546 A:middle
So let's imagine we
set this to one minute.

00:20:55.646 --> 00:20:57.346 A:middle
And this option gives
the schools

00:20:57.346 --> 00:20:59.866 A:middle
to choose the right
balance between ease of use

00:20:59.866 --> 00:21:02.416 A:middle
for their students and data
security for their students.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.866 --> 00:21:02.416 A:middle
for their students and data
security for their students.

00:21:02.996 --> 00:21:05.866 A:middle
And I think it's easier to
illustrate with an animation

00:21:05.866 --> 00:21:06.886 A:middle
than for me to talk about it.

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:09.376 A:middle
Again, let's imagine we
set it to one minute.

00:21:10.976 --> 00:21:13.566 A:middle
The teacher asks the students
to put their Shared iPads down.

00:21:14.646 --> 00:21:15.686 A:middle
So the screen locks.

00:21:15.996 --> 00:21:17.566 A:middle
Let's imagine she
doesn't have much to say

00:21:17.566 --> 00:21:20.576 A:middle
and after 30 seconds Mia
swipes to unlock her device

00:21:20.746 --> 00:21:22.686 A:middle
and she gets right back
to work without having

00:21:22.686 --> 00:21:23.656 A:middle
to enter her pass code.

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:26.756 A:middle
Now let's imagine the
teacher has rather more to say

00:21:28.126 --> 00:21:30.056 A:middle
and Mia swipes after
five minutes.

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:33.006 A:middle
She will be prompted to
enter her pass code again.

00:21:33.256 --> 00:21:35.626 A:middle
So, again, this offers an
opportunity for schools

00:21:35.626 --> 00:21:36.966 A:middle
to choose that right balance.

00:21:40.266 --> 00:21:42.166 A:middle
Another detail for
you MDM vendors,

00:21:43.026 --> 00:21:46.856 A:middle
iOS as part of Shared iPad now
has a user channel in addition

00:21:46.856 --> 00:21:48.596 A:middle
to the device channel
that can be used

00:21:48.596 --> 00:21:50.946 A:middle
to send MDM commands
and install profiles.

00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:55.096 A:middle
macOS has had a user
channel all along, of course.

00:21:55.416 --> 00:21:56.376 A:middle
And this is very similar

00:21:56.376 --> 00:21:57.976 A:middle
but with some differences
I'll cover in a moment.

00:21:58.986 --> 00:22:03.076 A:middle
In fact, if your MDM solution
is already sending commands


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.986 --> 00:22:03.076 A:middle
In fact, if your MDM solution
is already sending commands

00:22:03.356 --> 00:22:06.506 A:middle
over the user channel to Macs,
if they were sending them

00:22:06.506 --> 00:22:08.866 A:middle
to iOS devices previously,
they would have been ignored.

00:22:08.986 --> 00:22:11.126 A:middle
But with iOS devices 9.3

00:22:11.266 --> 00:22:13.766 A:middle
and later they will now
pay attention to them.

00:22:14.546 --> 00:22:16.976 A:middle
There's a subset of
configuration profile payloads

00:22:17.036 --> 00:22:20.426 A:middle
which are able to be
used on the user channel

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:21.626 A:middle
which I'll cover in a moment.

00:22:22.786 --> 00:22:25.886 A:middle
One important difference
between the user channel in iOS

00:22:25.886 --> 00:22:29.616 A:middle
and macOS is that no user
authentication is performed

00:22:29.716 --> 00:22:33.286 A:middle
before delivering those per-user
commands to a Shared iPad.

00:22:33.846 --> 00:22:36.016 A:middle
So you should never send
sensitive information

00:22:36.016 --> 00:22:38.446 A:middle
over user channel, and
in fact, we will enforce

00:22:38.606 --> 00:22:41.316 A:middle
that no credentials are
delivered over the user channel.

00:22:41.896 --> 00:22:44.806 A:middle
That includes the new
Google OAuth account payload

00:22:44.806 --> 00:22:46.516 A:middle
that we introduced in iOS 9.3.

00:22:48.706 --> 00:22:50.786 A:middle
As I mentioned, all
the accounts payloads,

00:22:50.786 --> 00:22:53.476 A:middle
including that new Google OAuth
account payload, are supported

00:22:53.476 --> 00:22:56.146 A:middle
on the user channel, as
are the new notifications,

00:22:56.206 --> 00:22:59.486 A:middle
Home screen layout and Safari
auto-fill domains enhancement

00:22:59.486 --> 00:23:02.656 A:middle
to the domains payload that
we introduced in iOS 9.3.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.486 --> 00:23:02.656 A:middle
to the domains payload that
we introduced in iOS 9.3.

00:23:03.116 --> 00:23:06.066 A:middle
The existing restrictions
payload can also be used

00:23:06.066 --> 00:23:09.086 A:middle
on the user channel, including
the new show/hide apps features

00:23:09.086 --> 00:23:10.826 A:middle
that was added in iOS 9.3.

00:23:11.126 --> 00:23:15.756 A:middle
One important detail about
restrictions payloads that may

00:23:15.756 --> 00:23:19.066 A:middle
at first seem confusing
but in fact is not a change

00:23:19.066 --> 00:23:20.436 A:middle
from how they have
always worked,

00:23:22.066 --> 00:23:24.546 A:middle
if a restriction's payload is
delivered on a device channel

00:23:24.606 --> 00:23:27.946 A:middle
and the user channel, they
will be combined by iOS

00:23:27.946 --> 00:23:29.666 A:middle
to compute an effective
restriction

00:23:30.266 --> 00:23:32.636 A:middle
with the most restrictive
setting winning.

00:23:32.866 --> 00:23:34.086 A:middle
This prevents a student

00:23:34.086 --> 00:23:35.986 A:middle
from installing another
configuration profile

00:23:35.986 --> 00:23:38.796 A:middle
without that setting and
freeing him or herself

00:23:38.796 --> 00:23:39.556 A:middle
from that restriction.

00:23:40.966 --> 00:23:43.446 A:middle
The reason this isn't really any
different is this is exactly how

00:23:43.446 --> 00:23:45.406 A:middle
multiple profiles have
always worked even

00:23:45.406 --> 00:23:47.046 A:middle
if delivered all
over device channel.

00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:52.476 A:middle
And with that, I'd like to
ask David Steinberg to come up

00:23:52.476 --> 00:23:54.396 A:middle
and give you a demo of
Shared iPad and some

00:23:54.396 --> 00:23:56.436 A:middle
of the other education features
we released this spring.

00:23:56.786 --> 00:23:57.786 A:middle
David, take it away.

00:23:58.516 --> 00:24:01.736 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:24:02.236 --> 00:24:02.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Todd.

00:24:03.846 --> 00:24:06.286 A:middle
It's great to be here demoing
Shared iPad to all of you.

00:24:07.376 --> 00:24:10.196 A:middle
Let's take a look at
what using Shared iPad

00:24:10.196 --> 00:24:12.436 A:middle
between a couple classes
in a school is like.

00:24:13.816 --> 00:24:17.236 A:middle
To start we'll look
at the log in screen.

00:24:18.026 --> 00:24:20.146 A:middle
Now, you can see the
school's name's at the top.

00:24:20.816 --> 00:24:22.886 A:middle
We have some recent
users of the iPad below,

00:24:23.286 --> 00:24:25.576 A:middle
and then a class list that
the students can choose

00:24:25.576 --> 00:24:26.576 A:middle
from to log in.

00:24:27.786 --> 00:24:30.646 A:middle
When I want to log into this
device I can choose my class

00:24:30.646 --> 00:24:33.406 A:middle
from the list, which is
the class' name and a list

00:24:33.406 --> 00:24:34.656 A:middle
of students to choose from.

00:24:35.396 --> 00:24:38.386 A:middle
If this isn't my class, I can
go back to the class list,

00:24:38.846 --> 00:24:42.256 A:middle
select a separate class, again,
we see the class name and a list

00:24:42.256 --> 00:24:43.496 A:middle
of students we can choose from.

00:24:44.576 --> 00:24:48.186 A:middle
Now, if I'm not in any class
on this device, I can still log

00:24:48.186 --> 00:24:51.286 A:middle
in using any Managed
Apple ID that belongs

00:24:51.286 --> 00:24:53.486 A:middle
to the same organization
as this iPad.

00:24:54.606 --> 00:24:57.186 A:middle
But to demonstrate Shared
iPad today let's go back

00:24:57.246 --> 00:24:58.256 A:middle
to our recent users.

00:24:59.096 --> 00:25:02.656 A:middle
Here we have Ava, a
second-grader, and Liam,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:59.096 --> 00:25:02.656 A:middle
Here we have Ava, a
second-grader, and Liam,

00:25:02.796 --> 00:25:05.586 A:middle
a third-grader, who
both used this iPad

00:25:05.586 --> 00:25:06.716 A:middle
in their classes yesterday.

00:25:07.626 --> 00:25:09.306 A:middle
The second grade class
is about to start.

00:25:09.636 --> 00:25:10.746 A:middle
So let's log in as Ava.

00:25:11.806 --> 00:25:13.146 A:middle
Now, when we log in and log

00:25:13.146 --> 00:25:15.706 A:middle
out our video sync
will cut for a second.

00:25:15.706 --> 00:25:16.416 A:middle
So I'll show you here.

00:25:17.226 --> 00:25:18.816 A:middle
After she enters
her credentials,

00:25:20.106 --> 00:25:23.166 A:middle
they'll authenticate against
the Cloud, authenticate locally

00:25:23.166 --> 00:25:26.726 A:middle
on the device, the iPad will
get ready and then will land

00:25:26.726 --> 00:25:28.216 A:middle
on her personalized Home screen

00:25:28.216 --> 00:25:30.566 A:middle
that the school has
selected for her.

00:25:31.026 --> 00:25:32.386 A:middle
Now, while the video catches up,

00:25:32.536 --> 00:25:34.966 A:middle
let's talk about how this
device has been configured.

00:25:35.746 --> 00:25:37.946 A:middle
The school configured
this device specifically

00:25:37.946 --> 00:25:39.226 A:middle
for second and third-graders.

00:25:39.776 --> 00:25:41.726 A:middle
They chose the apps
that each student

00:25:41.726 --> 00:25:44.696 A:middle
in those grades would use and
then created Home screen layouts

00:25:44.696 --> 00:25:45.886 A:middle
for each of the students

00:25:46.316 --> 00:25:49.566 A:middle
that they would see every
time they land on any iPad

00:25:49.616 --> 00:25:50.926 A:middle
within that organization.

00:25:51.326 --> 00:25:53.196 A:middle
So for Ava, as a second-grader,

00:25:53.256 --> 00:25:55.186 A:middle
they've chosen these
apps and this layout.

00:25:56.276 --> 00:25:59.586 A:middle
You can see iBooks
and Notes in the dock

00:25:59.646 --> 00:26:02.596 A:middle
because those are the most-used
applications by second-graders.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.646 --> 00:26:02.596 A:middle
because those are the most-used
applications by second-graders.

00:26:03.256 --> 00:26:05.566 A:middle
In fact, Ava's been
taking multiple notes

00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:07.396 A:middle
across a variety
of iPads in school.

00:26:07.396 --> 00:26:11.116 A:middle
And you can see that all
of her notes have synced

00:26:11.116 --> 00:26:12.826 A:middle
to this iPad from iCloud.

00:26:13.646 --> 00:26:16.826 A:middle
Now, we can create more notes on
this iPad and they'll also sync

00:26:16.826 --> 00:26:18.336 A:middle
and be available on other iPads.

00:26:19.076 --> 00:26:21.886 A:middle
Today her class was
learning about WWDC.

00:26:22.296 --> 00:26:23.426 A:middle
Of course, it's a great topic.

00:26:24.046 --> 00:26:25.606 A:middle
So let's help her
out by taking note

00:26:25.706 --> 00:26:26.826 A:middle
to commemorate this session.

00:26:27.726 --> 00:26:29.056 A:middle
In fact, let's take
a little video.

00:26:31.916 --> 00:26:34.276 A:middle
All right, everybody,
say, "WWDC."

00:26:34.746 --> 00:26:34.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; WWDC.

00:26:35.556 --> 00:26:37.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Woo-hoo.

00:26:38.266 --> 00:26:40.926 A:middle
Perfect. Now she'll
remember this forever.

00:26:42.216 --> 00:26:47.196 A:middle
Unfortunately, it's time for her
to end the class and log out.

00:26:47.446 --> 00:26:50.496 A:middle
Now, when Ava logs out
the device lets her know

00:26:50.536 --> 00:26:54.316 A:middle
which applications are saving
data, and any data that needs

00:26:54.316 --> 00:26:56.966 A:middle
to be synced afterwards
at the log in screen

00:26:56.966 --> 00:26:59.606 A:middle
or when another user is
logged in is prepared then.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:00.456 --> 00:27:02.906 A:middle
So when we land back at
the log in screen or log

00:27:02.906 --> 00:27:05.896 A:middle
in as another user, that
data can continue uploading

00:27:05.896 --> 00:27:06.606 A:middle
in the background.

00:27:07.306 --> 00:27:10.096 A:middle
For example, if we had been
recording this entire session

00:27:10.096 --> 00:27:12.266 A:middle
up to this point instead
of making a little video,

00:27:12.746 --> 00:27:15.426 A:middle
it would be given another
chance now to start uploading.

00:27:16.266 --> 00:27:17.596 A:middle
Now a third grade
class is starting

00:27:17.996 --> 00:27:19.506 A:middle
and Liam is back at this device.

00:27:19.766 --> 00:27:24.126 A:middle
So we'll log in as him.

00:27:24.336 --> 00:27:27.806 A:middle
Again, after we enter his
credentials they authentic,

00:27:27.806 --> 00:27:30.766 A:middle
the iPad gets ready,
and he will land

00:27:30.766 --> 00:27:32.486 A:middle
or his personalized Home screen.

00:27:33.006 --> 00:27:35.766 A:middle
For the third-graders the
school has chosen most

00:27:35.766 --> 00:27:38.006 A:middle
of the same application
as for the second-graders.

00:27:38.636 --> 00:27:40.836 A:middle
But they've also included a
couple extra applications,

00:27:40.986 --> 00:27:42.276 A:middle
including the ones from iWork

00:27:42.626 --> 00:27:45.006 A:middle
because the third-graders
produce multiple presentations

00:27:45.006 --> 00:27:45.646 A:middle
throughout the year.

00:27:46.146 --> 00:27:48.446 A:middle
And they've also included
an app like Safari

00:27:48.446 --> 00:27:50.166 A:middle
so that the students
can do research

00:27:50.166 --> 00:27:51.336 A:middle
for those presentations.

00:27:52.006 --> 00:27:53.436 A:middle
So if you look at the dock,

00:27:53.746 --> 00:27:56.666 A:middle
you'll see that Liam also
has iBooks and Notes,

00:27:57.036 --> 00:27:58.796 A:middle
but he now has Maps and Safari

00:27:59.206 --> 00:28:01.236 A:middle
because the third-graders
are studying the geography


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.206 --> 00:28:01.236 A:middle
because the third-graders
are studying the geography

00:28:01.236 --> 00:28:03.296 A:middle
and history of the great
state of California.

00:28:04.566 --> 00:28:07.366 A:middle
Now, Liam needs to put together
some notes in preparation

00:28:07.366 --> 00:28:08.626 A:middle
for a presentation
he'll be giving.

00:28:09.656 --> 00:28:12.826 A:middle
And though Ava just used
this same iPad to take notes,

00:28:13.046 --> 00:28:14.726 A:middle
Liam does not see
any of her notes.

00:28:15.556 --> 00:28:18.516 A:middle
In fact, it looks like Liam has
not been taking very many notes.

00:28:18.766 --> 00:28:21.536 A:middle
So let's help him
get started here.

00:28:21.686 --> 00:28:22.576 A:middle
We'll create a new note.

00:28:23.166 --> 00:28:25.196 A:middle
And Liam's found
some images online

00:28:25.406 --> 00:28:26.566 A:middle
that he'll be able
to include here.

00:28:27.206 --> 00:28:30.246 A:middle
So let's add one of those now.

00:28:30.246 --> 00:28:30.746 A:middle
Oh, beautiful.

00:28:31.476 --> 00:28:32.596 A:middle
California state flag.

00:28:33.246 --> 00:28:35.596 A:middle
That's a great flag and a
great start to some notes.

00:28:36.116 --> 00:28:37.926 A:middle
But unfortunately, class
has come to an end,

00:28:38.156 --> 00:28:39.306 A:middle
so Liam needs to log out.

00:28:41.406 --> 00:28:43.316 A:middle
Thankfully, when he logs out,

00:28:43.646 --> 00:28:46.526 A:middle
he knows that his data is being
saved and it will be available

00:28:46.526 --> 00:28:49.156 A:middle
when he gets home and wants to
continue working on his project.

00:28:50.456 --> 00:28:53.836 A:middle
Every day throughout the entire
day different students can use

00:28:53.836 --> 00:28:57.886 A:middle
the same iPads to work on their
projects, their data's saved

00:28:57.966 --> 00:28:59.116 A:middle
and it's synced and available

00:28:59.116 --> 00:29:01.306 A:middle
across multiple devices
throughout their school.

across multiple devices
throughout their school.

00:29:01.816 --> 00:29:04.936 A:middle
For Ava and Liam, that means
being able to continue working

00:29:04.936 --> 00:29:07.326 A:middle
on their projects wherever
they want, wherever they go.

00:29:07.766 --> 00:29:08.126 A:middle
Thank you.

00:29:08.256 --> 00:29:08.956 A:middle
Back to you, Todd.

00:29:09.516 --> 00:29:13.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:14.046 --> 00:29:15.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, David.

00:29:16.696 --> 00:29:17.596 A:middle
Just a brief recap.

00:29:17.666 --> 00:29:20.996 A:middle
So David showed how you
can preconfigure classes

00:29:20.996 --> 00:29:24.406 A:middle
on Shared iPad's log in screen,
as well as take advantage

00:29:24.406 --> 00:29:27.376 A:middle
of building up a list
of recent users who sign

00:29:27.376 --> 00:29:29.286 A:middle
in with their Managed
Apple ID and pass code.

00:29:30.036 --> 00:29:33.246 A:middle
They had actually signed
in using a [inaudible] user

00:29:33.636 --> 00:29:35.226 A:middle
and demonstrated that Ava

00:29:35.226 --> 00:29:37.656 A:middle
and Liam only see
their own user data

00:29:37.906 --> 00:29:39.486 A:middle
in Notes and over other app.

00:29:40.226 --> 00:29:43.116 A:middle
And in fact, the school can
choose to show a different set

00:29:43.116 --> 00:29:44.736 A:middle
of apps and Home screen layout

00:29:44.876 --> 00:29:46.196 A:middle
for different groups
of students.

00:29:46.586 --> 00:29:49.596 A:middle
Well, that concludes our
getting started section.

00:29:49.776 --> 00:29:51.716 A:middle
Let's continue with
distribution.

00:29:52.616 --> 00:29:55.036 A:middle
We got a few changes to
talk about this year.

00:29:56.386 --> 00:29:57.566 A:middle
And let's get right to it.

00:29:58.246 --> 00:30:01.696 A:middle
So there's a great new feature
tied to Managed Apple IDs


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.246 --> 00:30:01.696 A:middle
So there's a great new feature
tied to Managed Apple IDs

00:30:01.866 --> 00:30:03.366 A:middle
that allows MDM servers

00:30:03.366 --> 00:30:07.266 A:middle
to programmatically link Managed
Apple IDs from an organization

00:30:07.376 --> 00:30:09.556 A:middle
to their Volume Purchase
Program account

00:30:10.236 --> 00:30:13.826 A:middle
so that no invitation process
is necessary because we know

00:30:13.826 --> 00:30:17.986 A:middle
that this account is coming
from that same organization

00:30:17.986 --> 00:30:19.936 A:middle
that wants to distribute
apps and books.

00:30:20.686 --> 00:30:23.796 A:middle
This, of course, does
require that the school's DEP

00:30:23.796 --> 00:30:26.496 A:middle
or Apple School Manager
token and VPP token come

00:30:26.496 --> 00:30:27.716 A:middle
from the same organization.

00:30:28.396 --> 00:30:31.066 A:middle
But as I mentioned earlier,
since the customer doesn't need

00:30:31.066 --> 00:30:33.826 A:middle
to download any new
tokens after the transition

00:30:33.826 --> 00:30:35.916 A:middle
to Apple School Manager,
this should be simpler.

00:30:37.516 --> 00:30:39.776 A:middle
For you MDM vendors,
it is possible

00:30:39.776 --> 00:30:44.226 A:middle
that the school has different
tokens from for DEP and VPP

00:30:44.226 --> 00:30:46.076 A:middle
that appear to be from
different organizations.

00:30:47.626 --> 00:30:50.116 A:middle
There is a dedicated error
code for this failure mode.

00:30:50.116 --> 00:30:53.286 A:middle
So you can try to
perform this association

00:30:53.286 --> 00:30:56.426 A:middle
and just catch the failure and
be able to notify them that,

00:30:56.426 --> 00:30:59.166 A:middle
"Hey, your tokens don't
match, and you'll need to fix

00:30:59.166 --> 00:31:01.256 A:middle
that before we can
give you this feature."


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.166 --> 00:31:01.256 A:middle
that before we can
give you this feature."

00:31:02.016 --> 00:31:03.886 A:middle
Of course, to give this
feature to customers,

00:31:03.886 --> 00:31:05.356 A:middle
you'll have to adopt
the API for it,

00:31:05.426 --> 00:31:07.006 A:middle
which is already
available in production.

00:31:07.726 --> 00:31:09.146 A:middle
And this is going
to be very important

00:31:09.146 --> 00:31:11.726 A:middle
for distributing iBooks
Store books to Shared iPad,

00:31:11.886 --> 00:31:13.626 A:middle
which we'll talk about next.

00:31:15.146 --> 00:31:18.746 A:middle
So how can you get iBooks Store
VPP books to a Shared iPad?

00:31:19.266 --> 00:31:22.976 A:middle
VPP books can only
be assigned to users

00:31:22.976 --> 00:31:25.006 A:middle
and cannot be distributed
to devices.

00:31:25.566 --> 00:31:27.086 A:middle
So the way it will work is

00:31:27.086 --> 00:31:30.236 A:middle
that once you've
assigned the VPP books

00:31:30.316 --> 00:31:34.766 A:middle
to your Managed Apple IDs,
each student when signing

00:31:34.766 --> 00:31:36.626 A:middle
into Shared iPad will
then see them appear

00:31:36.626 --> 00:31:37.706 A:middle
in their iBook Bookshelf,

00:31:37.706 --> 00:31:39.796 A:middle
and they can simply
tap the download button

00:31:39.926 --> 00:31:41.426 A:middle
to get those bits.

00:31:42.306 --> 00:31:46.396 A:middle
The good news is that the second
and on to end student who wants

00:31:46.396 --> 00:31:49.446 A:middle
to use that book on
that iPad will appear

00:31:49.446 --> 00:31:52.636 A:middle
to immediately download because
the bits are already there

00:31:52.636 --> 00:31:55.626 A:middle
on the device and are only
stored once to save storage

00:31:55.666 --> 00:31:57.796 A:middle
and bandwidth of
downloading them repeatedly.

00:31:59.196 --> 00:32:02.516 A:middle
In contrast, non-iBook
Store books like PDFs


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.196 --> 00:32:02.516 A:middle
In contrast, non-iBook
Store books like PDFs

00:32:02.516 --> 00:32:05.856 A:middle
or iBooks author documents or
EPUBs can be device assigned

00:32:05.856 --> 00:32:08.666 A:middle
and managed just like
assigning apps to Shared iPad.

00:32:10.896 --> 00:32:14.386 A:middle
Finally, a few important
points in some chance we made

00:32:14.386 --> 00:32:15.566 A:middle
to how Enterprise apps

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:17.666 A:middle
with universal provisioning
profiles worked

00:32:17.666 --> 00:32:20.326 A:middle
that were introduced
in iOS 9 but proved

00:32:20.326 --> 00:32:21.576 A:middle
to be somewhat confusing.

00:32:22.996 --> 00:32:26.196 A:middle
These universal provisioning
profiles allow a non-App Store

00:32:26.196 --> 00:32:30.046 A:middle
app to run even if that
specific device is not defined

00:32:30.046 --> 00:32:32.806 A:middle
on the provisioning profile
accompanying the app.

00:32:32.956 --> 00:32:37.966 A:middle
For this to work, it requires
both initial trust by the user

00:32:37.966 --> 00:32:42.286 A:middle
of that app signer, as well
as ongoing periodic validation

00:32:42.286 --> 00:32:45.406 A:middle
by Apple that that specific
universal provisioning profile

00:32:45.406 --> 00:32:46.206 A:middle
remains valid.

00:32:48.706 --> 00:32:51.946 A:middle
So, again, when installing one
of these apps by any way other

00:32:51.946 --> 00:32:54.856 A:middle
than MDM, the user must
explicitly trust the app signer.

00:32:55.716 --> 00:32:59.486 A:middle
However, if the device
is enrolled in MDM,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:00.156 --> 00:33:02.906 A:middle
those apps are implicitly
trusted based on the fact

00:33:02.906 --> 00:33:05.056 A:middle
that they trusted
this organization

00:33:05.056 --> 00:33:07.126 A:middle
when enrolling in MDM.

00:33:07.626 --> 00:33:08.826 A:middle
However, the second piece

00:33:09.206 --> 00:33:11.856 A:middle
that Apple must consider
this UPP valid for the app

00:33:11.856 --> 00:33:15.206 A:middle
to continue to run requires
that the device be able

00:33:15.206 --> 00:33:18.736 A:middle
to be online occasionally to
see the validation server.

00:33:19.786 --> 00:33:22.906 A:middle
Even MDM installed apps
also still require this

00:33:22.906 --> 00:33:24.056 A:middle
periodic validation.

00:33:24.676 --> 00:33:27.536 A:middle
But an MDM server can
trigger the device to say,

00:33:27.536 --> 00:33:29.776 A:middle
"Go validate all of
these apps right now."

00:33:30.366 --> 00:33:32.666 A:middle
This is a really key
feature for deployments

00:33:32.666 --> 00:33:35.386 A:middle
such as an electronic flight
bag for an airline pilot

00:33:35.776 --> 00:33:37.946 A:middle
that will be offline
for some period of time

00:33:37.946 --> 00:33:38.976 A:middle
on a regular schedule.

00:33:39.606 --> 00:33:41.966 A:middle
The MDM server can tell the
device before it's going

00:33:41.966 --> 00:33:44.776 A:middle
to be offline, "Go ahead and
validate all your apps to ensure

00:33:44.776 --> 00:33:45.846 A:middle
that they continue to run."

00:33:46.336 --> 00:33:49.736 A:middle
And in fact, for
you MDM vendors,

00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:52.456 A:middle
and this is what we've done in
Profile Manager, we recommend

00:33:52.456 --> 00:33:53.266 A:middle
that you just go ahead

00:33:53.266 --> 00:33:56.006 A:middle
and automatically validate
any applications that you see

00:33:56.006 --> 00:33:59.296 A:middle
when fetching the
application list at a sync

00:33:59.446 --> 00:34:03.146 A:middle
that are not validated, and that
will keep them all running all


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.446 --> 00:34:03.146 A:middle
that are not validated, and that
will keep them all running all

00:34:03.146 --> 00:34:03.496 A:middle
the time.

00:34:06.076 --> 00:34:08.246 A:middle
That concludes our
section on distribution.

00:34:08.466 --> 00:34:10.456 A:middle
And now let's move
on to all the changes

00:34:10.456 --> 00:34:12.616 A:middle
in device management
capabilities that are used

00:34:12.616 --> 00:34:15.116 A:middle
in an ongoing basis to
manage your devices remotely.

00:34:15.585 --> 00:34:17.036 A:middle
And to take us through
this section I'd

00:34:17.036 --> 00:34:19.726 A:middle
like to invite Shubham Kedia
up here to walk you through it.

00:34:19.815 --> 00:34:20.386 A:middle
Shubham?

00:34:21.516 --> 00:34:24.166 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:34:24.666 --> 00:34:25.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Todd.

00:34:25.866 --> 00:34:27.136 A:middle
Good morning, everyone.

00:34:28.025 --> 00:34:30.076 A:middle
I'm thrilled to be
here to walk you all

00:34:30.076 --> 00:34:32.585 A:middle
through some great new
management features we've added

00:34:32.585 --> 00:34:34.616 A:middle
to both iOS and macOS this year.

00:34:35.976 --> 00:34:38.315 A:middle
So let's start with iOS 9.3

00:34:38.826 --> 00:34:42.656 A:middle
where we added some brand
new MDM commands and queries

00:34:42.656 --> 00:34:44.166 A:middle
to go alongside Shared iPad.

00:34:45.346 --> 00:34:49.146 A:middle
The settings command was
updated with the ability

00:34:49.146 --> 00:34:51.545 A:middle
to now specify the
maximum number of users

00:34:51.716 --> 00:34:54.436 A:middle
that can have local
accounts on an iPad.

00:34:54.436 --> 00:34:56.156 A:middle
We saw Todd talk
about this earlier.

00:34:57.346 --> 00:35:01.756 A:middle
You can now also toggle
diagnostic submission via MDM.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:57.346 --> 00:35:01.756 A:middle
You can now also toggle
diagnostic submission via MDM.

00:35:03.076 --> 00:35:05.996 A:middle
We added some commands that
are specific to user manager

00:35:05.996 --> 00:35:09.446 A:middle
as well, such as the user list
command, which you can use

00:35:09.446 --> 00:35:12.616 A:middle
to get the list of all users
that have accounts on an iPad

00:35:12.616 --> 00:35:14.546 A:middle
and even get information
like whether

00:35:14.546 --> 00:35:16.046 A:middle
or not they're logged
in, whether

00:35:16.046 --> 00:35:18.366 A:middle
or not they have data that's
left to be synced to the Cloud,

00:35:18.366 --> 00:35:21.096 A:middle
as well as information
about their user quota

00:35:21.386 --> 00:35:22.686 A:middle
and how much space they've used.

00:35:23.986 --> 00:35:25.986 A:middle
There are new commands
to log out users

00:35:26.276 --> 00:35:27.536 A:middle
and delete users as well.

00:35:28.056 --> 00:35:33.936 A:middle
9.3 also introduced MDM Lost
Mode and MDM Activation Lock.

00:35:34.386 --> 00:35:36.186 A:middle
Now, these aren't
specific to Shared iPad;

00:35:36.486 --> 00:35:38.646 A:middle
these work across all
supervised devices.

00:35:38.646 --> 00:35:41.816 A:middle
So you can rest assured that
if a device gets misplaced,

00:35:41.816 --> 00:35:46.326 A:middle
you can remotely enable MDM
Lost Mode with a custom message

00:35:46.326 --> 00:35:48.126 A:middle
and phone number
and even be able

00:35:48.126 --> 00:35:49.406 A:middle
to get the device's location.

00:35:51.476 --> 00:35:53.976 A:middle
For devices like Shared iPads

00:35:53.976 --> 00:35:56.286 A:middle
where you don't have an Apple
ID associated with them,

00:35:56.556 --> 00:36:00.806 A:middle
MDM Activation Lock is also a
great option to prevent theft.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:56.556 --> 00:36:00.806 A:middle
MDM Activation Lock is also a
great option to prevent theft.

00:36:00.806 --> 00:36:02.516 A:middle
Now, before I move
on I'd like to point

00:36:02.516 --> 00:36:04.386 A:middle
out these icons that
you see here.

00:36:04.726 --> 00:36:07.566 A:middle
These represent commands,
queries,

00:36:07.566 --> 00:36:09.486 A:middle
or configuration
profiles that are specific

00:36:09.486 --> 00:36:11.736 A:middle
to either Shared
iPad or supervised

00:36:11.886 --> 00:36:13.246 A:middle
that you'll see throughout
the slides.

00:36:13.246 --> 00:36:19.476 A:middle
9.3 also introduced some
great configuration profiles

00:36:19.626 --> 00:36:22.766 A:middle
that you allow to configure
your devices exactly the way

00:36:22.766 --> 00:36:23.246 A:middle
you want.

00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:26.386 A:middle
The education payload is used

00:36:26.386 --> 00:36:28.746 A:middle
to configure both the
Shared iPad log in screen

00:36:28.836 --> 00:36:30.046 A:middle
as well as Classroom app.

00:36:31.016 --> 00:36:32.306 A:middle
Notifications allows you

00:36:32.306 --> 00:36:34.546 A:middle
to configure exactly the
notifications settings you'd

00:36:34.546 --> 00:36:36.456 A:middle
like for all applications.

00:36:37.196 --> 00:36:39.746 A:middle
You can preapprove or deny
notification from apps

00:36:39.746 --> 00:36:42.976 A:middle
that aren't even installed
yet and even toggle things

00:36:43.026 --> 00:36:44.406 A:middle
like sounds and badges.

00:36:45.426 --> 00:36:48.336 A:middle
The Home screen layout
payload that we saw David use

00:36:48.336 --> 00:36:50.526 A:middle
in his demo earlier can be used

00:36:50.526 --> 00:36:52.656 A:middle
to configure exactly
the arrangement of apps

00:36:52.656 --> 00:36:55.676 A:middle
and folders you'd like
your students to use.

00:36:57.426 --> 00:36:59.626 A:middle
The lock screen message
payload allows you

00:36:59.626 --> 00:37:02.406 A:middle
to specify a custom
footnote that appears both


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.626 --> 00:37:02.406 A:middle
to specify a custom
footnote that appears both

00:37:02.406 --> 00:37:05.666 A:middle
on the lock screen and the
log in screen of Shared iPad.

00:37:07.836 --> 00:37:10.906 A:middle
The exchange and mail payloads
saw some updates as well.

00:37:11.536 --> 00:37:14.976 A:middle
You can now choose whether
you want to allow the use

00:37:14.976 --> 00:37:18.416 A:middle
of Mail Drop when sending
emails from those accounts.

00:37:19.686 --> 00:37:23.066 A:middle
The domains payload has been
updated with the ability

00:37:23.066 --> 00:37:25.286 A:middle
to now specify exactly
the domains

00:37:25.286 --> 00:37:28.806 A:middle
for which Safari will offer to
save and auto fill passwords.

00:37:29.476 --> 00:37:31.316 A:middle
For you Enterprise
folks out there,

00:37:31.596 --> 00:37:33.356 A:middle
we've updated the
VPN payload as well

00:37:33.356 --> 00:37:35.676 A:middle
with some great new
IKEv2 settings,

00:37:36.256 --> 00:37:38.816 A:middle
and the restrictions payload
has in number of new keys.

00:37:39.136 --> 00:37:43.326 A:middle
You can now restrict
things like Apple Music,

00:37:43.556 --> 00:37:46.246 A:middle
iCloud Photo Library,
and iTunes Radio.

00:37:47.466 --> 00:37:50.086 A:middle
You can also choose whether
or not you want students

00:37:50.376 --> 00:37:55.376 A:middle
to be monitored by teachers
when using Classroom app.

00:37:55.636 --> 00:37:59.166 A:middle
You can disable modification
of notification settings,

00:37:59.166 --> 00:38:01.606 A:middle
which you may have set using
the notifications payload,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:59.166 --> 00:38:01.606 A:middle
which you may have set using
the notifications payload,

00:38:02.076 --> 00:38:05.636 A:middle
as well as -- and you also
have the ability to now show

00:38:05.636 --> 00:38:06.896 A:middle
and hide specific apps.

00:38:07.426 --> 00:38:09.826 A:middle
Again, we saw David use
this in his demo earlier.

00:38:09.926 --> 00:38:14.816 A:middle
I'd like to talk a
little bit more in depth

00:38:14.816 --> 00:38:16.016 A:middle
about the education payload.

00:38:16.156 --> 00:38:19.226 A:middle
It's extremely important
that you adopt this

00:38:19.226 --> 00:38:22.406 A:middle
because not only does it
configure which students

00:38:22.406 --> 00:38:25.616 A:middle
and classes you see in the
log in screen of Shared iPad,

00:38:25.996 --> 00:38:28.816 A:middle
but it's also how Classroom
app determines how teacher

00:38:28.816 --> 00:38:31.046 A:middle
and student devices should
connect with each other.

00:38:32.456 --> 00:38:35.866 A:middle
In this payload you'll specify
students, teachers, and classes,

00:38:36.036 --> 00:38:38.106 A:middle
and even be able
to specify photos

00:38:38.376 --> 00:38:39.976 A:middle
for these students and teachers.

00:38:41.276 --> 00:38:43.316 A:middle
You'll do so by specifying URLs.

00:38:43.316 --> 00:38:48.626 A:middle
And it's important that
these URLs are over HTTPS.

00:38:50.026 --> 00:38:53.226 A:middle
When you update these photos,
you should also update the URLs.

00:38:54.786 --> 00:38:57.676 A:middle
Only one such payload can
be installed per device,

00:38:57.676 --> 00:38:59.996 A:middle
and it's important
to note that student

00:38:59.996 --> 00:39:02.466 A:middle
and teacher devices
require different payloads.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.996 --> 00:39:02.466 A:middle
and teacher devices
require different payloads.

00:39:05.496 --> 00:39:08.096 A:middle
So all these payloads that I've
talked about can, of course,

00:39:08.096 --> 00:39:10.406 A:middle
be applied at the device
level so they apply to all

00:39:10.406 --> 00:39:11.976 A:middle
of the users on a Shared iPad.

00:39:12.606 --> 00:39:14.666 A:middle
But there are five
payloads that we support

00:39:14.666 --> 00:39:16.656 A:middle
over the user channel per user.

00:39:17.576 --> 00:39:19.656 A:middle
These include all of
the accounts payloads,

00:39:19.656 --> 00:39:23.106 A:middle
including the new Google
OAuth account, notifications,

00:39:23.376 --> 00:39:26.486 A:middle
Home screen layout, the domains
payload with the new support

00:39:26.486 --> 00:39:30.096 A:middle
for Safari auto fill domains, as
well as the restrictions payload

00:39:30.356 --> 00:39:32.226 A:middle
with the ability to
show and hide apps.

00:39:34.426 --> 00:39:37.076 A:middle
Next let's talk about iOS 9.3.2.

00:39:38.586 --> 00:39:41.706 A:middle
Here we updated the settings
command to allow to you enable

00:39:41.706 --> 00:39:43.156 A:middle
or disable app analytics,

00:39:43.276 --> 00:39:45.406 A:middle
as well as set the lock
screen grace period.

00:39:46.216 --> 00:39:48.946 A:middle
Of course, we also updated
the DeviceInformation

00:39:49.106 --> 00:39:50.586 A:middle
and SecurityInfo queries

00:39:50.896 --> 00:39:52.866 A:middle
to return the correct
state from the device.

00:39:54.046 --> 00:39:55.466 A:middle
One thing to note here is

00:39:55.466 --> 00:39:58.446 A:middle
that the security info query
will actually return pass code

00:39:58.446 --> 00:40:02.016 A:middle
lock grace period and pass code
lock grace period enforced.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:58.446 --> 00:40:02.016 A:middle
lock grace period and pass code
lock grace period enforced.

00:40:02.756 --> 00:40:06.286 A:middle
The enforced value might be more
restrictive than what you've set

00:40:06.286 --> 00:40:10.346 A:middle
from your MDM server since it
can't be made less restrictive

00:40:10.346 --> 00:40:11.666 A:middle
while users are logged in.

00:40:15.516 --> 00:40:18.886 A:middle
Now, one of the great uses
for iPads in a classroom is

00:40:18.886 --> 00:40:19.976 A:middle
for standardized testing.

00:40:20.396 --> 00:40:22.216 A:middle
And we've had two great
solutions for this

00:40:22.216 --> 00:40:24.636 A:middle
in past releases:
Single App mode

00:40:24.706 --> 00:40:26.186 A:middle
and Autonomous Single App mode.

00:40:27.356 --> 00:40:29.876 A:middle
These continue to work the
same as they have before

00:40:29.876 --> 00:40:31.006 A:middle
on supervised devices.

00:40:31.736 --> 00:40:35.436 A:middle
However, now with a new
entitlement that you can add

00:40:35.436 --> 00:40:37.476 A:middle
to your app, you
can use the same API

00:40:37.476 --> 00:40:42.186 A:middle
and also disable five system
features that make sense

00:40:42.186 --> 00:40:43.286 A:middle
for your assessment app.

00:40:44.286 --> 00:40:47.276 A:middle
These include things like
auto correct, Define,

00:40:47.706 --> 00:40:50.946 A:middle
keyboard shortcuts, predictive
keyboard, and spell check.

00:40:51.606 --> 00:40:55.266 A:middle
And for the first time the
entitlement also grants you the

00:40:55.266 --> 00:40:59.346 A:middle
ability to enable this mode on
unmanaged, unsupervised devices.

00:40:59.766 --> 00:41:03.356 A:middle
Of course, we do
have a safe escape


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:59.766 --> 00:41:03.356 A:middle
Of course, we do
have a safe escape

00:41:03.356 --> 00:41:04.936 A:middle
on unmanaged unsupervised
devices

00:41:04.936 --> 00:41:10.626 A:middle
where you can simply reboot
the device and exit this mode.

00:41:10.816 --> 00:41:13.616 A:middle
9.3.2 also added a
new restrictions key

00:41:14.226 --> 00:41:16.576 A:middle
to prevent users from disabling

00:41:16.576 --> 00:41:18.356 A:middle
or enabling diagnostic
submission,

00:41:18.546 --> 00:41:19.736 A:middle
which you may have set via MDM.

00:41:19.736 --> 00:41:24.466 A:middle
Now let's talk about iOS X.

00:41:25.896 --> 00:41:29.826 A:middle
In iOS X we updated the
contacts, exchange, Google,

00:41:29.826 --> 00:41:32.286 A:middle
and the LDAP payloads
to include a new key

00:41:32.546 --> 00:41:34.116 A:middle
for communication service rules.

00:41:35.926 --> 00:41:40.886 A:middle
We saw earlier this week the new
VoIP extension support in iOS X.

00:41:40.886 --> 00:41:41.956 A:middle
And what this key allows you

00:41:41.956 --> 00:41:45.176 A:middle
to do is specify a default
application to be used

00:41:45.366 --> 00:41:48.826 A:middle
when making audio calls to
contacts from these accounts.

00:41:50.496 --> 00:41:52.926 A:middle
The lock screen message
payload has been updated

00:41:52.926 --> 00:41:54.126 A:middle
with new key names as well.

00:41:54.976 --> 00:41:57.756 A:middle
Of course, it remains
completely transparent

00:41:57.756 --> 00:41:59.786 A:middle
for administers creating
such payloads,

00:41:59.786 --> 00:42:02.646 A:middle
but we like MDM vendors to
adopt these new key names


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:59.786 --> 00:42:02.646 A:middle
but we like MDM vendors to
adopt these new key names

00:42:02.706 --> 00:42:04.246 A:middle
as the old ones have
been deprecated.

00:42:06.176 --> 00:42:10.456 A:middle
The VPN payload now has support
for EAP-only authentication

00:42:11.766 --> 00:42:13.566 A:middle
for IKEv2, as well
as the ability

00:42:13.566 --> 00:42:15.976 A:middle
to specify a timeout for IPSec.

00:42:16.776 --> 00:42:20.636 A:middle
PPTP has also been removed
from iOS X and macOS Sierra,

00:42:20.636 --> 00:42:22.496 A:middle
and existing payloads
will not work.

00:42:24.656 --> 00:42:26.866 A:middle
The Wi-Fi payload saw
some updates as well.

00:42:27.886 --> 00:42:32.086 A:middle
You can specify if you want to
bypass captive network detection

00:42:33.156 --> 00:42:35.726 A:middle
and Cisco fast lane
quality of service marking.

00:42:36.216 --> 00:42:38.856 A:middle
And for those of you who know
what it is, it's fantastic.

00:42:40.356 --> 00:42:43.116 A:middle
Finally, the restrictions
payload now has a key

00:42:43.736 --> 00:42:46.006 A:middle
to prevent users from
toggling Bluetooth.

00:42:46.136 --> 00:42:48.676 A:middle
Now, this is extremely
important in the Classroom case

00:42:48.996 --> 00:42:50.676 A:middle
since Classroom relies
on Bluetooth

00:42:51.246 --> 00:42:53.156 A:middle
to connect its student
and teacher devices.

00:42:56.256 --> 00:42:58.406 A:middle
So here are some restrictions

00:42:58.836 --> 00:43:01.316 A:middle
that were introduced before
supervision was created.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:58.836 --> 00:43:01.316 A:middle
that were introduced before
supervision was created.

00:43:01.836 --> 00:43:05.306 A:middle
And we talked last year about
how in a future iOS release we'd

00:43:05.306 --> 00:43:09.176 A:middle
like to deprecate these and
these would stop being enforced

00:43:09.176 --> 00:43:10.606 A:middle
on unsupervised devices.

00:43:11.946 --> 00:43:14.996 A:middle
Now, that future iOS
release is not iOS X,

00:43:15.196 --> 00:43:18.126 A:middle
but we promise we are going
to get rid of them very soon.

00:43:18.196 --> 00:43:21.196 A:middle
So please note that these
will stop being enforced

00:43:21.196 --> 00:43:26.916 A:middle
on unsupervised devices.

00:43:27.076 --> 00:43:28.816 A:middle
Next let's talk about macOS.

00:43:29.876 --> 00:43:31.996 A:middle
Earlier this year we
introduced the ability

00:43:31.996 --> 00:43:34.996 A:middle
to install software updates
from major OS releases

00:43:35.356 --> 00:43:37.606 A:middle
on Macs enrolled in the
Device Enrollment Program.

00:43:38.326 --> 00:43:40.166 A:middle
This is going to be
great come this fall

00:43:40.616 --> 00:43:43.256 A:middle
when macOS Sierra is
released where you'll be able

00:43:43.256 --> 00:43:46.306 A:middle
to install it on
all Macs enrolled

00:43:46.536 --> 00:43:49.636 A:middle
in Device Enrollment Program in
your education or Enterprise.

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:56.546 A:middle
New in macOS Sierra we also
introduced a new configuration

00:43:56.546 --> 00:44:00.336 A:middle
profile payload to
configure the IP firewall


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:56.546 --> 00:44:00.336 A:middle
profile payload to
configure the IP firewall

00:44:00.336 --> 00:44:03.146 A:middle
and added some new updates
to the restrictions payload.

00:44:04.506 --> 00:44:07.006 A:middle
We brought some keys
back to the Mac from iOS,

00:44:07.246 --> 00:44:09.926 A:middle
such as Apple Music,
iCloud Keychain

00:44:10.406 --> 00:44:13.446 A:middle
and iCloud Photo Library,
as well as added some

00:44:13.446 --> 00:44:16.296 A:middle
that are specific to the
Mac, such as Back to My Mac,

00:44:16.756 --> 00:44:19.926 A:middle
Find My Mac, and sharing to
Notes, Reminders, or LinkedIn.

00:44:22.906 --> 00:44:24.796 A:middle
It's been my pleasure
to walk you through some

00:44:24.916 --> 00:44:26.746 A:middle
of these great features
we've added this year.

00:44:26.866 --> 00:44:28.906 A:middle
And with that, I'd like
to turn it back to Todd.

00:44:29.516 --> 00:44:29.846 A:middle
Thank you.

00:44:30.091 --> 00:44:32.091 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:44:32.166 --> 00:44:32.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great job.

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:35.826 A:middle
Thanks. All right.

00:44:35.826 --> 00:44:36.886 A:middle
Thank you very much, Shubham.

00:44:37.226 --> 00:44:39.656 A:middle
Let's turn to our final
section today on tools.

00:44:39.796 --> 00:44:43.246 A:middle
And of course, the most exciting
new tool this year is Classroom.

00:44:43.306 --> 00:44:45.676 A:middle
We talked a little
bit about it earlier

00:44:46.126 --> 00:44:48.916 A:middle
and it offers some amazing
new features, that small,

00:44:48.916 --> 00:44:50.546 A:middle
carefully curated
set of features

00:44:50.546 --> 00:44:53.606 A:middle
for teachers in the classroom.

00:44:53.606 --> 00:44:55.546 A:middle
But instead of hearing
me talk about them,

00:44:55.546 --> 00:44:57.486 A:middle
you can read the
list on the slide.

00:44:57.866 --> 00:45:00.896 A:middle
I'd like to ask Shruti Gupta to
come on up and give you a demo.

I'd like to ask Shruti Gupta to
come on up and give you a demo.

00:45:01.286 --> 00:45:01.886 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:45:08.076 --> 00:45:08.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Todd.

00:45:08.736 --> 00:45:15.056 A:middle
I am so excited to show you one
of our coolest apps, Classroom.

00:45:15.506 --> 00:45:17.486 A:middle
What you see here
is a teacher iPad

00:45:17.566 --> 00:45:18.756 A:middle
that is running Classroom on it.

00:45:18.756 --> 00:45:20.716 A:middle
And there are a bunch
of student iPads

00:45:20.756 --> 00:45:22.596 A:middle
that are configure
as Shared iPad.

00:45:23.086 --> 00:45:25.446 A:middle
And all my students are
sitting right here in front row.

00:45:25.446 --> 00:45:30.196 A:middle
When the class begins, the
teacher assigns students

00:45:30.196 --> 00:45:33.556 A:middle
to the iPads and then students
log in with their pass code.

00:45:34.116 --> 00:45:36.766 A:middle
For this demo the students are
already assigned and logged

00:45:36.766 --> 00:45:38.416 A:middle
in since you've already
seen the log

00:45:38.416 --> 00:45:39.856 A:middle
in process during David's demo.

00:45:41.316 --> 00:45:43.406 A:middle
Now, let's assume that I'm
the teacher of the class

00:45:43.496 --> 00:45:45.886 A:middle
and today we'll be learning
about healthy eating.

00:45:46.396 --> 00:45:48.896 A:middle
And for that I found a really
great article that I want

00:45:48.896 --> 00:45:49.986 A:middle
to share with all my students.

00:45:49.986 --> 00:45:54.866 A:middle
So I'm going to tap on
Navigate, Safari, Favorites,

00:45:55.076 --> 00:45:56.856 A:middle
and select the healthy
eating article.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:02.576 --> 00:46:05.496 A:middle
And it's navigating;
it's opening the URL

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:09.796 A:middle
on all student devices.

00:46:09.796 --> 00:46:13.536 A:middle
Okay. Looks like one
student is offline right now.

00:46:13.756 --> 00:46:15.776 A:middle
But if you look at
the Classroom app,

00:46:15.776 --> 00:46:19.436 A:middle
you can see that Classroom app
created a dynamic group called

00:46:19.436 --> 00:46:22.756 A:middle
Safari, indicating that all
students are now using Safari,

00:46:22.756 --> 00:46:22.986 A:middle
yeah?

00:46:23.836 --> 00:46:27.326 A:middle
And if you tap on the screens,
we can see that article open

00:46:27.326 --> 00:46:30.326 A:middle
up pretty much on
all student iPads.

00:46:30.326 --> 00:46:34.516 A:middle
And I guess some are already
trying to do something else.

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:39.556 A:middle
Kids, pay attention
to the class.

00:46:40.266 --> 00:46:42.266 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:46:42.516 --> 00:46:44.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So for the next
activity let's say I want

00:46:44.306 --> 00:46:45.916 A:middle
to divide the students
into smaller group.

00:46:46.056 --> 00:46:49.326 A:middle
So I'm going to tap on Class
button to create a group,

00:46:49.686 --> 00:46:52.376 A:middle
add a bunch of students
by tapping on their names,

00:46:53.346 --> 00:46:56.596 A:middle
and give the group a
name, let's say Greens.

00:46:57.066 --> 00:47:01.586 A:middle
Now when I launch
this particular group

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:57.066 --> 00:47:01.586 A:middle
Now when I launch
this particular group

00:47:01.586 --> 00:47:03.426 A:middle
into activities specific
for them,

00:47:03.676 --> 00:47:05.376 A:middle
let's say I want Green's group

00:47:05.376 --> 00:47:07.586 A:middle
to make a list of
green vegetables.

00:47:07.736 --> 00:47:10.146 A:middle
I will open Notes app for them

00:47:11.286 --> 00:47:13.496 A:middle
so they can start
working on their activity.

00:47:17.766 --> 00:47:21.956 A:middle
Okay? And while students
are working or their task,

00:47:21.956 --> 00:47:23.056 A:middle
I want to see how they're doing.

00:47:23.056 --> 00:47:25.506 A:middle
So I'm going to go back
to all student group

00:47:25.906 --> 00:47:27.376 A:middle
and observe their screen.

00:47:28.766 --> 00:47:32.296 A:middle
And it seems that Edison is not
paying attention in the class.

00:47:32.826 --> 00:47:33.956 A:middle
Let's take a closer look.

00:47:34.166 --> 00:47:37.486 A:middle
I'm going to tap on
Edison, tap on View Screen,

00:47:38.076 --> 00:47:40.516 A:middle
and clearly she is not
working on her assignment.

00:47:40.516 --> 00:47:42.346 A:middle
So I'm going to go back.

00:47:43.446 --> 00:47:47.246 A:middle
Now I can either lock her screen
by tapping on the Lock button

00:47:47.716 --> 00:47:52.146 A:middle
to get her attention back in the
class, or I can lock her iPad

00:47:52.146 --> 00:47:57.146 A:middle
into Notes app by sliding
the Lock button and tapping

00:47:57.146 --> 00:48:00.366 A:middle
on the Notes so she

00:47:57.146 --> 00:48:00.366 A:middle
on the Notes so she
remains focused on her task.

00:48:01.996 --> 00:48:06.476 A:middle
Once the class ends, I can bring
an end to the class by logging

00:48:06.476 --> 00:48:09.626 A:middle
out all the students iPads
by tap on the Log Out button.

00:48:12.896 --> 00:48:14.736 A:middle
And all the students
are now logging out.

00:48:15.096 --> 00:48:15.546 A:middle
Thank you.

00:48:15.546 --> 00:48:16.396 A:middle
Back to Todd.

00:48:16.546 --> 00:48:17.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Shruti.

00:48:17.406 --> 00:48:19.016 A:middle
It was great of you
to all cooperate

00:48:19.016 --> 00:48:21.376 A:middle
in this amazing stress
test of Classroom

00:48:21.376 --> 00:48:23.906 A:middle
with the most iOS devices
it's ever seen before.

00:48:24.386 --> 00:48:25.196 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:48:26.196 --> 00:48:27.016 A:middle
So what did we see?

00:48:27.166 --> 00:48:29.386 A:middle
We saw Shruti use
Classroom to open an app

00:48:29.386 --> 00:48:33.516 A:middle
on all the student iPads,
create and edit manual groups

00:48:33.516 --> 00:48:34.946 A:middle
in addition to the
dynamic groups

00:48:34.946 --> 00:48:38.406 A:middle
that Classroom creates
automatically, lock a student

00:48:38.406 --> 00:48:40.746 A:middle
into an app to focus
their attention,

00:48:41.496 --> 00:48:44.926 A:middle
view the students' screens to
monitor what they're working on

00:48:44.926 --> 00:48:48.056 A:middle
and redirect as needed,
including locking their device

00:48:48.056 --> 00:48:48.966 A:middle
if they get off track.

00:48:49.516 --> 00:48:53.416 A:middle
So a few brief notes
about some other tools

00:48:53.416 --> 00:48:56.546 A:middle
that we make available to
MDM vendors, some simulators

00:48:56.546 --> 00:48:58.076 A:middle
for the Device Enrollment
Program

00:48:58.076 --> 00:49:01.356 A:middle
and Volume Purchase Program,
which are a great way for them


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:48:58.076 --> 00:49:01.356 A:middle
and Volume Purchase Program,
which are a great way for them

00:49:01.356 --> 00:49:04.466 A:middle
to test their implementation of
the API's for those services,

00:49:04.986 --> 00:49:06.726 A:middle
especially handling
service errors

00:49:06.726 --> 00:49:08.626 A:middle
that may be very
difficult or impossible

00:49:08.836 --> 00:49:11.736 A:middle
to simulate any other way with
the real production service.

00:49:13.066 --> 00:49:15.456 A:middle
The simulators have been
updated to support all

00:49:15.456 --> 00:49:16.896 A:middle
of the new features
we've talked about.

00:49:17.346 --> 00:49:19.246 A:middle
And as always, they're
available for download

00:49:19.246 --> 00:49:20.216 A:middle
on the Developer portal.

00:49:20.376 --> 00:49:22.776 A:middle
And I strongly encourage you to
download and make use of them.

00:49:25.136 --> 00:49:26.736 A:middle
That brings us to the
end of our content.

00:49:28.006 --> 00:49:29.296 A:middle
Just a few summary slides

00:49:29.296 --> 00:49:32.276 A:middle
to cover the key points
for administrators.

00:49:32.966 --> 00:49:35.756 A:middle
If you're a school
administrator, sign up for

00:49:35.756 --> 00:49:38.476 A:middle
and use Apple School Manager
to manage the people, devices,

00:49:38.476 --> 00:49:39.766 A:middle
and content in your school.

00:49:41.436 --> 00:49:45.586 A:middle
Everyone can use the DEP
program for wirelessly enrolling

00:49:45.586 --> 00:49:47.746 A:middle
in their remote management
system of choice,

00:49:48.206 --> 00:49:51.766 A:middle
or you can also use
Configurator to enroll in MDM

00:49:51.766 --> 00:49:54.986 A:middle
or to combine the two using
Configurator's automated

00:49:54.986 --> 00:49:59.876 A:middle
enrollment feature that
allows you to connect devices

00:49:59.876 --> 00:50:02.916 A:middle
to Configurator and complete
the setup assistant based


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:59.876 --> 00:50:02.916 A:middle
to Configurator and complete
the setup assistant based

00:50:02.916 --> 00:50:05.856 A:middle
on the DEP settings without
having to touch each device.

00:50:06.376 --> 00:50:10.026 A:middle
If you're a school and
doing shared deployment,

00:50:10.026 --> 00:50:13.276 A:middle
use Shared iPad with Managed
Apple ID on those devices

00:50:13.886 --> 00:50:17.446 A:middle
and everyone can use VPP managed
distribution to distribute apps

00:50:17.446 --> 00:50:20.146 A:middle
to devices or users
depending on whether you want

00:50:20.146 --> 00:50:23.036 A:middle
to allow your users to use
those apps on multiple devices.

00:50:24.406 --> 00:50:27.956 A:middle
For MDM developers, please add
support for the new features,

00:50:27.956 --> 00:50:32.546 A:middle
including the programmatic
association of Managed Apple IDs

00:50:32.546 --> 00:50:35.826 A:middle
for use with VPP, as well
as all the new features

00:50:35.966 --> 00:50:37.786 A:middle
that Shubham talked
about that are new

00:50:37.786 --> 00:50:39.706 A:middle
in iOS X and macOS Sierra.

00:50:40.476 --> 00:50:42.776 A:middle
Updated documentation
was released yesterday.

00:50:43.676 --> 00:50:47.836 A:middle
And please, again, do test with
the DEP and VPP simulators.

00:50:49.066 --> 00:50:51.116 A:middle
Last but not least,
you app developers,

00:50:52.426 --> 00:50:54.226 A:middle
we want you to get your
app's education ready

00:50:54.676 --> 00:50:57.236 A:middle
by storing your app's data
and preferences in the Cloud.

00:50:57.806 --> 00:51:00.686 A:middle
And you can simulate
testing on a Shared iPad


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:50:57.806 --> 00:51:00.686 A:middle
And you can simulate
testing on a Shared iPad

00:51:00.916 --> 00:51:04.066 A:middle
by testing using your app
moving between two iPads.

00:51:04.586 --> 00:51:06.626 A:middle
And the session immediately
following lunch

00:51:06.626 --> 00:51:09.436 A:middle
about best practices will
go into much more detail

00:51:09.436 --> 00:51:12.796 A:middle
about what you need to do
and how you can test it.

00:51:14.366 --> 00:51:17.236 A:middle
Speaking of which, this is the
session I was just referring to.

00:51:17.236 --> 00:51:18.956 A:middle
Again, right here
in a couple hours.

00:51:20.816 --> 00:51:22.806 A:middle
There's some great
resources we make available

00:51:22.806 --> 00:51:26.556 A:middle
on our website both for
education at Apple.com/education

00:51:27.256 --> 00:51:30.776 A:middle
and for Enterprise at
developer.Apple.com/Enterprise.

00:51:30.996 --> 00:51:32.106 A:middle
I encourage you to check it out.

00:51:33.536 --> 00:51:35.576 A:middle
And finally, there are
some additional resources,

00:51:35.576 --> 00:51:38.126 A:middle
direct links to documentations,
and other resources

00:51:38.126 --> 00:51:42.226 A:middle
at our WWDC 2016
session-specific URL

00:51:42.226 --> 00:51:43.496 A:middle
for Session 303.

00:51:44.026 --> 00:51:46.396 A:middle
And with that, I will thank
you for your attention

00:51:46.396 --> 00:51:48.726 A:middle
and hope you have a
great rest of WWDC.

00:51:48.906 --> 00:51:49.756 A:middle
Thank you very much.
