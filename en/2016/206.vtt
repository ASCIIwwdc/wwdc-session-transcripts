[ Music ]

00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:23.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Welcome to what's
new in tvOS.

00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:26.406 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:26.796 --> 00:00:29.396 A:middle
I'm Hans, and I'm an
engineer on the tvOS team.

00:00:31.216 --> 00:00:34.146 A:middle
We're really thrilled
this year to welcome you

00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:38.926 A:middle
to the very first WWDC for tvOS.

00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:43.606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:45.686 A:middle
So I'd like to begin
this afternoon

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.746 A:middle
with a brief overview of tvOS.

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:52.066 A:middle
And we'll walk you through some
of the new features of tvOS 10.

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:56.766 A:middle
And then we'll take a few of
them and dive into more details.

00:00:57.506 --> 00:00:59.056 A:middle
And we even have
a very good demo.

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:03.636 A:middle
So let's begin.

00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:06.586 A:middle
Just nine months ago we
launched the new Apple TV

00:01:07.336 --> 00:01:09.246 A:middle
and with it the tvOS.

00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:14.106 A:middle
tvOS is a modern
operating system designed

00:01:14.216 --> 00:01:17.696 A:middle
for modern hardware,
which is 64-bit only

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:19.626 A:middle
with no 32-bit runtime.

00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.376 A:middle
So it would save you
nontrivial amount of time

00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:27.496 A:middle
that you'd spent testing
for 32-bit compatibility

00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:30.106 A:middle
or configuring for
32-bit slices.

00:01:30.706 --> 00:01:38.326 A:middle
And unlike your iPhone,
iPad, or even Mac,

00:01:39.436 --> 00:01:41.936 A:middle
the Apple TV is always connected
to a high speed network.

00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:45.936 A:middle
And this makes tvOS
an ideal platform

00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:51.316 A:middle
where you can offload some tasks
like managing your app's assets,

00:01:52.086 --> 00:01:56.276 A:middle
user data, or even your
app's content to technologies

00:01:56.276 --> 00:02:00.076 A:middle
such as CloudKit and
on-demand resources.

00:01:56.276 --> 00:02:00.076 A:middle
such as CloudKit and
on-demand resources.

00:02:02.016 --> 00:02:04.516 A:middle
CloudKit is your interface

00:02:04.516 --> 00:02:07.796 A:middle
to an almost infinite
amount of storage in iCloud.

00:02:09.336 --> 00:02:11.856 A:middle
It offers a structure
storage for your assets.

00:02:11.856 --> 00:02:16.836 A:middle
It also provides a public and
private database for user data.

00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:19.746 A:middle
So as you've heard in
the previous session,

00:02:20.476 --> 00:02:24.346 A:middle
it can be accessed from
across iOS, Mac OS, and tvOS

00:02:24.346 --> 00:02:26.636 A:middle
and can also be shared.

00:02:26.636 --> 00:02:32.486 A:middle
And thanks to iCloud
authentication, you don't have

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:35.546 A:middle
to ask your customers for
a separate login anymore.

00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:41.986 A:middle
And this is still true even if
your app happens to also run

00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:44.586 A:middle
on other platforms that
do not have CloudKit.

00:02:45.786 --> 00:02:50.406 A:middle
And by using CloudKit JS and its
web service API's you don't have

00:02:50.406 --> 00:02:53.346 A:middle
to roll your own solution
and still take advantage

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.116 A:middle
of the security and efficiency.

00:02:55.706 --> 00:03:02.916 A:middle
Now, traditionally customers
had to download an entire app

00:02:55.706 --> 00:03:02.916 A:middle
Now, traditionally customers
had to download an entire app

00:03:03.476 --> 00:03:05.196 A:middle
to be able to launch
and start using it.

00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:09.876 A:middle
And as app grows in size,
this becomes a pain point.

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:15.456 A:middle
Because we don't wait 800
megabytes to download for fun.

00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:19.236 A:middle
And this is not only
frustrating for the users,

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:21.226 A:middle
but also a challenge
for us developers

00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:24.536 A:middle
because customers
may lose an interest

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:29.126 A:middle
in our apps before they
even get to try them.

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:32.626 A:middle
On-demand resources
takes advantage

00:03:32.626 --> 00:03:34.576 A:middle
of Apple TV's constant
connection

00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:37.036 A:middle
and provides a mechanism

00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:39.606 A:middle
by which your app can
launch even before all

00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:40.846 A:middle
of its content is downloaded.

00:03:42.176 --> 00:03:44.656 A:middle
This means for your customers,
they can use the app sooner.

00:03:45.186 --> 00:03:48.016 A:middle
And while the app
is being downloaded,

00:03:49.336 --> 00:03:52.126 A:middle
the system can continue
to download more content

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:55.066 A:middle
so they're ready
when they're needed,

00:03:55.826 --> 00:03:58.376 A:middle
minimizing further wait time.

00:04:00.436 --> 00:04:06.406 A:middle
And also, applications can
be very large, in fact,

00:04:06.786 --> 00:04:09.596 A:middle
much larger than was
traditionally agreeable.

00:04:10.696 --> 00:04:15.096 A:middle
Let's take a look at this.

00:04:15.326 --> 00:04:17.555 A:middle
Every app has a main app bundle

00:04:17.906 --> 00:04:20.086 A:middle
of executable and
base resources.

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:24.336 A:middle
And when using ODR, your
main app bundle can be

00:04:24.706 --> 00:04:26.566 A:middle
up to 200 megabytes.

00:04:28.096 --> 00:04:32.056 A:middle
To this you can add a first
set of content to be downloaded

00:04:32.706 --> 00:04:35.576 A:middle
with the app bundle so they're
ready when the app installs.

00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:41.366 A:middle
For example, this could be the
first three levels of your game.

00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:44.196 A:middle
This first set is called
the initial install tags,

00:04:44.286 --> 00:04:47.946 A:middle
and this can be up
to two gigabytes.

00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:51.416 A:middle
What if you have more contents?

00:04:52.366 --> 00:04:56.676 A:middle
Well, you can specific
additional sets of assets packs

00:04:56.676 --> 00:04:59.406 A:middle
to be downloaded
immediately after the install.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:03.406 A:middle
And this is called
prefetch tags.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:03.406 A:middle
And this is called
prefetch tags.

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:07.506 A:middle
And prefetch tags are
intended for content

00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:10.556 A:middle
that you know you'll need
soon but not soon enough

00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:13.026 A:middle
to justify blocking your
app's initial launch,

00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:16.826 A:middle
thereby preventing your
users from using the app.

00:05:17.806 --> 00:05:26.226 A:middle
So, for example, if your user is
playing level one of your game,

00:05:27.396 --> 00:05:29.426 A:middle
the system will start
downloading levels four,

00:05:29.426 --> 00:05:30.186 A:middle
five, and six.

00:05:31.336 --> 00:05:34.976 A:middle
And by the time the user is
completed with level three,

00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:37.876 A:middle
the next levels are
already downloaded

00:05:37.876 --> 00:05:39.266 A:middle
and waiting for the user.

00:05:40.486 --> 00:05:44.426 A:middle
So the wait has been shifted
from the user to the system.

00:05:44.426 --> 00:05:50.436 A:middle
And the system doesn't mind
waiting, but the users do.

00:05:50.966 --> 00:05:53.266 A:middle
Prefetch tags can be
up to four gigabytes,

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:56.886 A:middle
using the rest of the allowance.

00:05:58.216 --> 00:06:01.276 A:middle
So, for example, if
you spent 500 megabytes

00:05:58.216 --> 00:06:01.276 A:middle
So, for example, if
you spent 500 megabytes

00:06:01.276 --> 00:06:02.496 A:middle
for initial install tags,

00:06:03.416 --> 00:06:07.466 A:middle
then you have 3.5
gigabytes for prefetch tags.

00:06:08.356 --> 00:06:11.176 A:middle
If you've spent all
two gigabytes

00:06:11.176 --> 00:06:12.436 A:middle
of your initial install tags,

00:06:12.896 --> 00:06:15.476 A:middle
then naturally you
have two gigabytes

00:06:15.476 --> 00:06:16.526 A:middle
for your prefetch tags.

00:06:17.756 --> 00:06:20.596 A:middle
What if you had no
initial install tags?

00:06:21.356 --> 00:06:23.256 A:middle
Well, math says it's
four gigabytes

00:06:23.256 --> 00:06:24.256 A:middle
for your prefetch tags.

00:06:24.336 --> 00:06:27.506 A:middle
But you might want to
move some of that content

00:06:27.506 --> 00:06:30.206 A:middle
into initial install tags
so they can be used early.

00:06:35.176 --> 00:06:38.786 A:middle
In similar way as the
app is further used,

00:06:39.526 --> 00:06:41.116 A:middle
more assets packs
can be downloaded.

00:06:41.756 --> 00:06:44.416 A:middle
And the total downloadable
content can be

00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:48.556 A:middle
up to 20 gigabytes, making the
combined size of app bundle

00:06:48.556 --> 00:06:52.996 A:middle
and downloadable content at
a whopping 20.2 gigabytes.

00:06:54.516 --> 00:06:58.126 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:01.666 A:middle
And this is not just a big
number, but a big number

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:01.666 A:middle
And this is not just a big
number, but a big number

00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:04.346 A:middle
that does not feel to the
customers heavy or tedious

00:07:04.956 --> 00:07:07.746 A:middle
because they can get started
sooner and they can continue

00:07:07.746 --> 00:07:10.356 A:middle
to use the app without
much interruption.

00:07:11.896 --> 00:07:16.816 A:middle
Transistor is a great game and
a great example of using ODR.

00:07:17.936 --> 00:07:22.206 A:middle
It has 160 megabytes of app
bundle and 500 megabytes

00:07:22.206 --> 00:07:27.016 A:middle
of initial install tags, so it
downloads and installs quickly.

00:07:27.426 --> 00:07:33.436 A:middle
But thanks to 900
megabytes of prefetch tags,

00:07:33.626 --> 00:07:36.006 A:middle
gamers are continuously
challenged with new,

00:07:36.086 --> 00:07:40.726 A:middle
gorgeous game levels without
virtually any interruption.

00:07:41.246 --> 00:07:44.556 A:middle
But ODR is not just for games.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:50.056 A:middle
One of my favorite
apps is Earthlapse TV.

00:07:51.696 --> 00:07:55.206 A:middle
Earthlapse TV presents
time lapse videos taken

00:07:55.246 --> 00:07:59.536 A:middle
from International Space Station
and creates a virtual window

00:07:59.536 --> 00:08:01.636 A:middle
to the space right
in your living room.

00:07:59.536 --> 00:08:01.636 A:middle
to the space right
in your living room.

00:08:03.076 --> 00:08:07.196 A:middle
It has over one gigabyte of
super high-quality content.

00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:11.176 A:middle
And yet, it downloads
and launches quickly

00:08:11.696 --> 00:08:15.326 A:middle
and there's virtually any wait
jumping from content to content.

00:08:16.096 --> 00:08:19.156 A:middle
So that's ODR.

00:08:20.456 --> 00:08:23.976 A:middle
And that, by the way, is Canada
seen from the Cupola module.

00:08:24.516 --> 00:08:27.206 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:32.015 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at
how we interact with the TV.

00:08:32.206 --> 00:08:35.726 A:middle
We use our phone every day and
we're quite accustomed to it.

00:08:36.436 --> 00:08:39.626 A:middle
But it's unique in
that both our attention

00:08:39.626 --> 00:08:42.456 A:middle
and our action are
right there in front

00:08:42.456 --> 00:08:46.046 A:middle
of us on the touch surface.

00:08:46.716 --> 00:08:48.256 A:middle
When you're looking
at a TV, however,

00:08:48.256 --> 00:08:53.186 A:middle
our attention is 10 feet away
on the other side of the room

00:08:54.226 --> 00:08:57.796 A:middle
and our action is on the
remote right in our hand.

00:08:58.586 --> 00:09:02.396 A:middle
There's no direct
connection between the two.

00:08:58.586 --> 00:09:02.396 A:middle
There's no direct
connection between the two.

00:09:02.986 --> 00:09:06.296 A:middle
tvOS provides a unique
opportunity

00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:09.756 A:middle
to make this experience
more direct and connected.

00:09:10.336 --> 00:09:13.206 A:middle
First is the Siri Remote.

00:09:14.236 --> 00:09:18.876 A:middle
Through its touch surface
Siri Remote enables a new

00:09:18.956 --> 00:09:22.136 A:middle
focused-based interaction
designed specifically

00:09:22.136 --> 00:09:23.256 A:middle
for this kind of environment.

00:09:24.956 --> 00:09:30.446 A:middle
By pressing buttons and using
gestures on the touch surface,

00:09:31.836 --> 00:09:35.426 A:middle
users can move focus from
one element to another,

00:09:36.316 --> 00:09:40.736 A:middle
stop on a specific one, and
click to trigger an action.

00:09:47.556 --> 00:09:49.656 A:middle
To complement this
focused interaction,

00:09:50.206 --> 00:09:53.676 A:middle
tvOS also introduces
a new parallax effect.

00:09:55.486 --> 00:09:58.766 A:middle
The parallax effect gives you
a sense of where your focus is

00:09:59.586 --> 00:10:02.586 A:middle
and also the feeling that you
are connected with the screen.

00:09:59.586 --> 00:10:02.586 A:middle
and also the feeling that you
are connected with the screen.

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:06.456 A:middle
And the best way
to take advantage

00:10:06.456 --> 00:10:10.566 A:middle
of the parallax effect is
by using layered image.

00:10:12.556 --> 00:10:15.716 A:middle
A layered image is an image
type designed for tvOS,

00:10:15.936 --> 00:10:19.336 A:middle
and it increases
depth and dynamism

00:10:19.806 --> 00:10:21.086 A:middle
when an element is in focus.

00:10:21.696 --> 00:10:26.636 A:middle
It can have up to five layers

00:10:27.386 --> 00:10:30.106 A:middle
and is actually required
for the app icon.

00:10:30.626 --> 00:10:34.606 A:middle
And to create a new
layered image,

00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:37.116 A:middle
you can use Xcode's
asset catalog,

00:10:38.196 --> 00:10:40.426 A:middle
the Parallax Previewer
app for Mac OS,

00:10:41.026 --> 00:10:45.356 A:middle
and the Parallax Exporter
plug-in for Photoshop.

00:10:46.046 --> 00:10:48.086 A:middle
And of course, all of these
are available for download

00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:52.346 A:middle
at developer.apple.com.

00:10:52.776 --> 00:10:57.526 A:middle
Now, let's take a step back and
take a look at the Home screen.

00:10:59.156 --> 00:11:01.546 A:middle
The Home screen is where
this 10-foot experience is

00:10:59.156 --> 00:11:01.546 A:middle
The Home screen is where
this 10-foot experience is

00:11:01.626 --> 00:11:02.486 A:middle
best illustrated.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:10.476 A:middle
Above the first row of app icons
is an area called Top Shelf,

00:11:11.956 --> 00:11:17.626 A:middle
and apps placed on the first
row can participate in it.

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:21.586 A:middle
Your apps can present the most
relevant features or contents

00:11:21.866 --> 00:11:25.846 A:middle
as shortcuts to the
content deep inside your app

00:11:26.056 --> 00:11:27.886 A:middle
so your customers can
jump straight to it.

00:11:27.886 --> 00:11:32.676 A:middle
And this could be, for example,
a poster for your movies,

00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:44.026 A:middle
album art for music,
banners, or really anything

00:11:44.566 --> 00:11:46.846 A:middle
that makes sense for your app.

00:11:50.436 --> 00:11:54.346 A:middle
Top Shelf is a great conduit
for bringing customers back

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:56.176 A:middle
into your app, so
we highly recommend

00:11:56.536 --> 00:11:57.416 A:middle
that you take advantage

00:11:57.416 --> 00:12:00.956 A:middle
of it beyond providing
a placeholder image.

00:11:57.416 --> 00:12:00.956 A:middle
of it beyond providing
a placeholder image.

00:12:01.376 --> 00:12:07.876 A:middle
Now let's come back to
the Home screen again.

00:12:08.036 --> 00:12:11.626 A:middle
The Home screen is a collection
of apps you care about.

00:12:12.556 --> 00:12:14.366 A:middle
And as you've heard
in the keynote,

00:12:15.346 --> 00:12:17.246 A:middle
we believe the future
of TV is apps.

00:12:18.746 --> 00:12:21.956 A:middle
And all of this is
enabled by the App Store.

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:28.166 A:middle
The App Store, just like on
iOS, is where you go to browse,

00:12:28.676 --> 00:12:30.596 A:middle
discover, and download apps.

00:12:31.986 --> 00:12:36.636 A:middle
And because it exists
on both iOS and tvOS,

00:12:36.826 --> 00:12:38.576 A:middle
it supports universal purchase.

00:12:39.996 --> 00:12:42.816 A:middle
So if your customer has
downloaded the app on iOS,

00:12:43.636 --> 00:12:45.076 A:middle
they can enjoy the app on tvOS

00:12:45.076 --> 00:12:47.826 A:middle
with just one button
press and for free.

00:12:48.146 --> 00:12:53.326 A:middle
And thanks to Apple TV's
constant connection,

00:12:53.696 --> 00:12:57.386 A:middle
in tvOS 10 we're
introducing auto download.

00:12:58.466 --> 00:13:02.326 A:middle
So apps downloaded on iOS will
be automatically downloaded

00:12:58.466 --> 00:13:02.326 A:middle
So apps downloaded on iOS will
be automatically downloaded

00:13:02.326 --> 00:13:06.826 A:middle
to the TV just like that.

00:13:07.276 --> 00:13:09.106 A:middle
So it's even easier
for your customers

00:13:09.146 --> 00:13:10.326 A:middle
to get a hold of your apps.

00:13:11.846 --> 00:13:16.406 A:middle
But how are you going
build them?

00:13:16.506 --> 00:13:19.606 A:middle
tvOS offers the same
developer tools and languages

00:13:20.696 --> 00:13:23.446 A:middle
as iOS, Mac OS, and watchOS.

00:13:23.446 --> 00:13:27.556 A:middle
And many of the same frameworks
you that already know,

00:13:27.906 --> 00:13:33.066 A:middle
such as UIKit, Foundation,
Core Animation, AVFoundation,

00:13:33.506 --> 00:13:38.436 A:middle
Core Audio, and so on and so
on are all available on tvOS.

00:13:39.566 --> 00:13:43.746 A:middle
And by the way, in tvOS 9.2
we've also brought MapKit to TV.

00:13:44.286 --> 00:13:47.506 A:middle
But this is still a partial list

00:13:47.506 --> 00:13:50.106 A:middle
of a whole lot more you
can pick and choose from.

00:13:50.646 --> 00:13:53.796 A:middle
For example, if you're
developing a game,

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:57.156 A:middle
you'd be excited to learn
that all the game technologies

00:13:57.156 --> 00:14:02.056 A:middle
that you love are all
available on tvOS: Game Center,

00:13:57.156 --> 00:14:02.056 A:middle
that you love are all
available on tvOS: Game Center,

00:14:02.636 --> 00:14:07.266 A:middle
Game Controller, GameplayKit,
Model I/O, MetalKit,

00:14:07.536 --> 00:14:11.636 A:middle
Performance Traders, SpriteKit,
SceneKit and many more,

00:14:11.986 --> 00:14:14.146 A:middle
these are all available
at your disposal.

00:14:15.826 --> 00:14:21.956 A:middle
And finally, tvOS introduces a
brand new high-level framework

00:14:22.436 --> 00:14:23.566 A:middle
called TVMLKit.

00:14:23.566 --> 00:14:28.816 A:middle
TVMLKit makes it
really easy for you

00:14:28.816 --> 00:14:32.186 A:middle
to build content-centric
apps by taking care

00:14:32.186 --> 00:14:34.256 A:middle
of the heavy lifting,
such as layout

00:14:34.696 --> 00:14:36.136 A:middle
and focus management, for you.

00:14:37.286 --> 00:14:41.866 A:middle
And it does so with
predefined templates for layout

00:14:42.636 --> 00:14:44.596 A:middle
and JavaScript for
application logic.

00:14:45.456 --> 00:14:48.326 A:middle
It is really great for rapidly
iteration and deployment.

00:14:48.326 --> 00:14:51.496 A:middle
And, of course, it's tuned
for great performance.

00:14:52.136 --> 00:14:58.256 A:middle
In fact, several of Apple's own
apps are built using TVML --

00:14:58.976 --> 00:14:59.976 A:middle
the Movies app.

00:14:59.976 --> 00:15:05.716 A:middle
And that's right, the App Store
itself is built using TVMLKit.

00:14:59.976 --> 00:15:05.716 A:middle
And that's right, the App Store
itself is built using TVMLKit.

00:15:05.966 --> 00:15:13.606 A:middle
And all of the developer tools
on iOS that helped you fine-tune

00:15:13.606 --> 00:15:18.516 A:middle
and optimize your apps, such
as Unit Testing, App Analytics

00:15:18.926 --> 00:15:27.276 A:middle
and TestFlight are also
available for tvOS.

00:15:27.456 --> 00:15:31.756 A:middle
This year tvOS continues to
offer new and exciting features.

00:15:32.576 --> 00:15:37.346 A:middle
As you've heard in the keynote,
we're bringing HomeKit to the TV

00:15:37.346 --> 00:15:39.926 A:middle
so you can control
HomeKit-compatible accessories

00:15:39.926 --> 00:15:41.266 A:middle
from your TV.

00:15:42.156 --> 00:15:44.106 A:middle
We're also bringing PhotoKit

00:15:44.106 --> 00:15:50.716 A:middle
so your app can leverage your
customers' iCloud photo library.

00:15:50.876 --> 00:15:56.546 A:middle
Using SpriteKit is even easier
thanks to native support

00:15:56.616 --> 00:15:57.536 A:middle
from the focus engine.

00:15:58.376 --> 00:16:02.396 A:middle
Your movement and navigation
will feel more natural

00:15:58.376 --> 00:16:02.396 A:middle
Your movement and navigation
will feel more natural

00:16:03.746 --> 00:16:06.556 A:middle
and fully integrated with
the rest of the OS for free.

00:16:07.866 --> 00:16:12.486 A:middle
Speaking of movement and
navigation, an integral part

00:16:12.486 --> 00:16:14.336 A:middle
of gameplay is how
you control them.

00:16:14.926 --> 00:16:20.096 A:middle
You can hold the Siri
Remote vertically

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:26.046 A:middle
as a lightweight game controller
and use gestures like swipes

00:16:26.196 --> 00:16:30.776 A:middle
and clicks for jumping, for
example, to control a game.

00:16:32.086 --> 00:16:36.236 A:middle
If your title requires
slightly more complex input,

00:16:37.136 --> 00:16:42.546 A:middle
you can hold it landscape as a
micro game pad with basic D-pads

00:16:42.546 --> 00:16:44.266 A:middle
and two-button controls.

00:16:44.266 --> 00:16:50.106 A:middle
Well, if your game title
requires even more complex

00:16:50.106 --> 00:16:52.956 A:middle
input, you can use the
extended game controllers

00:16:52.956 --> 00:16:57.766 A:middle
and as you heard in the State of
the Union, up to four of them.

00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:01.316 A:middle
You now have an option
to require the use

00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:01.316 A:middle
You now have an option
to require the use

00:17:01.316 --> 00:17:02.976 A:middle
of MFI-based game controllers,

00:17:02.976 --> 00:17:06.246 A:middle
and the app store will
prompt the user accordingly

00:17:06.246 --> 00:17:07.076 A:middle
if it's necessary.

00:17:08.806 --> 00:17:13.026 A:middle
We're also bringing
ReplayKit to the TV.

00:17:14.556 --> 00:17:19.116 A:middle
Using ReplayKit, players can
record their gameplays locally

00:17:19.116 --> 00:17:23.705 A:middle
on device and share it
with friends via AirDrop.

00:17:24.925 --> 00:17:28.886 A:middle
But that's not all; game
players can now broadcast their

00:17:28.886 --> 00:17:32.316 A:middle
gameplays live on
services like Mobcrush.

00:17:32.876 --> 00:17:42.446 A:middle
In tvOS 10 we're also
bringing a brand new

00:17:42.656 --> 00:17:45.136 A:middle
UserNotification.framework
with iOS 10

00:17:46.296 --> 00:17:49.776 A:middle
and also
ExternalAccessory.framework

00:17:49.776 --> 00:17:52.406 A:middle
for Bluetooth accessories
from iOS.

00:17:53.756 --> 00:17:58.666 A:middle
We're also shipping a brand
new Apple TV remote app.

00:17:58.966 --> 00:18:02.626 A:middle
And finally, users can set
their system appearance

00:17:58.966 --> 00:18:02.626 A:middle
And finally, users can set
their system appearance

00:18:02.656 --> 00:18:04.096 A:middle
to light or dark.

00:18:04.706 --> 00:18:08.946 A:middle
And when you're actually
building apps,

00:18:10.406 --> 00:18:11.296 A:middle
you have many options.

00:18:11.756 --> 00:18:17.216 A:middle
You might want to use UIKit as
your baseline and take advantage

00:18:17.216 --> 00:18:19.236 A:middle
of all the available frameworks.

00:18:19.826 --> 00:18:22.856 A:middle
If you're already comfortable
with full native frameworks

00:18:22.856 --> 00:18:26.736 A:middle
or if you have an
existing iOS app,

00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:30.546 A:middle
we have some great sessions
this week for to you check out,

00:18:31.066 --> 00:18:35.166 A:middle
including mastering
UIKit on tvOS

00:18:35.346 --> 00:18:38.856 A:middle
where you can take your
UIKit app to the next level.

00:18:38.856 --> 00:18:41.726 A:middle
And in Focus Interaction
on tvOS,

00:18:41.726 --> 00:18:47.016 A:middle
we review the Focus system,
discuss some of the new features

00:18:47.016 --> 00:18:50.646 A:middle
on tvOS 10, and of
course, SpriteKit.

00:18:53.996 --> 00:18:56.726 A:middle
We also recommend that
you check out TVMLKit.

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:01.916 A:middle
TVMLKit is an incredibly
rich framework.

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:01.916 A:middle
TVMLKit is an incredibly
rich framework.

00:19:02.876 --> 00:19:08.186 A:middle
And if your skillset already
includes JavaScript and XML,

00:19:08.776 --> 00:19:12.996 A:middle
it's really easy to use
TVMLKit to rapidly develop

00:19:13.056 --> 00:19:14.866 A:middle
and deploy content-centric apps.

00:19:15.416 --> 00:19:20.746 A:middle
And because TVMLKit is built on
top of UIKit, you can even mix

00:19:20.746 --> 00:19:22.836 A:middle
in UIKit for further
customization.

00:19:23.386 --> 00:19:29.356 A:middle
And these sessions focus on
getting the most out of TVMLKit,

00:19:29.796 --> 00:19:31.916 A:middle
and we highly encourage you
to come -- go check out.

00:19:32.936 --> 00:19:35.176 A:middle
And if you are a game
developer, of course,

00:19:35.996 --> 00:19:38.316 A:middle
all the game technologies
packaged

00:19:38.316 --> 00:19:40.786 A:middle
as GameKit might
well be your choice.

00:19:45.546 --> 00:19:51.096 A:middle
Next I'd like to switch gears
and take a deep dive into some

00:19:51.096 --> 00:19:52.926 A:middle
of the new features in tvOS 10.

00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:55.066 A:middle
And for that, I'd
like to hand it

00:19:55.066 --> 00:19:56.436 A:middle
over to my colleague,
Marshall Huss.

00:19:57.516 --> 00:20:04.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:57.516 --> 00:20:04.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:05.146 --> 00:20:05.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:20:05.816 --> 00:20:06.576 A:middle
My name is Marshall.

00:20:06.656 --> 00:20:07.866 A:middle
I'm a tvOS engineer.

00:20:07.906 --> 00:20:11.096 A:middle
And today we're going to dive
into how you can implement some

00:20:11.096 --> 00:20:14.436 A:middle
of the new features
with tvOS 10.

00:20:15.676 --> 00:20:16.996 A:middle
We heard in the keynote

00:20:16.996 --> 00:20:18.966 A:middle
that there's a new
Apple TV Remote app.

00:20:20.106 --> 00:20:22.756 A:middle
We'll take a look at how
you can use notifications

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:25.656 A:middle
to notify users when you
have new content available.

00:20:26.666 --> 00:20:28.056 A:middle
And finally, we're going to look

00:20:28.296 --> 00:20:30.476 A:middle
at how you can implement
the light/dark appearance

00:20:30.476 --> 00:20:31.906 A:middle
in your app.

00:20:33.796 --> 00:20:38.076 A:middle
So the new Apple TV Remote app
works just like the Siri Remote,

00:20:38.076 --> 00:20:39.826 A:middle
so there's no changes
that are required

00:20:40.266 --> 00:20:41.276 A:middle
for your app to make it work.

00:20:42.296 --> 00:20:45.256 A:middle
It also includes a new
Game Controller layout

00:20:45.726 --> 00:20:47.446 A:middle
so users can use
it to play games.

00:20:47.576 --> 00:20:53.436 A:middle
Now, if the user is using the
app and your app is linked

00:20:53.436 --> 00:20:56.126 A:middle
against the game controller
framework, then they're going

00:20:56.126 --> 00:20:57.956 A:middle
to get a new icon in
their navigation bar

00:20:57.956 --> 00:20:59.196 A:middle
that looks like this.

00:21:00.126 --> 00:21:03.536 A:middle
When that user taps that
icon, they'll get presented

00:21:03.606 --> 00:21:05.336 A:middle
with a Game Controller
layout that they can use

00:21:05.336 --> 00:21:06.336 A:middle
by rotating the phone.

00:21:07.756 --> 00:21:10.386 A:middle
To learn more how
to make the most use

00:21:10.676 --> 00:21:11.956 A:middle
of Game Controller framework,

00:21:11.956 --> 00:21:13.606 A:middle
we have a session coming
up later this week.

00:21:15.036 --> 00:21:17.126 A:middle
Also, as you heard, the
seed is available today.

00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:20.866 A:middle
So go download it
and try it out.

00:21:21.136 --> 00:21:23.966 A:middle
Next we're going to take
a look at notifications

00:21:24.296 --> 00:21:26.316 A:middle
and how you can use
those to notify users

00:21:26.316 --> 00:21:27.956 A:middle
when you have new
content available.

00:21:28.746 --> 00:21:30.326 A:middle
A great way of doing
this you might be used

00:21:30.326 --> 00:21:32.926 A:middle
to is badging your
application icon.

00:21:32.926 --> 00:21:35.126 A:middle
And we've added this
support for tvOS 10.

00:21:36.466 --> 00:21:39.676 A:middle
Now, like iOS you're required
to request permissions

00:21:39.676 --> 00:21:41.936 A:middle
from the user in order to
badge the application icon.

00:21:42.286 --> 00:21:44.206 A:middle
But on tvOS this looks
a little bit different.

00:21:44.726 --> 00:21:46.836 A:middle
They're going to get a
full-screen modal alert.

00:21:47.636 --> 00:21:49.986 A:middle
So make sure that you
that request permission

00:21:49.986 --> 00:21:52.916 A:middle
at an appropriate time, or this
may be the first experience the

00:21:52.916 --> 00:21:55.386 A:middle
user has with your app.

00:21:55.926 --> 00:21:58.906 A:middle
We've also added support
for remote notifications

00:21:58.906 --> 00:22:01.556 A:middle
so you can use Apple's
Push Notification service

00:21:58.906 --> 00:22:01.556 A:middle
so you can use Apple's
Push Notification service

00:22:01.866 --> 00:22:03.136 A:middle
to send remote notifications.

00:22:04.126 --> 00:22:06.716 A:middle
We support two notification
types.

00:22:06.866 --> 00:22:11.986 A:middle
Those are Badge, which we just
saw and also content-available.

00:22:13.466 --> 00:22:16.066 A:middle
Now, if your app is
in the background,

00:22:16.066 --> 00:22:18.646 A:middle
then these content-available
applications will not wake

00:22:18.646 --> 00:22:20.816 A:middle
up your app like you
might be used to in iOS.

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:22.946 A:middle
Let's take a look
at what that means.

00:22:24.136 --> 00:22:26.696 A:middle
So say your user has
new content available.

00:22:26.696 --> 00:22:29.516 A:middle
A great way to notify them would
be to send a Push Notification

00:22:29.596 --> 00:22:31.716 A:middle
with content-available
and a Badge of 1.

00:22:31.876 --> 00:22:34.406 A:middle
If the application's
not open, tvOS will hold

00:22:34.406 --> 00:22:37.596 A:middle
onto this notification and
update the user's Badge.

00:22:37.596 --> 00:22:40.046 A:middle
Now, the user gets
more content-available,

00:22:40.236 --> 00:22:42.186 A:middle
so you can send another
Push Notification

00:22:42.496 --> 00:22:43.856 A:middle
that updates the Badge icon.

00:22:44.826 --> 00:22:49.416 A:middle
tvOS will hold onto the
latest notification and wait

00:22:49.416 --> 00:22:50.286 A:middle
for the app to come back.

00:22:50.286 --> 00:22:52.636 A:middle
And finally, you get
more content-available

00:22:52.636 --> 00:22:53.986 A:middle
and you can update
the Badge again.

00:22:53.986 --> 00:22:56.676 A:middle
When the user is ready
to go back to the app

00:22:56.676 --> 00:22:59.286 A:middle
and see what they have is
new, they can open the app.

00:22:59.466 --> 00:23:02.286 A:middle
And then we deliver that last
notification so you can go

00:22:59.466 --> 00:23:02.286 A:middle
And then we deliver that last
notification so you can go

00:23:02.286 --> 00:23:04.426 A:middle
to your servers and get
maybe any new content

00:23:04.706 --> 00:23:05.296 A:middle
that's available.

00:23:05.296 --> 00:23:09.326 A:middle
In order to support
this you have

00:23:09.326 --> 00:23:11.346 A:middle
to use the new user
notification framework.

00:23:12.066 --> 00:23:15.486 A:middle
If you've implemented
notifications in iOS before,

00:23:15.706 --> 00:23:17.796 A:middle
you might be used to
using the UIKit API's.

00:23:18.436 --> 00:23:20.846 A:middle
Well, those have been
prohibited up until now on tvOS,

00:23:20.846 --> 00:23:22.176 A:middle
and they're going to
remain prohibited.

00:23:22.176 --> 00:23:23.786 A:middle
So in order to fully
support local

00:23:23.786 --> 00:23:25.606 A:middle
and [inaudible] notifications,
you're going to need

00:23:25.606 --> 00:23:28.076 A:middle
to use the new user
notification framework.

00:23:28.076 --> 00:23:30.766 A:middle
We have a few sessions
coming up later this week

00:23:30.766 --> 00:23:34.586 A:middle
on how you can learn to fully
implement those in your app.

00:23:35.176 --> 00:23:38.296 A:middle
And finally today, we're going
it take a look at the new light

00:23:38.296 --> 00:23:39.676 A:middle
and dark appearance on tvOS.

00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:44.486 A:middle
We see that that this is a
system-wide setting to the user.

00:23:45.106 --> 00:23:47.736 A:middle
The user will determine
when they want the change

00:23:47.736 --> 00:23:48.626 A:middle
between light or dark.

00:23:48.816 --> 00:23:50.916 A:middle
Now, something to consider is

00:23:50.916 --> 00:23:53.316 A:middle
that users might have their
rooms in different environments.

00:23:53.316 --> 00:23:55.236 A:middle
It could be in a movie
room, which is dark;

00:23:55.236 --> 00:23:57.516 A:middle
it could be in a living room,
which has a lot of windows.

00:23:57.886 --> 00:24:00.436 A:middle
Or the user may change
it based on time of day.

00:23:57.886 --> 00:24:00.436 A:middle
Or the user may change
it based on time of day.

00:24:01.056 --> 00:24:03.676 A:middle
So it's important in order
to respect your user's choice

00:24:03.676 --> 00:24:05.686 A:middle
to offer them the
best user experience.

00:24:06.006 --> 00:24:09.896 A:middle
In order to fully support
this we've added new API

00:24:09.896 --> 00:24:16.176 A:middle
on the UITraitCollection,
and you must actually opt-in

00:24:16.176 --> 00:24:17.396 A:middle
for the dark appearance.

00:24:19.636 --> 00:24:23.096 A:middle
If you don't opt-in for the dark
appearance, your app will remain

00:24:23.096 --> 00:24:25.356 A:middle
in the light just
like it did in tvOS 9.

00:24:25.516 --> 00:24:30.636 A:middle
So let's take a look at
what it takes for your app

00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:33.176 A:middle
to adopt the new light and
dark system appearance.

00:24:34.716 --> 00:24:38.146 A:middle
The first step is to add a
new key to your Info.plist;

00:24:38.206 --> 00:24:40.766 A:middle
we've added one called
UIUserInterfaceStyle.

00:24:40.866 --> 00:24:44.656 A:middle
If you set a value of Light, it
will always resolve to light.

00:24:44.656 --> 00:24:47.726 A:middle
If you set a value to Dark,
your app will always stay dark.

00:24:48.186 --> 00:24:52.026 A:middle
Or if you use what we recommend,
Automatic, it respects the user

00:24:52.026 --> 00:24:54.946 A:middle
and the system setting and will
propagate that through your app.

00:24:55.406 --> 00:24:59.966 A:middle
If you create new projects
in Xcode 8 for tvOS,

00:25:00.026 --> 00:25:01.666 A:middle
this will actually
default to Automatic.

00:25:03.066 --> 00:25:05.926 A:middle
I mentioned that there is
new API and TraitCollection.

00:25:05.926 --> 00:25:08.536 A:middle
We've added a new property
called .UserInterfaceStyle.

00:25:09.616 --> 00:25:11.346 A:middle
This could have a
value of unspecified,

00:25:11.576 --> 00:25:14.026 A:middle
which might the case if your
view has not been inserted

00:25:14.026 --> 00:25:17.836 A:middle
in the view hierarchy yet, or if
could be light or dark depending

00:25:17.836 --> 00:25:20.516 A:middle
on what the system setting is
and what your app supports.

00:25:21.056 --> 00:25:27.466 A:middle
In order to support
developers adopting this,

00:25:27.466 --> 00:25:29.066 A:middle
we've added developer
tool support

00:25:29.436 --> 00:25:31.516 A:middle
to Interface Builder
and the simulator.

00:25:31.816 --> 00:25:34.456 A:middle
If you use standard
UIKit controls,

00:25:34.456 --> 00:25:36.526 A:middle
these will actually
automatically change for you.

00:25:36.956 --> 00:25:39.586 A:middle
If you're used to using
the appearance proxy,

00:25:39.586 --> 00:25:41.166 A:middle
with a little bit
of refactoring,

00:25:41.166 --> 00:25:44.226 A:middle
you can then specify colors
depend on TraitCollection.

00:25:45.016 --> 00:25:46.476 A:middle
And if you want the
most control,

00:25:46.776 --> 00:25:48.896 A:middle
you can implement
TraitCollectionDidChange

00:25:48.896 --> 00:25:50.516 A:middle
in your views or
view controllers.

00:25:53.386 --> 00:25:56.806 A:middle
Now in Interface Builder
you can specify colors right

00:25:56.806 --> 00:26:00.726 A:middle
in the inspector
for light and dark.

00:25:56.806 --> 00:26:00.726 A:middle
in the inspector
for light and dark.

00:26:00.916 --> 00:26:03.606 A:middle
We added a light and dark
preview to storyboards

00:26:03.606 --> 00:26:05.976 A:middle
so you can rapidly develop
and design your app.

00:26:06.646 --> 00:26:09.256 A:middle
We've also added a shortcut
to the simulator to be able

00:26:09.256 --> 00:26:11.666 A:middle
to quick toggle between
these system appearances.

00:26:14.596 --> 00:26:18.756 A:middle
I mentioned UIKit controls
will automatically update them.

00:26:19.176 --> 00:26:21.206 A:middle
And we use these a lot
in our own system apps.

00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:24.806 A:middle
We see that certain views like
this keyboard or text field

00:26:24.806 --> 00:26:27.186 A:middle
or [inaudible] control
automatically update their style

00:26:27.186 --> 00:26:29.006 A:middle
to look best against
the TV wallpaper.

00:26:29.216 --> 00:26:32.016 A:middle
If you use a table view like
we do in our settings app,

00:26:32.016 --> 00:26:34.796 A:middle
it will automatically adjust
its background colors,

00:26:35.006 --> 00:26:36.926 A:middle
its text color, and
everything to look good.

00:26:36.926 --> 00:26:39.536 A:middle
And if you're using the
system built-in keyboards,

00:26:40.046 --> 00:26:41.506 A:middle
than those adapt as well.

00:26:43.436 --> 00:26:47.546 A:middle
If you're looking to customize
your text, we've added support

00:26:47.546 --> 00:26:49.456 A:middle
to UILabel and UITextView,

00:26:49.756 --> 00:26:51.876 A:middle
so those will automatically
change their color as well.

00:26:53.036 --> 00:26:56.086 A:middle
Text color will be set to
black for the light appearance;

00:26:56.086 --> 00:26:58.636 A:middle
it will be set to white
for the dark appearance.

00:26:59.016 --> 00:27:01.466 A:middle
But one caveat is if you
ever set the text color,

00:26:59.016 --> 00:27:01.466 A:middle
But one caveat is if you
ever set the text color,

00:27:01.756 --> 00:27:03.696 A:middle
then you're responsible
for updating that color

00:27:04.316 --> 00:27:06.346 A:middle
for both those modes
on your own.

00:27:07.816 --> 00:27:11.126 A:middle
We've also added two new
blur styles to the API.

00:27:12.436 --> 00:27:15.016 A:middle
You can now use
UIBlurEffectStyleRegular

00:27:15.096 --> 00:27:17.096 A:middle
or UIBlurEffectStyleProminent.

00:27:17.536 --> 00:27:19.706 A:middle
And we call these
automatic styles.

00:27:19.706 --> 00:27:22.996 A:middle
And they'll actually adjust
the effective blur effect style

00:27:23.116 --> 00:27:24.886 A:middle
based on what the
system setting is.

00:27:24.886 --> 00:27:27.836 A:middle
So if you use
UIBlurEffectStyleRegular

00:27:27.836 --> 00:27:29.006 A:middle
and the system's in light,

00:27:29.006 --> 00:27:30.956 A:middle
it will use
UIBlurEffectStyle.light.

00:27:30.956 --> 00:27:33.696 A:middle
If you use regular and
dark, you'll use dark.

00:27:33.696 --> 00:27:37.326 A:middle
If you use prominent, it will
use .extraLight and .extraDark.

00:27:38.386 --> 00:27:42.996 A:middle
.extraDark will be
coming in a later seed.

00:27:44.366 --> 00:27:47.056 A:middle
Now, you might customize your
app with the appearance proxy.

00:27:47.196 --> 00:27:49.836 A:middle
So you might have code like this

00:27:50.266 --> 00:27:52.776 A:middle
that sets the title
color of a button to red.

00:27:53.496 --> 00:27:54.796 A:middle
With a little bit
of refactorring,

00:27:55.156 --> 00:27:57.316 A:middle
we can vend a TraitCollection
for both light and dark.

00:27:57.646 --> 00:28:01.026 A:middle
And using the appearance
proxy API's we can set a color

00:27:57.646 --> 00:28:01.026 A:middle
And using the appearance
proxy API's we can set a color

00:28:01.026 --> 00:28:02.736 A:middle
for each of those
specific TraitCollections.

00:28:03.196 --> 00:28:06.686 A:middle
Now in this case our button will
use red in the light appearance

00:28:07.026 --> 00:28:08.856 A:middle
and blue in the dark appearance.

00:28:09.476 --> 00:28:13.396 A:middle
And finally, if you want the
most control over these changes,

00:28:13.666 --> 00:28:15.146 A:middle
you can respond to
them directly.

00:28:16.176 --> 00:28:18.406 A:middle
You can do this using
TraitCollectionDidChange

00:28:18.406 --> 00:28:19.916 A:middle
in your views or
view controllers.

00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:21.726 A:middle
Let's take a look at
what an implementation

00:28:21.726 --> 00:28:22.436 A:middle
of this would look like.

00:28:22.826 --> 00:28:25.586 A:middle
First we override
TraitCollectionDidChange

00:28:25.586 --> 00:28:26.376 A:middle
in our view controller.

00:28:27.936 --> 00:28:31.586 A:middle
Then we check to make sure
that UITraitCollection responds

00:28:31.586 --> 00:28:33.186 A:middle
to the new user interface
style property.

00:28:33.346 --> 00:28:36.486 A:middle
This allows us to build this
feature for our users on tvOS 10

00:28:36.816 --> 00:28:39.126 A:middle
but still support users
who might be on tvOS 9.

00:28:39.626 --> 00:28:43.966 A:middle
Next we check to see that the
user interface style actually

00:28:43.966 --> 00:28:47.286 A:middle
changed; otherwise we might be
doing more work than we need.

00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:51.666 A:middle
And finally, we can check
the user interface style

00:28:51.666 --> 00:28:53.626 A:middle
and update our controls
accordingly.

00:28:56.336 --> 00:28:59.246 A:middle
Now, one more advanced use
of this is if you wanted

00:28:59.246 --> 00:29:00.776 A:middle
to override TraitCollections.

00:28:59.246 --> 00:29:00.776 A:middle
to override TraitCollections.

00:29:00.776 --> 00:29:02.996 A:middle
And this might be the case
that if you want your app

00:29:03.466 --> 00:29:06.366 A:middle
to support the automatic style
but may have certain views

00:29:06.366 --> 00:29:08.316 A:middle
or view controllers in
your app that you want

00:29:08.316 --> 00:29:10.366 A:middle
to specify the style itself.

00:29:11.456 --> 00:29:16.406 A:middle
We use this in our system apps,
our product pages and our movies

00:29:16.406 --> 00:29:19.516 A:middle
and TV shows actually
use the artwork to base

00:29:19.516 --> 00:29:20.726 A:middle
on what the elements look like.

00:29:21.166 --> 00:29:24.446 A:middle
In this case we have light
artwork, so we use black text

00:29:24.446 --> 00:29:27.016 A:middle
in button styles that
make the colors pop out.

00:29:27.716 --> 00:29:31.206 A:middle
We also have dark pages where we
use white text on darker styles

00:29:31.206 --> 00:29:33.286 A:middle
and the buttons also
update accordingly.

00:29:35.436 --> 00:29:37.706 A:middle
In order to override
these TraitCollections,

00:29:37.706 --> 00:29:39.956 A:middle
we use API that was
added in iOS 8.

00:29:39.956 --> 00:29:41.836 A:middle
And this is
setOverrideTraitCollection

00:29:41.836 --> 00:29:42.826 A:middle
for ChildViewController.

00:29:43.606 --> 00:29:46.396 A:middle
In order to use this we can
use a small wrapper class.

00:29:47.236 --> 00:29:49.356 A:middle
Let's see what an example
of this might look like.

00:29:50.546 --> 00:29:55.916 A:middle
First we create a new class,
AppearanceViewController,

00:29:55.976 --> 00:29:57.736 A:middle
and we inherit from
UIViewController.

00:29:58.936 --> 00:30:01.816 A:middle
We can add a property that has
the style that we might want

00:29:58.936 --> 00:30:01.816 A:middle
We can add a property that has
the style that we might want

00:30:01.816 --> 00:30:03.466 A:middle
to set in our
ChildViewControllers.

00:30:03.596 --> 00:30:05.226 A:middle
And then we can another property

00:30:05.226 --> 00:30:08.416 A:middle
where we actually set the view
controller in which we want

00:30:08.416 --> 00:30:09.586 A:middle
to set that style for.

00:30:13.576 --> 00:30:16.716 A:middle
Then we use a
setOverrideTraitCollection

00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:19.516 A:middle
for ChildViewController using
the style that we specified.

00:30:19.516 --> 00:30:23.226 A:middle
And finally, we use standard
ChildViewController containment.

00:30:24.446 --> 00:30:26.506 A:middle
Now, if you wanted
to use this class,

00:30:27.166 --> 00:30:29.516 A:middle
we could vend our
AppearanceViewController,

00:30:30.206 --> 00:30:33.096 A:middle
specify the style
that we want for based

00:30:33.096 --> 00:30:36.836 A:middle
on whatever attributes we want,
we can set the ViewController,

00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:39.426 A:middle
and then we can present
it to the user.

00:30:40.376 --> 00:30:44.866 A:middle
Next, I'd like to invite Brandon
up to show you what it takes

00:30:44.866 --> 00:30:46.746 A:middle
to update your app for tvOS 10.

00:30:48.516 --> 00:31:03.186 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:48.516 --> 00:31:03.186 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:03.686 --> 00:31:04.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Marshall.

00:31:04.886 --> 00:31:05.606 A:middle
Hi, everyone.

00:31:05.756 --> 00:31:07.466 A:middle
My name's Brandon,
and I'm really excited

00:31:07.466 --> 00:31:09.706 A:middle
to show you the tvOS app
that we've been working on.

00:31:10.326 --> 00:31:11.936 A:middle
It's called Fireplaces
of the World.

00:31:12.296 --> 00:31:14.586 A:middle
And fireplace enthusiasts
have been loving it so far.

00:31:15.276 --> 00:31:15.996 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:31:16.626 --> 00:31:21.256 A:middle
This app allows to you
bring fireplace styles

00:31:21.256 --> 00:31:23.336 A:middle
from around the world
straight to your living room.

00:31:23.966 --> 00:31:26.606 A:middle
Let's see what a fireplace
from Vermont looks like.

00:31:27.756 --> 00:31:30.666 A:middle
Ahh, doesn't it feel
cozy in here?

00:31:31.316 --> 00:31:34.796 A:middle
I think this is great.

00:31:34.966 --> 00:31:37.586 A:middle
Now, even though the simulator
appearance will set to dark,

00:31:37.666 --> 00:31:39.966 A:middle
our app is using the light
appearance by default

00:31:39.966 --> 00:31:41.636 A:middle
because we haven't
specified a preference.

00:31:42.356 --> 00:31:44.326 A:middle
I'm excited to adopt
the new dark appearance,

00:31:44.426 --> 00:31:45.766 A:middle
so let's go update our app now.

00:31:46.736 --> 00:31:52.306 A:middle
The first thing we need to do is
add the new User Interface Style

00:31:52.306 --> 00:31:53.836 A:middle
key to our Info.plist.

00:32:01.456 --> 00:32:06.166 A:middle
We'll set the value to
automatic and rerun our app.

00:32:06.476 --> 00:32:08.796 A:middle
We chose automatic because
we want our app's appearance

00:32:08.796 --> 00:32:10.426 A:middle
to match the user's
appearance setting.

00:32:16.116 --> 00:32:18.476 A:middle
Okay. This is looking
pretty good so far.

00:32:19.166 --> 00:32:21.486 A:middle
So all of our standard
UIKit views have been

00:32:21.486 --> 00:32:22.656 A:middle
updated automatically.

00:32:22.996 --> 00:32:24.526 A:middle
So in this case the tab bar

00:32:24.526 --> 00:32:26.656 A:middle
and the wallpaper now
have a dark appearance.

00:32:27.256 --> 00:32:29.296 A:middle
For some of you this
might be all you need

00:32:29.296 --> 00:32:30.606 A:middle
to do to update your apps.

00:32:30.896 --> 00:32:33.296 A:middle
However, our designers
have decided

00:32:33.296 --> 00:32:36.286 A:middle
that they want a different logo
color for the dark appearance.

00:32:36.956 --> 00:32:39.956 A:middle
And the background color on the
collection view styles sticks

00:32:39.956 --> 00:32:40.976 A:middle
out a little bit too much.

00:32:40.976 --> 00:32:42.646 A:middle
So let's go make those changes.

00:32:42.736 --> 00:32:45.896 A:middle
So let's go to our
main.storyboard.

00:32:47.696 --> 00:32:50.436 A:middle
And the first thing
we need to do

00:32:50.436 --> 00:32:53.106 A:middle
because this is an
existing project,

00:32:53.476 --> 00:32:57.606 A:middle
we need to enable the trait
variations feature in Xcode 8.

00:32:58.176 --> 00:33:02.146 A:middle
So to do that, we'll go to
the File Inspector and click

00:32:58.176 --> 00:33:02.146 A:middle
So to do that, we'll go to
the File Inspector and click

00:33:02.146 --> 00:33:04.096 A:middle
on this Use Trait
Variations checkbox.

00:33:04.976 --> 00:33:06.716 A:middle
When we do that, we're
going to get a warning

00:33:06.716 --> 00:33:09.036 A:middle
that trait variations
is only compatible

00:33:09.386 --> 00:33:10.676 A:middle
with Xcode 8 or later.

00:33:10.756 --> 00:33:12.036 A:middle
And that's fine,
so we'll continue.

00:33:13.756 --> 00:33:16.926 A:middle
So now we'll click on our logo,
go to the Attributes Inspector.

00:33:17.506 --> 00:33:19.096 A:middle
And there's these
new plus buttons next

00:33:19.096 --> 00:33:20.006 A:middle
to some of the properties.

00:33:20.326 --> 00:33:25.116 A:middle
So we'll click on that and add a
darkinterface for our logo image

00:33:25.116 --> 00:33:26.326 A:middle
and we'll specify yellow.

00:33:27.956 --> 00:33:31.036 A:middle
Now, one cool feature of Xcode 8
is that you can actually switch

00:33:31.036 --> 00:33:33.036 A:middle
between the light and
dark appearances directly

00:33:33.036 --> 00:33:34.156 A:middle
within Interface Builder.

00:33:34.866 --> 00:33:37.306 A:middle
To do that we'll go to the
bottom of our storyboard

00:33:37.306 --> 00:33:39.766 A:middle
and click on this View As:
Apple TV (Light Style).

00:33:40.506 --> 00:33:41.796 A:middle
And we have two options here.

00:33:42.286 --> 00:33:43.946 A:middle
We have light and dark.

00:33:44.056 --> 00:33:48.786 A:middle
When we click dark everything
updates automatically.

00:33:48.966 --> 00:33:52.116 A:middle
So our logo changed color
and also the tab bar

00:33:52.476 --> 00:33:54.486 A:middle
and wallpaper have
changed color as well.

00:33:55.276 --> 00:33:56.886 A:middle
So that looks pretty good.

00:33:56.886 --> 00:33:58.616 A:middle
So let's go update
our background colors.

00:33:59.276 --> 00:34:04.926 A:middle
In our AppDelegate we're
setting the background color

00:33:59.276 --> 00:34:04.926 A:middle
In our AppDelegate we're
setting the background color

00:34:04.926 --> 00:34:07.176 A:middle
of our CollectionViewCell
using the appearance proxy.

00:34:08.016 --> 00:34:09.295 A:middle
Now, we want the
background color

00:34:09.485 --> 00:34:11.406 A:middle
to change based on
specific traits.

00:34:11.485 --> 00:34:13.916 A:middle
So we need to use a
trait-specific appearance proxy.

00:34:14.606 --> 00:34:18.456 A:middle
So first we'll start out by
creating a UITraitCollection.

00:34:18.616 --> 00:34:20.746 A:middle
So let light equals
UITraitCollection

00:34:21.216 --> 00:34:24.726 A:middle
with a UserInterfaceStyle
of light.

00:34:26.916 --> 00:34:29.335 A:middle
Then we'll replace our
generic appearance proxy

00:34:29.746 --> 00:34:31.446 A:middle
with a trait-specific
appearance proxy.

00:34:32.146 --> 00:34:34.235 A:middle
So for TraitCollection,
and we'll pass

00:34:34.235 --> 00:34:35.786 A:middle
in the TraitCollection
we just created.

00:34:36.206 --> 00:34:39.206 A:middle
We'll do the same for dark

00:34:39.505 --> 00:34:41.116 A:middle
and specify a different
background color.

00:34:42.396 --> 00:34:43.485 A:middle
Now, because we can't view this

00:34:43.485 --> 00:34:45.356 A:middle
in Interface Builder,
we'll rerun our app.

00:34:46.636 --> 00:34:49.166 A:middle
We've added a keyboard
shortcut, so you can switch --

00:34:49.525 --> 00:34:50.936 A:middle
quickly switch between the light

00:34:50.936 --> 00:34:53.416 A:middle
and dark appearances
within the simulator.

00:34:54.735 --> 00:34:56.626 A:middle
To do that, we'll
hit Command Shift D

00:34:57.236 --> 00:35:00.096 A:middle
to switch the light appearance
and then Command Shift D

00:34:57.236 --> 00:35:00.096 A:middle
to switch the light appearance
and then Command Shift D

00:35:00.096 --> 00:35:01.636 A:middle
to switch back to
the dark appearance.

00:35:02.856 --> 00:35:04.416 A:middle
So that's looking
pretty good so far.

00:35:04.546 --> 00:35:08.456 A:middle
But I've noticed that the
icon is hard to see now

00:35:08.456 --> 00:35:09.806 A:middle
that we've changed
our background color.

00:35:10.356 --> 00:35:11.986 A:middle
So let's go update that as well.

00:35:13.756 --> 00:35:16.396 A:middle
So we'll go to our to custom
collection ViewCell subclass

00:35:17.286 --> 00:35:19.686 A:middle
and before we were
setting the tint color

00:35:19.766 --> 00:35:21.036 A:middle
in our awakeFromNib function.

00:35:21.946 --> 00:35:23.676 A:middle
Since we want the
tint color to change

00:35:23.676 --> 00:35:25.226 A:middle
when our TraitCollection change,

00:35:25.596 --> 00:35:27.946 A:middle
we'll override the
TraitCollectionDidChange

00:35:28.046 --> 00:35:28.506 A:middle
function.

00:35:30.536 --> 00:35:32.806 A:middle
We'll use the same
color as before

00:35:32.806 --> 00:35:34.176 A:middle
for our light interface style,

00:35:34.746 --> 00:35:37.306 A:middle
and for our dark we'll
actually use a light gray.

00:35:38.746 --> 00:35:43.806 A:middle
Now, TraitCollectionDidChange
is called each time your view is

00:35:43.806 --> 00:35:45.056 A:middle
added to a view hierarchy.

00:35:45.356 --> 00:35:47.486 A:middle
So we remove our
initialization code here.

00:35:47.936 --> 00:35:50.026 A:middle
But for backwards
compatibility reasons,

00:35:50.026 --> 00:35:52.626 A:middle
we'll just leave it in there.

00:35:52.836 --> 00:35:59.756 A:middle
Let's run our app,
see how it looks now.

00:36:00.796 --> 00:36:03.726 A:middle
Okay. That looks much better.

00:36:03.886 --> 00:36:06.056 A:middle
So let's switch to
light appearance,

00:36:06.056 --> 00:36:07.326 A:middle
make sure nothing has changed.

00:36:07.326 --> 00:36:08.586 A:middle
And that still looks good.

00:36:09.116 --> 00:36:09.816 A:middle
And we'll switch back

00:36:09.816 --> 00:36:11.716 A:middle
to the dark appearance,
and that looks great.

00:36:12.536 --> 00:36:15.826 A:middle
So we've just updated our app
to adopt a new dark appearance,

00:36:16.126 --> 00:36:18.366 A:middle
and we're ready to
ship with tvOS 10.

00:36:18.886 --> 00:36:21.016 A:middle
Now I'd like to invite
Hans back up on stage.

00:36:22.516 --> 00:36:27.076 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:36:27.576 --> 00:36:28.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Brandon.

00:36:28.206 --> 00:36:32.026 A:middle
That was a very cool
demo and warm.

00:36:33.766 --> 00:36:36.986 A:middle
So as you've seen,
adopting light

00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:38.706 A:middle
and dark appearance
is really easy.

00:36:38.906 --> 00:36:43.496 A:middle
So we hope all of you can adopt
it in your apps very soon.

00:36:44.066 --> 00:36:49.546 A:middle
This afternoon we
have seen just a few

00:36:49.546 --> 00:36:51.286 A:middle
of the many features in tvOS.

00:36:52.636 --> 00:36:56.686 A:middle
tvOS offers the same tools,
services, and frameworks

00:36:57.146 --> 00:37:01.976 A:middle
that you already know so it's
really easy to get started.

00:36:57.146 --> 00:37:01.976 A:middle
that you already know so it's
really easy to get started.

00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:05.166 A:middle
And focus-based interaction,
layered images

00:37:05.166 --> 00:37:09.806 A:middle
with parallax effect and Top
Shelf, they all work together

00:37:09.806 --> 00:37:13.436 A:middle
to create a direct and
connected 10-foot experience.

00:37:13.546 --> 00:37:18.776 A:middle
And with Universal
Purchase and Auto Download,

00:37:19.146 --> 00:37:22.536 A:middle
your customers are ever-closer
to enjoying your apps.

00:37:23.636 --> 00:37:27.086 A:middle
We're also shipping a brand
new Apple TV Remote app.

00:37:27.086 --> 00:37:29.706 A:middle
And it's available as a
seed, so please download

00:37:30.066 --> 00:37:31.766 A:middle
and test your app with it.

00:37:33.136 --> 00:37:37.156 A:middle
And with ReplayKit and
SpriteKit support directly

00:37:37.156 --> 00:37:42.096 A:middle
from Focus Engine, game
experiences are even better.

00:37:42.096 --> 00:37:48.196 A:middle
And finally, users can set
their system appearance

00:37:48.386 --> 00:37:49.016 A:middle
to their liking.

00:37:50.706 --> 00:37:53.296 A:middle
We hope you're excited
by what you've seen

00:37:53.846 --> 00:37:57.026 A:middle
and you can learn even more
throughout the great many

00:37:57.026 --> 00:37:58.246 A:middle
sessions this week.

00:37:58.846 --> 00:38:03.526 A:middle
And the Apple TV
Tech Talk videos

00:37:58.846 --> 00:38:03.526 A:middle
And the Apple TV
Tech Talk videos

00:38:03.526 --> 00:38:06.316 A:middle
from earlier this
year are very useful

00:38:06.316 --> 00:38:07.746 A:middle
in guiding you through
the basics.

00:38:08.056 --> 00:38:12.116 A:middle
And they're available at
developer.apple.com as well.

00:38:12.116 --> 00:38:15.736 A:middle
And of course, all this
information is available

00:38:16.096 --> 00:38:16.876 A:middle
on the session link.

00:38:18.276 --> 00:38:20.306 A:middle
Finally, we can't wait

00:38:20.306 --> 00:38:23.256 A:middle
to see the great things you
create for the future of TV.

00:38:24.426 --> 00:38:25.386 A:middle
Thank you so much for coming,

00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:26.836 A:middle
and enjoy the rest
of the conference.
