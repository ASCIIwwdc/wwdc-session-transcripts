[ Music ]

00:00:20.196 --> 00:00:20.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:23.756 A:middle
Welcome everyone to Go
Live with ReplayKit.

00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:25.926 A:middle
In this session, we
are going to tell you

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:28.226 A:middle
about all the new features that
we've added to the framework.

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:30.956 A:middle
I am Ben Harry, a
software engineer

00:00:30.956 --> 00:00:32.786 A:middle
on the Game Technologies
Team here at Apple.

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:35.506 A:middle
And later, you'll be
hearing from Edwin Iskander.

00:00:36.556 --> 00:00:39.776 A:middle
Now we know people love
to record their gameplay

00:00:40.086 --> 00:00:42.036 A:middle
and share those recordings
on social media.

00:00:43.196 --> 00:00:45.256 A:middle
ReplayKit gives our
users those abilities

00:00:45.476 --> 00:00:47.876 A:middle
with little effort required
from you, the developer.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.316 A:middle
To get started today, I am going
to take a few minutes to talk

00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:54.746 A:middle
about the existing features
that are offered with ReplayKit.

00:00:57.696 --> 00:00:59.116 A:middle
ReplayKit provides the ability

00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:01.166 A:middle
to record your app's
audio and visual content.

00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:01.166 A:middle
to record your app's
audio and visual content.

00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:04.406 A:middle
In addition, you may
enable microphone recording.

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:07.846 A:middle
By doing so, your users can
provide voice commentary while

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:08.416 A:middle
playing their games.

00:01:09.376 --> 00:01:10.906 A:middle
After a user trays a recording,

00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.946 A:middle
they may share the
recording directly

00:01:12.946 --> 00:01:15.006 A:middle
from their game using
the System Share sheet.

00:01:16.646 --> 00:01:19.576 A:middle
ReplayKit has a simple API, and
as you're going to see today,

00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:21.726 A:middle
a small amount of
code is required

00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:23.436 A:middle
to bring these features
to your games.

00:01:24.046 --> 00:01:28.686 A:middle
Moving along, ReplayKit will
generate HD-quality videos

00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:31.196 A:middle
with little impact on
your game's performance,

00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:34.446 A:middle
and uses a minimal amount of
power from the device's battery.

00:01:35.886 --> 00:01:39.556 A:middle
Here at Apple, user privacy
is very important to us,

00:01:40.216 --> 00:01:42.356 A:middle
so we have implemented
some privacy safeguards.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:46.386 A:middle
For example, we present a user
prompt before recording begins,

00:01:46.936 --> 00:01:50.036 A:middle
so user's can give permission
before recording their gameplay.

00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:53.756 A:middle
Furthermore, recording
will exclude system UI,

00:01:53.756 --> 00:01:55.176 A:middle
including notifications.

00:01:55.786 --> 00:01:58.306 A:middle
Therefore, when you receive
a text message while you're

00:01:58.306 --> 00:02:01.066 A:middle
playing a game, that message
is not going to be recorded.

00:01:58.306 --> 00:02:01.066 A:middle
playing a game, that message
is not going to be recorded.

00:02:03.186 --> 00:02:06.476 A:middle
Finally, ReplayKit was
made available in iOS 9.

00:02:07.196 --> 00:02:08.806 A:middle
So this is a list of
the current features

00:02:08.806 --> 00:02:10.126 A:middle
that we offer with ReplayKit.

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:14.426 A:middle
Now, I am going to take a
minute to list the new features

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:15.926 A:middle
that have been added
to ReplayKit framework.

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:20.506 A:middle
First up, we are bringing
ReplayKit support to Apple TV.

00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:23.976 A:middle
So now, you'll be able
to record your gameplay

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:26.236 A:middle
and share it directly
from your TV OS games.

00:02:27.076 --> 00:02:29.716 A:middle
The next new feature we've
added is live broadcasting.

00:02:30.206 --> 00:02:33.496 A:middle
Now, users will be able
to broadcast for gameplay

00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:36.326 A:middle
in real-time to third
party broadcast services.

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:40.686 A:middle
And for our third and final
feature, we're adding support

00:02:40.876 --> 00:02:42.406 A:middle
to record the Face Time camera.

00:02:43.256 --> 00:02:45.086 A:middle
In addition, we've
made enhancements

00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:47.076 A:middle
to the microphone recording API.

00:02:49.596 --> 00:02:51.716 A:middle
So before I get into
ReplayKit and Apple TV,

00:02:51.826 --> 00:02:53.486 A:middle
I'm going to take a minute
to give you an overview

00:02:53.486 --> 00:02:54.696 A:middle
of the ReplayKit architecture.

00:02:55.426 --> 00:02:58.566 A:middle
I want to show you how your app
uses the framework to interact

00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:00.826 A:middle
with the operating system
to create a recording.

00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:00.826 A:middle
with the operating system
to create a recording.

00:03:01.786 --> 00:03:05.126 A:middle
So here we have your
application.

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:07.856 A:middle
Your application needs to
notify the operating system

00:03:07.856 --> 00:03:09.186 A:middle
when it wants to
begin recording.

00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:12.856 A:middle
So ReplayKit provides an
RPScreenRecorder class.

00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:15.346 A:middle
You will tell this class
to start recording.

00:03:16.326 --> 00:03:19.056 A:middle
At this moment, a message is
sent to the Replay Daemon.

00:03:19.436 --> 00:03:22.056 A:middle
The Replay Daemon will start
writing your app's data

00:03:22.686 --> 00:03:24.026 A:middle
to a movie file.

00:03:25.936 --> 00:03:27.526 A:middle
When you tell the
RPScreenRecorder

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:31.046 A:middle
to stop recording, the Replay
Daemon will finish writing your

00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:34.096 A:middle
movie, and now we have
a movie on the system.

00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:37.056 A:middle
Now this movie needs to get
back up to your application

00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:41.466 A:middle
so your users can preview
the recording they just made.

00:03:42.036 --> 00:03:46.226 A:middle
To do so, we provide the
RPpreviewViewController.

00:03:46.936 --> 00:03:48.956 A:middle
You present this view
controller in your game,

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.056 A:middle
so now your users
have an interface

00:03:51.056 --> 00:03:52.616 A:middle
where they can preview,
they can edit

00:03:52.616 --> 00:03:54.906 A:middle
and they can share the
video that they just made.

00:03:55.886 --> 00:04:00.476 A:middle
As we just saw, we have
the RPScreenRecorder class.

00:03:55.886 --> 00:04:00.476 A:middle
As we just saw, we have
the RPScreenRecorder class.

00:04:01.086 --> 00:04:02.816 A:middle
This is the class you
will use to start,

00:04:02.916 --> 00:04:04.766 A:middle
stop and to discard recordings.

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:07.386 A:middle
You will also use it to
check the availability

00:04:07.386 --> 00:04:08.636 A:middle
to record on the device.

00:04:09.646 --> 00:04:11.966 A:middle
There is a delegate property
on the RPScreenRecorder,

00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:15.776 A:middle
and it will notify you if the
availability to record changes.

00:04:16.516 --> 00:04:19.916 A:middle
Also it will let you know of
recording stops due to an error.

00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:24.626 A:middle
The second class I brought up
was the RPPreviewController.

00:04:24.996 --> 00:04:26.826 A:middle
You present this view
controller in your game

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:32.556 A:middle
to give your users ability to
preview the recording on iOS,

00:04:32.556 --> 00:04:35.516 A:middle
and to share that recording
directly from the game.

00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:38.676 A:middle
We also have a delegate
method on this class,

00:04:38.726 --> 00:04:41.156 A:middle
and this delegate will let you
know when the user is finished

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.696 A:middle
with the preview user interface.

00:04:43.546 --> 00:04:46.346 A:middle
So this is the reflected
architecture

00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:49.076 A:middle
and the classes you will use
to record and share content

00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:52.516 A:middle
on both iOS and tvOS,
which now brings me

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:53.856 A:middle
to ReplayKit and Apple TV.

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:57.966 A:middle
And to begin I'm going
to show you a demo.

00:05:06.116 --> 00:05:08.016 A:middle
So here I have a
game called Fox.

00:05:08.256 --> 00:05:11.186 A:middle
Fox was developed
for WWDC, 2015.

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:12.406 A:middle
It was developed using SceneKit.

00:05:13.386 --> 00:05:15.506 A:middle
You may also recognize it
because it is available

00:05:15.506 --> 00:05:17.196 A:middle
as sample code on our
developer website.

00:05:18.216 --> 00:05:19.916 A:middle
The goal of this game
is to walk on the level,

00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:21.826 A:middle
and collect these flowers
like the one I just got.

00:05:21.826 --> 00:05:23.996 A:middle
I'm going to make my
way through the level,

00:05:23.996 --> 00:05:25.556 A:middle
and collect the flowers.

00:05:25.556 --> 00:05:27.556 A:middle
There's three on the
level, and I got the first.

00:05:28.196 --> 00:05:30.206 A:middle
You can optionally collect
these pearls along the way,

00:05:30.206 --> 00:05:32.446 A:middle
but I'm just going to
focus on the flowers.

00:05:32.446 --> 00:05:32.976 A:middle
I got two.

00:05:33.856 --> 00:05:36.646 A:middle
I know the third flower is on
the top, and is in the middle,

00:05:36.856 --> 00:05:37.746 A:middle
on the topo of the rock.

00:05:37.866 --> 00:05:43.066 A:middle
So I'm over here, so
here I'm going to take,

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:44.836 A:middle
I'm going to bring
up my game menu,

00:05:45.966 --> 00:05:47.056 A:middle
because I want to record this.

00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:48.486 A:middle
There is an obstacle
at the head,

00:05:48.776 --> 00:05:50.626 A:middle
and I've been practicing
this a lot this past week,

00:05:51.326 --> 00:05:53.396 A:middle
so I wanted to share this
with my friends to show them

00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:56.206 A:middle
that I can get through
this most of the time now.

00:05:56.206 --> 00:05:58.476 A:middle
So I'm going to start
my recording,

00:05:58.986 --> 00:06:01.076 A:middle
and here is the consent
prompt I mentioned.

00:05:58.986 --> 00:06:01.076 A:middle
and here is the consent
prompt I mentioned.

00:06:01.616 --> 00:06:02.906 A:middle
And I am going to
give permission.

00:06:04.626 --> 00:06:05.446 A:middle
So now I'm recording.

00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:08.136 A:middle
So notice the recording
indicator

00:06:08.136 --> 00:06:09.186 A:middle
at the top of the screen.

00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:12.916 A:middle
This lets me know that our
recording is taking place.

00:06:12.916 --> 00:06:14.176 A:middle
Okay, so I made it
through the flier.

00:06:14.756 --> 00:06:16.946 A:middle
So all I have to do now
is make my way to the end,

00:06:17.266 --> 00:06:20.576 A:middle
to do the final flower,
so I can finish the level,

00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:22.876 A:middle
and ultimately finish
the recording.

00:06:26.666 --> 00:06:27.456 A:middle
Okay so that's it.

00:06:28.296 --> 00:06:29.456 A:middle
I'm going to stop my recording.

00:06:30.436 --> 00:06:32.906 A:middle
Now, once I'm stopped, I have
the option where I can preview

00:06:32.906 --> 00:06:34.686 A:middle
or share the video I
just made, so I'm going

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:35.656 A:middle
to start off by previewing.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.196 A:middle
So we have a video playback,

00:06:38.196 --> 00:06:40.546 A:middle
and we have a timeline we can
scrub forward and backward.

00:06:41.386 --> 00:06:42.726 A:middle
I'm just going to
start playing it.

00:06:44.906 --> 00:06:47.146 A:middle
Notice here that recording
indicator is not included

00:06:47.146 --> 00:06:47.746 A:middle
in the recording.

00:06:47.746 --> 00:06:49.636 A:middle
I'm going to show you
how this was accomplished

00:06:49.636 --> 00:06:50.396 A:middle
in just a few minutes.

00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:54.196 A:middle
So I have a video, I'm happy
with how it turned out.

00:06:54.786 --> 00:06:55.666 A:middle
So now I want to share it.

00:06:55.666 --> 00:06:58.026 A:middle
So I'm going to go over
here and select share.

00:07:00.136 --> 00:07:02.066 A:middle
And now we are presented
with an AirDrop interface.

00:07:03.036 --> 00:07:04.056 A:middle
So I'm going to grab my phone.

00:07:08.536 --> 00:07:09.846 A:middle
I'm going to select my phone.

00:07:15.216 --> 00:07:19.186 A:middle
Anyway, when I do accept
the file on my phone

00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:21.886 A:middle
and the file is transferred,
once it's on my phone,

00:07:21.886 --> 00:07:24.676 A:middle
I do have the ability where
I can preview the video,

00:07:24.676 --> 00:07:27.606 A:middle
I can edit and trim the
video if I wanted to,

00:07:27.606 --> 00:07:29.976 A:middle
and finally I can share it to
my favorite social media sites.

00:07:36.326 --> 00:07:38.556 A:middle
So that was how ReplayKit
looks on Apple TV.

00:07:39.886 --> 00:07:43.016 A:middle
I now want to take a few moments
to call out four main points

00:07:43.016 --> 00:07:46.306 A:middle
from the demo, and then I'm
going to show you the code

00:07:46.306 --> 00:07:48.766 A:middle
that corresponds with each
of those points in a minute.

00:07:49.326 --> 00:07:50.276 A:middle
So first I'm going to begin.

00:07:50.276 --> 00:07:51.506 A:middle
I'm going to have
the end game menu

00:07:51.506 --> 00:07:52.596 A:middle
where I started my recording.

00:07:53.186 --> 00:07:56.766 A:middle
Then we have the gameplay where
we have the recording indicator

00:07:56.766 --> 00:08:01.316 A:middle
on screen, back to the game
menu to stop the recording,

00:07:56.766 --> 00:08:01.316 A:middle
on screen, back to the game
menu to stop the recording,

00:08:02.556 --> 00:08:04.646 A:middle
and finally when I stop the
recording I have the options

00:08:04.646 --> 00:08:07.136 A:middle
to preview or share
the recorded video.

00:08:08.206 --> 00:08:10.026 A:middle
So I'm going to walk
through each one of these,

00:08:10.026 --> 00:08:11.946 A:middle
and show you the code that
corresponds to each one.

00:08:12.606 --> 00:08:13.876 A:middle
We began or start our recording.

00:08:14.896 --> 00:08:16.996 A:middle
So when I press my
start recording button,

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.916 A:middle
first I'm going to grab
the shared instance

00:08:18.916 --> 00:08:20.086 A:middle
of the RPScreeningRecorder.

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:23.386 A:middle
And I simply am going to
tell it to start recording.

00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:24.946 A:middle
Now once I'm recording,

00:08:25.026 --> 00:08:26.666 A:middle
I'm going to present
the indicator view.

00:08:27.476 --> 00:08:31.256 A:middle
As I mentioned in the video,

00:08:31.256 --> 00:08:33.385 A:middle
the indicator was not
included in the recording.

00:08:33.775 --> 00:08:36.706 A:middle
This is because ReplayKit will
only record the application's

00:08:36.706 --> 00:08:37.405 A:middle
main window.

00:08:37.785 --> 00:08:40.756 A:middle
Therefore, I'm going to
create a new UI window.

00:08:41.466 --> 00:08:43.346 A:middle
And then the indicator view.

00:08:43.346 --> 00:08:45.876 A:middle
The indicator view will be
your responsibility to create.

00:08:45.876 --> 00:08:48.896 A:middle
This is because now you can make
it match the style of your game.

00:08:49.356 --> 00:08:50.376 A:middle
So we have an indicator view,

00:08:50.376 --> 00:08:52.886 A:middle
I'm going to instantiate an
instance of that indicator view,

00:08:53.186 --> 00:08:56.116 A:middle
and simply add it as a sub view
to that main window I created,

00:08:56.116 --> 00:08:58.106 A:middle
to the window I created above.

00:08:58.626 --> 00:09:00.276 A:middle
Now the indicator
view is on screen,

00:08:58.626 --> 00:09:00.276 A:middle
Now the indicator
view is on screen,

00:09:01.186 --> 00:09:02.166 A:middle
and we know we're recording.

00:09:02.356 --> 00:09:06.886 A:middle
When we are done recording, we
press the stop record button.

00:09:07.316 --> 00:09:09.166 A:middle
Again, I'm going to
grab the shared instance

00:09:09.166 --> 00:09:10.346 A:middle
of the RPScreenRecorder.

00:09:11.616 --> 00:09:14.166 A:middle
Now notice we return the
preview view controller,

00:09:14.166 --> 00:09:17.216 A:middle
which is the RPPreviewController
class I mentioned earlier.

00:09:17.906 --> 00:09:20.116 A:middle
I'm going to hide
my indicator view.

00:09:20.336 --> 00:09:23.156 A:middle
And here it's important that
we hold onto a reference

00:09:23.156 --> 00:09:26.196 A:middle
of the preview view controller,
because we are going to use it

00:09:26.196 --> 00:09:28.736 A:middle
to present in the next
step for previewing

00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:29.846 A:middle
and sharing the video.

00:09:30.976 --> 00:09:34.996 A:middle
Finally I'm going
to set the delegate.

00:09:34.996 --> 00:09:37.046 A:middle
So we saw that we have
one preview controller,

00:09:37.046 --> 00:09:38.116 A:middle
but we have two interfaces,

00:09:38.116 --> 00:09:39.756 A:middle
one for previewing,
and one for sharing.

00:09:40.866 --> 00:09:43.626 A:middle
So at Apple TV, we have
introduced a new mode property.

00:09:44.426 --> 00:09:47.586 A:middle
When we want a preview, we
simply set the mode to preview,

00:09:47.586 --> 00:09:51.136 A:middle
and then present
the view controller.

00:09:51.206 --> 00:09:54.486 A:middle
Similarly, to share, we
have the mode property.

00:09:54.486 --> 00:09:58.306 A:middle
We are going to set the
mode to share, and again,

00:09:58.306 --> 00:09:59.266 A:middle
present the view controller.

00:09:59.976 --> 00:10:02.116 A:middle
Now we will be presented
with the AirDrop interface.

00:09:59.976 --> 00:10:02.116 A:middle
Now we will be presented
with the AirDrop interface.

00:10:03.956 --> 00:10:07.546 A:middle
In both cases, when the user
is done with each interface,

00:10:07.696 --> 00:10:09.526 A:middle
we have a delegate method
that is going to be called.

00:10:10.086 --> 00:10:11.536 A:middle
Preview Controller did finish.

00:10:12.736 --> 00:10:14.596 A:middle
It's important when this
is called that you just--

00:10:15.086 --> 00:10:16.866 A:middle
that you dismiss the
preview controller,

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.906 A:middle
since your app was
responsible for presenting it.

00:10:20.526 --> 00:10:24.166 A:middle
Finally, when we are done
with the recording and we know

00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:26.706 A:middle
that we no longer need
it, it's good practice

00:10:26.756 --> 00:10:27.866 A:middle
to discard that recording.

00:10:28.456 --> 00:10:31.606 A:middle
Now ReplayKit will automatically
discard the previous recording

00:10:31.606 --> 00:10:32.906 A:middle
when a new recording begins.

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:36.146 A:middle
This is because one recording
is allowed at a time per app.

00:10:37.406 --> 00:10:39.416 A:middle
You could also explicitly
discard the recording

00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:41.806 A:middle
when you know that the preview
will no longer be available.

00:10:42.326 --> 00:10:43.926 A:middle
For example, maybe at
the end of a level,

00:10:43.926 --> 00:10:45.946 A:middle
there could be no
more opportunity

00:10:45.946 --> 00:10:46.796 A:middle
to present a preview.

00:10:47.296 --> 00:10:49.146 A:middle
So now you can explicitly
discard it

00:10:49.146 --> 00:10:52.056 A:middle
by calling RPScreenRecorder's
discard recording method.

00:10:54.266 --> 00:10:57.076 A:middle
Through these last few slides,
I've shown you the small amount

00:10:57.076 --> 00:10:58.146 A:middle
of code that is required

00:10:58.196 --> 00:11:00.956 A:middle
to bring these features
to your tvOS games.

00:10:58.196 --> 00:11:00.956 A:middle
to bring these features
to your tvOS games.

00:11:01.896 --> 00:11:04.626 A:middle
I encourage you all to add
ReplayKit to your tvOS apps,

00:11:05.016 --> 00:11:07.546 A:middle
and also to your iOS apps, if
you have not done so already.

00:11:08.206 --> 00:11:11.766 A:middle
So now, let me take a minute

00:11:11.766 --> 00:11:13.396 A:middle
to summarize ReplayKit
and Apple TV.

00:11:14.426 --> 00:11:15.876 A:middle
Now, with ReplayKit
and Apple TV,

00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:18.626 A:middle
you can record your app
audio and video content.

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:23.366 A:middle
Under Apple TV, the microphone
is reserved by the system,

00:11:23.896 --> 00:11:27.126 A:middle
so you cannot provide voice
commentary on the platform.

00:11:27.816 --> 00:11:30.286 A:middle
But you can allow users
to preview their videos,

00:11:30.286 --> 00:11:32.586 A:middle
and they can share their videos
directly from their games.

00:11:34.236 --> 00:11:36.866 A:middle
As you saw, we have
a very simple API.

00:11:37.186 --> 00:11:40.006 A:middle
In fact, it's the same
API that we offer for iOS.

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:43.106 A:middle
All these features
for Apple TV are going

00:11:43.106 --> 00:11:45.336 A:middle
to be available new in tvOS 10.

00:11:46.366 --> 00:11:48.626 A:middle
So that was ReplayKit
and Apple TV.

00:11:49.416 --> 00:11:52.216 A:middle
So now it's time to move on to
the second of our new features,

00:11:52.216 --> 00:11:54.426 A:middle
which I personally am
very excited about.

00:11:55.066 --> 00:11:57.966 A:middle
So, at this time, please welcome
Edwin Iskandar up to the stage.

00:11:58.516 --> 00:12:02.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:11:58.516 --> 00:12:02.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:03.116 --> 00:12:04.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Alright, thanks guys.

00:12:04.966 --> 00:12:06.616 A:middle
Hey, how is everyone doing?

00:12:06.616 --> 00:12:07.786 A:middle
My name is Edwin Iskandar.

00:12:07.846 --> 00:12:08.896 A:middle
I am a Software Engineer

00:12:09.016 --> 00:12:10.816 A:middle
on the Game Technologies
Team here at Apple.

00:12:11.406 --> 00:12:14.156 A:middle
And like Ben, I'm super
excited to talk to you guys

00:12:14.156 --> 00:12:16.676 A:middle
about our next feature,
Live Broadcast.

00:12:17.086 --> 00:12:20.656 A:middle
So with Live Broadcast,
players will be able

00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:23.446 A:middle
to broadcast gameplay to
third party streaming services

00:12:23.736 --> 00:12:26.556 A:middle
directly from their
iOS or tvOS device.

00:12:27.426 --> 00:12:29.726 A:middle
So this is really exciting,
because this is the first time

00:12:29.726 --> 00:12:32.496 A:middle
that this will be possible
without any additional hardware

00:12:32.956 --> 00:12:36.636 A:middle
or third party SDKs, will
also be allowing your users

00:12:36.636 --> 00:12:38.926 A:middle
to take advantage of their
device's powerful Face Time

00:12:38.926 --> 00:12:42.256 A:middle
camera and microphone to
provide rich commentary all

00:12:42.256 --> 00:12:42.876 A:middle
in real-time.

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:46.436 A:middle
And finally, we are going to
do this all securely and ensure

00:12:46.436 --> 00:12:49.676 A:middle
that all audio and video data
is only accessible to the system

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:51.296 A:middle
and the broadcast service.

00:12:51.736 --> 00:12:55.026 A:middle
Alright, so to illustrate how
this works, we've been working

00:12:55.026 --> 00:12:57.646 A:middle
with flair games to implement
the broadcast feature,

00:12:57.676 --> 00:12:59.756 A:middle
and the flagship
game, Olympus Rising.

00:13:00.226 --> 00:13:01.436 A:middle
So it's a really awesome game.

00:13:01.436 --> 00:13:03.246 A:middle
It's available in
the app store today.

00:13:03.346 --> 00:13:05.426 A:middle
And it has this unique
blend of strategy,

00:13:05.656 --> 00:13:07.016 A:middle
RPG and action elements.

00:13:07.956 --> 00:13:10.406 A:middle
Okay, now that we have a
game to broadcast from,

00:13:10.726 --> 00:13:12.496 A:middle
we also need somewhere
to broadcast to.

00:13:13.856 --> 00:13:17.086 A:middle
So we've also been working with
Mob Crush, a broadcast service

00:13:17.086 --> 00:13:18.686 A:middle
that specializes
in mobile games.

00:13:19.896 --> 00:13:21.206 A:middle
Alright, so now that
we have a game

00:13:21.296 --> 00:13:22.956 A:middle
and a service, we're
ready to roll.

00:13:23.276 --> 00:13:24.246 A:middle
So let's see this in action.

00:13:25.736 --> 00:13:27.216 A:middle
Alright so in Olympus Rising,

00:13:27.216 --> 00:13:29.696 A:middle
the Flair developers have
implemented an end game button

00:13:29.696 --> 00:13:30.866 A:middle
to start broadcasting.

00:13:31.086 --> 00:13:33.786 A:middle
To initiate a broadcast,
the user taps this button,

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:36.636 A:middle
and are pesented with
broadcast services

00:13:36.636 --> 00:13:38.486 A:middle
that they have pre-installed
on their device.

00:13:38.946 --> 00:13:40.176 A:middle
In this particular example,

00:13:40.176 --> 00:13:41.816 A:middle
the user has installed
the Mob Crush app,

00:13:42.296 --> 00:13:43.306 A:middle
so it appears on this list.

00:13:43.346 --> 00:13:47.516 A:middle
So at this point, the user
taps on the Mob Crush icon,

00:13:47.936 --> 00:13:49.506 A:middle
and they are presented
with Mob Crush's UI

00:13:49.506 --> 00:13:50.786 A:middle
to set up the broadcast.

00:13:52.096 --> 00:13:55.146 A:middle
The user then goes ahead and
adds a title for the broadcast,

00:13:56.146 --> 00:13:57.916 A:middle
and once they're done,
they simply press

00:13:57.916 --> 00:14:01.646 A:middle
on the start broadcast button,
which returns to the game,

00:13:57.916 --> 00:14:01.646 A:middle
on the start broadcast button,
which returns to the game,

00:14:01.916 --> 00:14:03.226 A:middle
which then presents a countdown,

00:14:03.596 --> 00:14:06.396 A:middle
so that the player can get
ready, and finally, go live.

00:14:06.866 --> 00:14:10.746 A:middle
And now that they're live,
and the user is playing,

00:14:10.746 --> 00:14:13.426 A:middle
video and audio data is streamed
to the broadcast service.

00:14:13.796 --> 00:14:16.456 A:middle
Spectators all around the world
can now launch the Mob Crush app

00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:19.836 A:middle
from their device, and watch
the gameplay in near real time.

00:14:20.566 --> 00:14:21.576 A:middle
Within the Mob Crush app,

00:14:21.576 --> 00:14:24.116 A:middle
spectators can also discuss
the gameplay as they watch.

00:14:24.436 --> 00:14:27.806 A:middle
And even cooler, broadcasters
can even be instantly notified

00:14:28.146 --> 00:14:29.696 A:middle
when this happens while
playing their game.

00:14:30.846 --> 00:14:32.026 A:middle
So it's just like in sports,

00:14:32.116 --> 00:14:33.386 A:middle
there is something
really special

00:14:33.386 --> 00:14:34.956 A:middle
about watching an event live.

00:14:35.786 --> 00:14:38.176 A:middle
Now, this will be
possible natively with iOS

00:14:38.476 --> 00:14:39.976 A:middle
and tvOS games as well.

00:14:44.056 --> 00:14:45.746 A:middle
Alright so now that we've
seen the entire flow,

00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:48.266 A:middle
as a game developer, you're
probably wondering what it takes

00:14:48.266 --> 00:14:49.736 A:middle
to implement this
feature in your games?

00:14:49.936 --> 00:14:52.636 A:middle
Here is the player
flow broken down.

00:14:53.186 --> 00:14:55.026 A:middle
As you can see, there
are many steps.

00:14:55.376 --> 00:14:58.786 A:middle
Initiating the broadcast,
selecting a broadcast service,

00:14:59.386 --> 00:15:03.146 A:middle
setting up the broadcast,
starting

00:14:59.386 --> 00:15:03.146 A:middle
setting up the broadcast,
starting

00:15:03.146 --> 00:15:06.016 A:middle
and stopping the broadcast,
indicating a broadcast is

00:15:06.016 --> 00:15:08.966 A:middle
in progress, and also uploading
that video and audio data

00:15:08.966 --> 00:15:10.016 A:middle
to the back-end servers.

00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:12.586 A:middle
So this might look a little
bit daunting at first,

00:15:12.886 --> 00:15:15.246 A:middle
but the good news for
game developers is three

00:15:15.246 --> 00:15:16.856 A:middle
of these steps are
handled by ReplayKit

00:15:17.126 --> 00:15:19.106 A:middle
and the broadcast service.

00:15:24.646 --> 00:15:26.906 A:middle
So let's take a look at the
code for each of these steps.

00:15:27.286 --> 00:15:29.676 A:middle
So to initiate a
broadcast programmatically,

00:15:30.046 --> 00:15:32.416 A:middle
we use a new class
called RPBroadcastActivity

00:15:32.416 --> 00:15:34.506 A:middle
ViewController, and
call its load method

00:15:34.506 --> 00:15:35.446 A:middle
to get an instance of it.

00:15:36.266 --> 00:15:39.386 A:middle
We then simply present it as you
would any UI view controller,

00:15:40.116 --> 00:15:41.646 A:middle
which will then present
the user with a list

00:15:41.646 --> 00:15:43.926 A:middle
of broadcast services, and
ultimately allow the user

00:15:44.146 --> 00:15:45.166 A:middle
to set up the broadcast.

00:15:46.306 --> 00:15:47.566 A:middle
Just before we do that, though,

00:15:47.646 --> 00:15:49.566 A:middle
we also set the
ActivityViewController's

00:15:49.706 --> 00:15:50.376 A:middle
delegate method.

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:53.596 A:middle
Because we want to be notified
when the setup is complete.

00:15:55.436 --> 00:15:57.536 A:middle
At this point, the user
can select the service

00:15:57.536 --> 00:15:59.916 A:middle
to broadcast to, sets
up the broadcast,

00:16:00.096 --> 00:16:01.606 A:middle
and once we you done setting up,

00:16:02.176 --> 00:16:04.346 A:middle
the activity view controller's
delegate method is fired,

00:16:05.286 --> 00:16:07.376 A:middle
and this delegate method
is supplied an incidence

00:16:07.376 --> 00:16:10.206 A:middle
of another new class,
RPBroadcastController,

00:16:10.606 --> 00:16:12.316 A:middle
which allows us to
start a broadcast.

00:16:12.996 --> 00:16:15.006 A:middle
But before we do that,
though, we also want

00:16:15.006 --> 00:16:17.506 A:middle
to dismiss the
ActivityViewController,

00:16:17.886 --> 00:16:19.506 A:middle
since we are the ones
that presented it.

00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:21.816 A:middle
Start our in game
countdown timer,

00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:24.246 A:middle
and when the countdown
timer ends,

00:16:24.856 --> 00:16:28.256 A:middle
we finally start the broadcast
by calling Start Broadcast

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:32.266 A:middle
on the new RPBroadcastController
instance, that was passed in.

00:16:32.696 --> 00:16:35.156 A:middle
And now we are live.

00:16:35.576 --> 00:16:36.946 A:middle
And since we're live
broadcasting,

00:16:37.266 --> 00:16:39.196 A:middle
we need to clearly
indicate this to the user.

00:16:39.896 --> 00:16:41.696 A:middle
So Olympus Rising
does this very well

00:16:42.066 --> 00:16:43.566 A:middle
by animating the
broadcast button.

00:16:44.146 --> 00:16:46.666 A:middle
Since the game has
fairly complex controls,

00:16:46.666 --> 00:16:48.996 A:middle
they're reusing the button
UI to also indicate an

00:16:48.996 --> 00:16:50.206 A:middle
in progress broadcast,

00:16:50.606 --> 00:16:52.276 A:middle
maximizing the available
screen space.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:55.946 A:middle
Something to note is that the
indicator is strictly required

00:16:55.946 --> 00:16:58.966 A:middle
during broadcasting and will
be enforced during app review

00:17:00.296 --> 00:17:01.596 A:middle
before you add this
to your games.

00:17:01.596 --> 00:17:05.326 A:middle
So programmatically check
if broadcast is in progress,

00:17:05.496 --> 00:17:07.506 A:middle
simply query is broadcasting
prompt

00:17:07.506 --> 00:17:08.636 A:middle
of the broadcast controller.

00:17:09.435 --> 00:17:11.965 A:middle
You can use the value of
this property to start

00:17:12.326 --> 00:17:14.776 A:middle
or stop animating
your indicator UI.

00:17:16.576 --> 00:17:18.695 A:middle
To allow users to
finish broadcasting,

00:17:18.816 --> 00:17:21.215 A:middle
the Flair developers have
implemented a fly out UI

00:17:21.215 --> 00:17:23.886 A:middle
that reveals a sub menu
which includes a stop button.

00:17:24.736 --> 00:17:26.386 A:middle
When the player presses
on the stop button,

00:17:27.136 --> 00:17:30.366 A:middle
we simply call finish
broadcast on the controller.

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:33.666 A:middle
When broadcasting is
finished, we update our UI.

00:17:33.666 --> 00:17:36.846 A:middle
Alright, now that we
covered the basic flow,

00:17:36.996 --> 00:17:39.696 A:middle
let's look at a few more
details, like error handling.

00:17:41.656 --> 00:17:43.956 A:middle
So since there are a lot of
moving parts to this feature,

00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:45.726 A:middle
it's possible that
things could go wrong.

00:17:45.726 --> 00:17:47.936 A:middle
So it is important to
handle this gracefully.

00:17:48.546 --> 00:17:51.586 A:middle
And so let's take a look at how
we do this during a broadcast.

00:17:52.716 --> 00:17:54.586 A:middle
To handle errors,
simply set the delegate

00:17:54.586 --> 00:17:55.786 A:middle
to the broadcast controller.

00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:59.736 A:middle
Once set, your delegate
will now have its did finish

00:17:59.736 --> 00:18:03.926 A:middle
with error method called
and when this is triggered,

00:17:59.736 --> 00:18:03.926 A:middle
with error method called
and when this is triggered,

00:18:03.926 --> 00:18:05.496 A:middle
you should let the
user know about it

00:18:05.596 --> 00:18:06.976 A:middle
and update any necessary UI.

00:18:07.626 --> 00:18:10.816 A:middle
So now another detail
to consider is

00:18:10.816 --> 00:18:12.246 A:middle
when the user backgrounds
the app,

00:18:12.246 --> 00:18:14.606 A:middle
or the app is interrupted
during a broadcast,

00:18:14.936 --> 00:18:16.546 A:middle
like when receiving a
phone call, or example.

00:18:16.586 --> 00:18:19.616 A:middle
So when the application
goes to the background,

00:18:19.616 --> 00:18:21.996 A:middle
ReplayKit will automatically
pause the broadcast.

00:18:21.996 --> 00:18:24.286 A:middle
So in this particular example,

00:18:24.286 --> 00:18:26.476 A:middle
when the application is
reactivated and comes back

00:18:26.476 --> 00:18:29.256 A:middle
to the foreground, we prompt
the user and ask if they would

00:18:29.256 --> 00:18:30.516 A:middle
like to resume the broadcast.

00:18:30.676 --> 00:18:33.506 A:middle
If the user wants
to resume, call,

00:18:33.506 --> 00:18:35.856 A:middle
the resume broadcast
method, if they don't,

00:18:36.086 --> 00:18:38.216 A:middle
simply call the finish
broadcast method.

00:18:38.466 --> 00:18:40.456 A:middle
And that's it.

00:18:40.756 --> 00:18:43.186 A:middle
For the entire flow, the game
developer needs to only interact

00:18:43.186 --> 00:18:45.196 A:middle
with two classes,
and its delegates.

00:18:45.566 --> 00:18:47.466 A:middle
RPBroadcastActivity
ViewController,

00:18:47.916 --> 00:18:50.276 A:middle
to present broadcast services,
and allow users to set

00:18:50.276 --> 00:18:53.796 A:middle
up a broadcast, and
RPBroadcastController to start,

00:18:53.886 --> 00:18:56.086 A:middle
pause, resume and
finish a broadcast.

00:18:57.156 --> 00:18:59.866 A:middle
As you can see, it couldn't
be easier to add broadcasting

00:18:59.866 --> 00:19:01.796 A:middle
into your games, and
I urge you to do so,

00:18:59.866 --> 00:19:01.796 A:middle
into your games, and
I urge you to do so,

00:19:01.796 --> 00:19:03.456 A:middle
because the benefits are huge.

00:19:03.716 --> 00:19:05.856 A:middle
There is really no better
way to spread the word,

00:19:06.466 --> 00:19:07.986 A:middle
increase player engagement

00:19:08.256 --> 00:19:10.536 A:middle
and even build a
community around your games.

00:19:10.856 --> 00:19:14.636 A:middle
So that covers game
implementation,

00:19:14.806 --> 00:19:16.436 A:middle
but what about the
broadcast services

00:19:16.536 --> 00:19:18.716 A:middle
that players are streaming
to, like Mob Crush?

00:19:18.936 --> 00:19:21.466 A:middle
Let's take a moment
to talk briefly

00:19:21.466 --> 00:19:23.466 A:middle
about what those services
are responsible for.

00:19:24.186 --> 00:19:25.966 A:middle
So for all the game
developers in the audience,

00:19:26.106 --> 00:19:28.796 A:middle
or watching online, I just
want to make it extra clear

00:19:28.966 --> 00:19:29.836 A:middle
that the topics discussed

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:32.386 A:middle
in the next section are
not your responsibility

00:19:32.386 --> 00:19:35.876 A:middle
to implement in your games.

00:19:35.876 --> 00:19:37.376 A:middle
So let's go back to
that flow diagram.

00:19:37.996 --> 00:19:39.476 A:middle
We've seen that the
gamer is responsible

00:19:39.476 --> 00:19:42.676 A:middle
for initiating the
broadcast, and controlling

00:19:42.676 --> 00:19:44.216 A:middle
when to start and
stop a broadcast.

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:45.796 A:middle
We have also seen that the UI

00:19:46.046 --> 00:19:47.846 A:middle
for broadcast selection
is taken care

00:19:47.846 --> 00:19:50.366 A:middle
of by ReplayKit's
BroadcastActivityViewController.

00:19:51.306 --> 00:19:53.136 A:middle
So this leaves us with
two remaining tasks.

00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:57.626 A:middle
Setting up the broadcast, and
uploading video and audio data

00:19:57.626 --> 00:19:58.616 A:middle
to the back-up servers.

00:19:59.096 --> 00:20:02.586 A:middle
So to allow broadcast services
to accomplish these steps,

00:19:59.096 --> 00:20:02.586 A:middle
So to allow broadcast services
to accomplish these steps,

00:20:02.586 --> 00:20:03.746 A:middle
we're introducing a new pair

00:20:03.746 --> 00:20:05.976 A:middle
of app extensions
specifically for this feature.

00:20:07.296 --> 00:20:10.596 A:middle
A UI extension, to allow the
user to set up a broadcast,

00:20:11.806 --> 00:20:13.686 A:middle
and a non-UI extension
for processing

00:20:13.876 --> 00:20:16.606 A:middle
and uploading the
audio and video data.

00:20:18.026 --> 00:20:20.306 A:middle
For those of you
unfamiliar with extensions,

00:20:20.606 --> 00:20:23.896 A:middle
they're target embedded in your
parent application and are a way

00:20:24.106 --> 00:20:26.446 A:middle
to extend your app so that
you can execute alongside

00:20:26.446 --> 00:20:26.986 A:middle
other apps.

00:20:27.876 --> 00:20:30.456 A:middle
They run in a separate
process from your parent app,

00:20:30.886 --> 00:20:32.916 A:middle
but can share data with
your parent application,

00:20:33.016 --> 00:20:34.386 A:middle
which can be handy
or sharing things

00:20:34.386 --> 00:20:35.956 A:middle
like authentication
data, for example.

00:20:37.156 --> 00:20:38.836 A:middle
So one thing to keep
in mind, though,

00:20:39.206 --> 00:20:40.346 A:middle
is that extensions are limited

00:20:40.346 --> 00:20:42.126 A:middle
in resources compared
to applications.

00:20:42.126 --> 00:20:45.326 A:middle
So try to refrain from doing
resource intensive tasks

00:20:45.326 --> 00:20:46.246 A:middle
within them.

00:20:47.196 --> 00:20:49.086 A:middle
We made it incredibly
easy to set

00:20:49.086 --> 00:20:50.916 A:middle
up these extensions
via an exotemplate.

00:20:51.676 --> 00:20:55.056 A:middle
These are available as new
targets for both iOS and tvOS.

00:20:56.326 --> 00:20:57.776 A:middle
If created from this template,

00:20:57.776 --> 00:21:00.206 A:middle
the extensions will be
pre-configured so they will show

00:20:57.776 --> 00:21:00.206 A:middle
the extensions will be
pre-configured so they will show

00:21:00.206 --> 00:21:02.316 A:middle
up in the broadcast
activity control list.

00:21:03.986 --> 00:21:06.516 A:middle
So let's take a look at
the two new extensions

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.136 A:middle
that a broadcast service
needs to implement,

00:21:08.696 --> 00:21:10.726 A:middle
starting with the
broadcast UI extension.

00:21:12.196 --> 00:21:14.876 A:middle
UI extension has a few
key responsibilities,

00:21:15.106 --> 00:21:17.326 A:middle
first it's responsible for
authenticating the user,

00:21:17.656 --> 00:21:19.826 A:middle
and providing sign up if the
user is not yet registered.

00:21:20.686 --> 00:21:23.176 A:middle
Ideally, this should all be
done within the extension

00:21:23.176 --> 00:21:25.326 A:middle
so that the user's
experience is not interrupted.

00:21:25.956 --> 00:21:28.056 A:middle
But is also perfectly
acceptable to link

00:21:28.056 --> 00:21:31.106 A:middle
up to the parent application
as long as the user has a way

00:21:31.106 --> 00:21:34.376 A:middle
to get back to the game.

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:36.066 A:middle
So, during sign up
it is also required

00:21:36.066 --> 00:21:37.606 A:middle
that the user be shown
terms and conditions

00:21:37.606 --> 00:21:40.756 A:middle
for using the service, and be
provided the ability to accept

00:21:40.956 --> 00:21:42.366 A:middle
or decline those
terms and conditions.

00:21:43.766 --> 00:21:46.806 A:middle
So as we saw earlier, UI
extension is also responsible

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.646 A:middle
for allowing the user to
set up their broadcasts,

00:21:48.646 --> 00:21:52.776 A:middle
like adding a title to it,
and it can also allow the user

00:21:52.906 --> 00:21:54.556 A:middle
to notify others
that broadcasting is

00:21:54.556 --> 00:21:56.416 A:middle
about to begin via social media.

00:21:58.066 --> 00:22:00.616 A:middle
Finally, its final
responsibility is notifying

00:21:58.066 --> 00:22:00.616 A:middle
Finally, its final
responsibility is notifying

00:22:00.616 --> 00:22:02.626 A:middle
ReplayKit, and ultimately
the game

00:22:03.126 --> 00:22:04.736 A:middle
that broadcast set
up is complete.

00:22:04.986 --> 00:22:09.396 A:middle
So now that we looked at the
UI extension, let's switch

00:22:09.396 --> 00:22:10.586 A:middle
over to the upload extension.

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:14.166 A:middle
It is responsible for
receiving and processing video

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:17.036 A:middle
and audio data, and
uploading that data

00:22:17.086 --> 00:22:18.036 A:middle
to the back-end servers.

00:22:18.756 --> 00:22:21.706 A:middle
So we are aware there are
many different implementations

00:22:21.706 --> 00:22:24.416 A:middle
of data processing and
uploading to live streaming.

00:22:24.976 --> 00:22:27.566 A:middle
So I won't be getting into any
specific implementations during

00:22:27.566 --> 00:22:28.106 A:middle
this session.

00:22:28.546 --> 00:22:32.386 A:middle
Instead, if you are a broadcast
service, please get in touch

00:22:32.556 --> 00:22:34.346 A:middle
with us, so we can
work directly with you.

00:22:34.906 --> 00:22:36.386 A:middle
This way we can implement
a solution

00:22:36.446 --> 00:22:38.756 A:middle
that delivers the best
experience to our customers.

00:22:41.046 --> 00:22:43.806 A:middle
So going back to our flow
diagram, now we have looked

00:22:43.806 --> 00:22:46.086 A:middle
at the broadcast
set up and upload.

00:22:46.246 --> 00:22:49.576 A:middle
We have gone through the
entire broadcast slow.

00:22:50.506 --> 00:22:52.786 A:middle
And we've clearly broken
down the responsibilities

00:22:52.786 --> 00:22:56.666 A:middle
of the game, ReplayKit
and the broadcast service,

00:22:57.096 --> 00:22:59.566 A:middle
and that was live broadcasting.

00:23:00.246 --> 00:23:02.666 A:middle
We really feel this is
a game changing feature

00:23:03.216 --> 00:23:05.026 A:middle
that you players
are going to love,

00:23:05.296 --> 00:23:07.596 A:middle
and for developers it is
going to introduce a new way

00:23:07.596 --> 00:23:10.586 A:middle
for your fans to experience your
games, not only by playing them,

00:23:10.946 --> 00:23:12.006 A:middle
but by watching them as well.

00:23:14.386 --> 00:23:16.086 A:middle
So before we go, I'd like to end

00:23:16.086 --> 00:23:17.916 A:middle
with a few new enhancements
we made to the API

00:23:18.536 --> 00:23:20.146 A:middle
around commentary for iOS.

00:23:20.276 --> 00:23:21.956 A:middle
Namely, support for the
front-facing camera,

00:23:22.516 --> 00:23:24.666 A:middle
and also a new capability
for the microphone.

00:23:26.006 --> 00:23:28.586 A:middle
So first up, we've added
Face Time camera support,

00:23:28.796 --> 00:23:30.866 A:middle
making it incredibly convenient
for you to add picture

00:23:30.866 --> 00:23:32.916 A:middle
in picture video
commentary to your games.

00:23:33.806 --> 00:23:36.406 A:middle
Player reaction is
priceless, and always adds

00:23:36.406 --> 00:23:38.876 A:middle
that special flavor to
recordings and broadcasts.

00:23:39.156 --> 00:23:41.266 A:middle
So to enable this
in Olympus Rising,

00:23:41.346 --> 00:23:43.776 A:middle
the Flair developers have added
a button to toggle the camera

00:23:43.776 --> 00:23:44.596 A:middle
in their fly out menu.

00:23:45.386 --> 00:23:48.106 A:middle
Pressing this button enables
the camera displaying a preview

00:23:48.106 --> 00:23:48.956 A:middle
at the top left.

00:23:50.566 --> 00:23:53.376 A:middle
So let's look at the API
they used to achieve this.

00:23:54.736 --> 00:23:55.986 A:middle
To toggle the camera on,

00:23:55.986 --> 00:23:58.446 A:middle
we simply set the
IsCameraEnabled property to true

00:23:58.446 --> 00:24:01.736 A:middle
on RPScreenRecorder, this
turns on the camera hardware,

00:23:58.446 --> 00:24:01.736 A:middle
on RPScreenRecorder, this
turns on the camera hardware,

00:24:02.236 --> 00:24:05.186 A:middle
and populates a new
RPScreenRecorder called

00:24:05.216 --> 00:24:07.806 A:middle
CameraPreviewView, which
is a subclass of UI view.

00:24:08.096 --> 00:24:11.766 A:middle
Since it is UI view, you can
simply add it as a sub view

00:24:11.766 --> 00:24:14.146 A:middle
to your game view, and
even freely position it

00:24:14.146 --> 00:24:16.266 A:middle
so that it does not
obstruct gameplay.

00:24:16.706 --> 00:24:19.956 A:middle
You can even attach a Adjust
or Recognize It to it,

00:24:19.956 --> 00:24:21.996 A:middle
and allows you to position
it manually if you wanted.

00:24:23.306 --> 00:24:24.826 A:middle
So looking at the code here,

00:24:25.176 --> 00:24:27.256 A:middle
we're simply setting the
IsCameraEnabled property

00:24:27.256 --> 00:24:29.036 A:middle
to True during recording
of broadcast.

00:24:29.526 --> 00:24:36.796 A:middle
Then we get a CameraPreviewView
instance, then set its geometry

00:24:36.846 --> 00:24:39.806 A:middle
to position it, and
then simply add it

00:24:39.806 --> 00:24:41.326 A:middle
as a sub view to your game view.

00:24:43.446 --> 00:24:45.916 A:middle
So now that we have video
commentary, we also need

00:24:45.916 --> 00:24:46.906 A:middle
to pair that with audio.

00:24:47.796 --> 00:24:50.876 A:middle
So microphone recording was
included last year in iOS 9,

00:24:51.416 --> 00:24:52.726 A:middle
but now we are including
the ability

00:24:52.726 --> 00:24:54.676 A:middle
to mute it during
recordings as well.

00:24:55.266 --> 00:24:57.496 A:middle
So we all know broadcasters
always have something

00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:58.376 A:middle
interesting to say,

00:24:58.706 --> 00:25:00.546 A:middle
but sometimes even
they need a break.

00:24:58.706 --> 00:25:00.546 A:middle
but sometimes even
they need a break.

00:25:01.866 --> 00:25:03.516 A:middle
So Olympus Rising
makes this really easy

00:25:03.516 --> 00:25:05.936 A:middle
by including a microphone
toggle in their fly out menu.

00:25:07.406 --> 00:25:08.576 A:middle
Implementing the action

00:25:08.636 --> 00:25:10.716 A:middle
to microphone toggle
couldn't be simpler.

00:25:10.966 --> 00:25:13.436 A:middle
The existing IsMicrophoneEnabled
property

00:25:13.706 --> 00:25:16.576 A:middle
on RPScreenRecorder can
be set to true if you want

00:25:16.576 --> 00:25:19.786 A:middle
to enable the microphone, and
false when you want to mute it.

00:25:20.906 --> 00:25:23.236 A:middle
Again this can all be
done during a broadcast

00:25:23.306 --> 00:25:23.966 A:middle
or recording session.

00:25:27.516 --> 00:25:28.966 A:middle
Alright so that concludes
our session,

00:25:29.056 --> 00:25:30.496 A:middle
and I really hope
you enjoyed it.

00:25:30.966 --> 00:25:33.636 A:middle
With the powerful new broadcast
feature and now support

00:25:33.686 --> 00:25:36.006 A:middle
for Apple TV, we
can't wait to play

00:25:36.416 --> 00:25:40.806 A:middle
and watch your games live
on both iOS and tvOS.

00:25:41.326 --> 00:25:44.356 A:middle
