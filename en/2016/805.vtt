[ Applause ]

00:00:29.056 --> 00:00:29.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:30.476 A:middle
Wow it's loud.

00:00:30.986 --> 00:00:32.136 A:middle
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:32.516 --> 00:00:33.786 A:middle
We're really excited to be here.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.166 A:middle
My name is Ryan Olshavsky.

00:00:36.256 --> 00:00:38.326 A:middle
And with me down
there is Jonathan Cho.

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:41.056 A:middle
We're designers on an
iWork team at Apple

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:44.076 A:middle
where we make the Numbers,
Pages, and Keynote apps

00:00:44.386 --> 00:00:46.356 A:middle
for Mac, iOS, and iCloud.

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:51.506 A:middle
Jon and I have been
designing software interfaces

00:00:51.826 --> 00:00:54.546 A:middle
for quite a while both
at Apple and elsewhere.

00:00:54.856 --> 00:00:57.126 A:middle
And if there's one thing
that we've learned on all

00:00:57.126 --> 00:01:02.636 A:middle
of our years of experience, it's
that good design is not easy.

00:00:57.126 --> 00:01:02.636 A:middle
of our years of experience, it's
that good design is not easy.

00:01:03.476 --> 00:01:05.946 A:middle
And I know that sounds like
something a designer would say

00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:08.136 A:middle
because it's good
for our job security

00:01:08.196 --> 00:01:09.326 A:middle
if everybody believes this.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:14.066 A:middle
And maybe some of you have seen
what designers do and thought,

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.226 A:middle
well that doesn't look too hard.

00:01:15.986 --> 00:01:20.266 A:middle
And you're right a lot of times
great design can see obvious

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:21.486 A:middle
or effortless.

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:25.386 A:middle
But what makes design difficult
are the questions you have

00:01:25.386 --> 00:01:26.626 A:middle
to answer to do it well.

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:29.936 A:middle
Questions like, what
are we making?

00:01:31.256 --> 00:01:32.116 A:middle
Who is it for?

00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:34.286 A:middle
Does it actually work?

00:01:34.806 --> 00:01:36.396 A:middle
And did we get it right?

00:01:38.936 --> 00:01:42.006 A:middle
These questions do not
have obvious answers.

00:01:42.226 --> 00:01:44.486 A:middle
And they're always
challenging even

00:01:44.486 --> 00:01:46.126 A:middle
for the most experienced
designers.

00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:49.576 A:middle
And if you're a solo developer,
or you're the only designer

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:52.466 A:middle
on your team, or if you just
never really designed anything

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:54.956 A:middle
before, trying to answer
these questions can be a

00:01:54.956 --> 00:01:55.926 A:middle
daunting task.

00:01:56.386 --> 00:02:00.486 A:middle
But we do it anyway, because
as you know design matters,

00:01:56.386 --> 00:02:00.486 A:middle
But we do it anyway, because
as you know design matters,

00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:04.966 A:middle
it's important and it can have
a profound impact on the quality

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:07.726 A:middle
of your app and on
the people who use it.

00:02:09.036 --> 00:02:12.316 A:middle
A poorly thought out design
can turn the most basic

00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:15.776 A:middle
and obvious interaction
into a frustrating

00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:17.796 A:middle
and potentially embarrassing
experience.

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:20.796 A:middle
A great design, on
the other hand,

00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:24.286 A:middle
can transform an
intimidating and difficult task

00:02:24.906 --> 00:02:27.736 A:middle
into something simple,
approachable, and elegant.

00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:29.896 A:middle
Even when it's based

00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:33.686 A:middle
on something extraordinarily
complex under the hood.

00:02:34.536 --> 00:02:38.556 A:middle
Now unfortunately there are
no shortcuts to great design.

00:02:39.396 --> 00:02:41.916 A:middle
There's no magic button you
can press to turn a bunch

00:02:41.916 --> 00:02:44.456 A:middle
of disparate features
into a compelling

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:45.526 A:middle
and successful product.

00:02:46.546 --> 00:02:47.976 A:middle
Design is not effortless.

00:02:47.976 --> 00:02:51.986 A:middle
It takes time, commitment,
concentration and rigor.

00:02:51.986 --> 00:02:56.366 A:middle
But the good news is there are
ways to make design easier.

00:02:57.116 --> 00:02:59.896 A:middle
There are tools, techniques
and methods you can use

00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:03.476 A:middle
to mitigate uncertainty
and help you get

00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:03.476 A:middle
to mitigate uncertainty
and help you get

00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:05.056 A:middle
to a great design sooner.

00:03:05.996 --> 00:03:09.476 A:middle
So today, Jon and I are going to
share with you a few techniques

00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:12.446 A:middle
and methods that we use on our
team, in our own design work

00:03:13.216 --> 00:03:16.456 A:middle
to help you find answers
to a few common questions.

00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:19.236 A:middle
Specifically, what
are we making?

00:03:19.786 --> 00:03:21.696 A:middle
Where do we start?

00:03:22.656 --> 00:03:25.426 A:middle
And what's the right design.

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:29.236 A:middle
So first, what are we making?

00:03:29.306 --> 00:03:30.306 A:middle
We're going to start
with this one

00:03:30.306 --> 00:03:33.046 A:middle
because if you can answer this
question it makes all the other

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.706 A:middle
questions a lot easier.

00:03:35.856 --> 00:03:38.686 A:middle
So maybe you have a bunch
of amazing features,

00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:41.696 A:middle
but can't decide which
ones are worth building.

00:03:42.256 --> 00:03:45.336 A:middle
Or maybe you've identified a
potentially lucrative audience,

00:03:45.636 --> 00:03:48.006 A:middle
but don't know exactly what
functionality the people

00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:49.216 A:middle
in that audience want or need.

00:03:49.986 --> 00:03:51.956 A:middle
Or maybe you've built a
really awesome map already,

00:03:51.956 --> 00:03:53.916 A:middle
but don't know who
exactly it's for.

00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:58.186 A:middle
A powerful way to answer those
questions is to define your app.

00:03:58.986 --> 00:04:04.916 A:middle
That is, take all the things you
can imagine your app could do.

00:03:58.986 --> 00:04:04.916 A:middle
That is, take all the things you
can imagine your app could do.

00:04:04.916 --> 00:04:07.666 A:middle
Identify the features that
matter most to the people

00:04:07.666 --> 00:04:11.916 A:middle
who will use your
app, and the features

00:04:12.436 --> 00:04:14.736 A:middle
that serve your own
goals for the app itself,

00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:19.995 A:middle
in order to determine
what your app should do.

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:24.066 A:middle
So as an example, throughout
this session Jon and I are going

00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:25.386 A:middle
to pretend to design an app.

00:04:26.006 --> 00:04:30.536 A:middle
And how many of you here
have been to Caffé Macs?

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:33.736 A:middle
Great. Well, if you haven't
Caffé Macs is the cafeteria

00:04:33.736 --> 00:04:35.816 A:middle
down in Apple Headquarters
in Cupertino.

00:04:35.886 --> 00:04:40.156 A:middle
It has a rotating menu
of freshly prepared food

00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:41.996 A:middle
and most Apply employees
eat there every day.

00:04:42.176 --> 00:04:46.106 A:middle
But a lot of people walk down
to the café, stand in line,

00:04:46.106 --> 00:04:48.936 A:middle
order their food, pay for their
food and then just take it back

00:04:48.936 --> 00:04:50.436 A:middle
to their desk and eat there.

00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:52.936 A:middle
So to make it a little
easier for those people,

00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:55.176 A:middle
we're going to design
an app for a new service

00:04:55.176 --> 00:04:56.996 A:middle
that lets employees order a meal

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:59.026 A:middle
and have it delivered
directly to their office.

00:04:59.496 --> 00:05:00.166 A:middle
Which is pretty cool.

00:04:59.496 --> 00:05:00.166 A:middle
Which is pretty cool.

00:05:00.826 --> 00:05:04.266 A:middle
So, fair warning, you're
going to see a lot of pictures

00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:06.856 A:middle
of food coming up, so if you
weren't able to get breakfast

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:09.426 A:middle
or a snack before the
session, I apologize for that.

00:05:10.856 --> 00:05:13.216 A:middle
So, let's go through the
process of defining this app.

00:05:13.276 --> 00:05:15.736 A:middle
So like I said first,
we need to identify,

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:20.516 A:middle
and collect all the features
we think our app could have.

00:05:20.836 --> 00:05:23.076 A:middle
So you want to include
anything that's obvious.

00:05:23.116 --> 00:05:25.746 A:middle
So we're pretty sure we'll
need a menu of entrees,

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:29.626 A:middle
details about those entrees
and a way to place an order.

00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:33.456 A:middle
But you also, and include
basically anything else.

00:05:33.456 --> 00:05:36.066 A:middle
Capture all the features
you think you

00:05:36.066 --> 00:05:38.266 A:middle
and your audience might
like to see in your app.

00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:41.596 A:middle
So in our case we might want
a way to schedule delivery,

00:05:42.336 --> 00:05:46.346 A:middle
see ratings, quickly
reorder meals.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.956 A:middle
Maybe we could offer
a catering service.

00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:48.786 A:middle
And so on.

00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:51.826 A:middle
There aren't any good or bad
ideas at this stage so feel free

00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:53.696 A:middle
to include anything you want.

00:05:54.516 --> 00:05:56.856 A:middle
And then once you have
your list you actually want

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.986 A:middle
to set it aside for a little bit
because the next thing you need

00:05:58.986 --> 00:06:01.896 A:middle
to do is figure out
who you're designing

00:05:58.986 --> 00:06:01.896 A:middle
to do is figure out
who you're designing

00:06:01.896 --> 00:06:03.146 A:middle
for and what they need.

00:06:03.676 --> 00:06:05.766 A:middle
Now this can often be
one of the hardest steps,

00:06:06.316 --> 00:06:09.396 A:middle
because it's not uncommon
for people on the same team

00:06:09.396 --> 00:06:12.466 A:middle
to have completely
different ideas in their mind

00:06:12.466 --> 00:06:14.906 A:middle
about who is going
to be using your app.

00:06:15.516 --> 00:06:18.256 A:middle
But without a shared
understanding

00:06:18.756 --> 00:06:23.366 A:middle
of who your user is, and what
their goals are you might end

00:06:23.366 --> 00:06:27.066 A:middle
up with a hodgepodge of features
that nobody needs, or worse,

00:06:27.066 --> 00:06:29.316 A:middle
you might spend a lot of time
and effort building an app

00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:33.196 A:middle
that nobody knows about because
you targeted the wrong audience.

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:36.266 A:middle
So let's start with a
couple of simple tips.

00:06:36.266 --> 00:06:38.556 A:middle
First, you are not the user.

00:06:38.736 --> 00:06:43.576 A:middle
You might be a user of your app,
but if you design for yourself,

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:46.346 A:middle
you risk building in
preconceptions and biases

00:06:46.736 --> 00:06:47.626 A:middle
about the user experience

00:06:47.626 --> 00:06:49.946 A:middle
that might be completely
wrong for everyone else.

00:06:50.826 --> 00:06:54.386 A:middle
For example, I'm an Apple
employee and I'll be a user

00:06:54.386 --> 00:06:56.406 A:middle
of the Caffé Macs app
that we're going to design,

00:06:56.936 --> 00:06:59.486 A:middle
but I almost exclusively
eat cheeseburgers.

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:03.836 A:middle
And if I were to design the
app for my interest alone,

00:07:03.836 --> 00:07:06.176 A:middle
I'd put the burger of the
day at the top of the screen,

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.306 A:middle
and that would be it because
that's all I really care about.

00:07:08.306 --> 00:07:13.386 A:middle
And that would be great for me,
but maybe not so much for people

00:07:13.386 --> 00:07:16.996 A:middle
who prefer salad, or who like
fish, or whatever else it is

00:07:16.996 --> 00:07:18.486 A:middle
that normal people eat.

00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:22.256 A:middle
Designing for yourself
distracts you

00:07:22.256 --> 00:07:24.616 A:middle
from what matters
most to everyone else.

00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:27.316 A:middle
But the opposite is also true.

00:07:28.526 --> 00:07:30.516 A:middle
Your audience should
not be everyone,

00:07:30.626 --> 00:07:32.486 A:middle
because this is too
vague, it doesn't allow you

00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:34.896 A:middle
to draw any meaningful
conclusions

00:07:35.116 --> 00:07:38.226 A:middle
about what would be most
important, or most valuable

00:07:38.226 --> 00:07:39.736 A:middle
to the real people
who will use your app.

00:07:40.676 --> 00:07:44.196 A:middle
Instead you need to focus on
the essential characteristics

00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:45.576 A:middle
of your target audience.

00:07:46.496 --> 00:07:48.476 A:middle
And one way to do that is

00:07:48.476 --> 00:07:50.646 A:middle
to image you're interviewing
someone who's going

00:07:50.646 --> 00:07:52.916 A:middle
to use your app to
find out what they like

00:07:52.916 --> 00:07:55.296 A:middle
and what they don't like,
and what they care about.

00:07:56.436 --> 00:08:00.796 A:middle
In our case, we might ask our
customer do they prefer a fresh

00:07:56.436 --> 00:08:00.796 A:middle
In our case, we might ask our
customer do they prefer a fresh

00:08:00.796 --> 00:08:02.616 A:middle
meal, or something
off the shelf?

00:08:02.896 --> 00:08:04.546 A:middle
Do they like to take
a leisurely lunch,

00:08:04.746 --> 00:08:06.416 A:middle
or just grab something
between meetings?

00:08:07.446 --> 00:08:09.246 A:middle
Do they get the same
thing every day?

00:08:09.246 --> 00:08:11.736 A:middle
Or do they like to try
something new and different?

00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:14.496 A:middle
And do they prefer
to eat healthy food?

00:08:14.496 --> 00:08:16.846 A:middle
Or do they just pickup
whatever looks good?

00:08:17.856 --> 00:08:20.676 A:middle
Try to capture a range
of characteristics

00:08:20.976 --> 00:08:22.206 A:middle
in a few questions like these.

00:08:23.526 --> 00:08:29.126 A:middle
And then pick the answers that
best reflect the people you want

00:08:29.156 --> 00:08:30.226 A:middle
to serve with your app.

00:08:31.346 --> 00:08:33.586 A:middle
You can use your instinct
and expertise to do this,

00:08:33.586 --> 00:08:36.106 A:middle
and if you have user
research or marketing data,

00:08:36.106 --> 00:08:37.866 A:middle
you can use that to
inform your choices too.

00:08:39.645 --> 00:08:42.626 A:middle
In our case, it's already pretty
easy to walk down to the Caffé

00:08:42.626 --> 00:08:44.346 A:middle
and get a premade
salad or sandwich.

00:08:44.736 --> 00:08:48.066 A:middle
So, instead, we want to focus
on the people who are looking

00:08:48.066 --> 00:08:52.506 A:middle
for a quick interesting, fresh,
and healthy meal every day.

00:08:53.436 --> 00:08:57.066 A:middle
Once you know the
characteristics

00:08:57.066 --> 00:08:59.156 A:middle
of your customer, you
can rephrase those

00:08:59.156 --> 00:09:00.026 A:middle
as a set of goals.

00:08:59.156 --> 00:09:00.026 A:middle
as a set of goals.

00:09:00.986 --> 00:09:04.916 A:middle
So, our customer goals
are to eat a fresh meal,

00:09:05.416 --> 00:09:06.586 A:middle
eat quickly, or sorry.

00:09:06.586 --> 00:09:09.846 A:middle
Enjoy a fresh meal, eat
quickly, try something new,

00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:11.276 A:middle
and make healthy choices.

00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:13.416 A:middle
Articulating your
audiences' goals

00:09:13.416 --> 00:09:15.296 A:middle
like this will help you focus

00:09:15.296 --> 00:09:17.376 A:middle
on their needs throughout
the design process.

00:09:19.496 --> 00:09:20.506 A:middle
But what about you?

00:09:20.636 --> 00:09:24.366 A:middle
What about your goals as an app
developer, or a product owner?

00:09:25.076 --> 00:09:27.786 A:middle
Maybe you want people to
rely on your app every day.

00:09:27.786 --> 00:09:32.326 A:middle
Or maybe you want it to be a
super fun app to play with.

00:09:32.326 --> 00:09:35.446 A:middle
Or maybe you want it
to be blazing fast.

00:09:35.826 --> 00:09:37.716 A:middle
You want to capture those
characteristics too,

00:09:37.926 --> 00:09:45.026 A:middle
as app goals that describe what
you think your app should be

00:09:45.026 --> 00:09:46.786 A:middle
like, how it should feel

00:09:47.006 --> 00:09:49.596 A:middle
and what makes it
memorable, or unique.

00:09:51.396 --> 00:09:53.436 A:middle
So our app goals might be

00:09:53.436 --> 00:09:56.876 A:middle
to provide a convenient
simple delivery service,

00:09:56.926 --> 00:09:59.966 A:middle
so people don't have to walk
all the way to the café.

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:02.676 A:middle
We want to highlight
the daily entrees

00:10:02.986 --> 00:10:05.086 A:middle
so customers know
all the great options

00:10:05.086 --> 00:10:05.996 A:middle
that are available to them.

00:10:06.886 --> 00:10:09.676 A:middle
And we want Caffé Macs
diners to be happy, of course,

00:10:09.986 --> 00:10:10.886 A:middle
so they keep coming back.

00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:14.246 A:middle
Now, note that this list
does not include things like,

00:10:14.506 --> 00:10:17.486 A:middle
be profitable, or earn a
great return on investment,

00:10:18.156 --> 00:10:20.976 A:middle
or optimize food costs.

00:10:21.826 --> 00:10:24.636 A:middle
While those are important goals
from a business standpoint,

00:10:25.026 --> 00:10:27.226 A:middle
they don't really provide
any meaningful direction

00:10:27.666 --> 00:10:28.646 A:middle
for the design.

00:10:28.886 --> 00:10:32.976 A:middle
And that's because business
goals describe what you want

00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:35.526 A:middle
to get out of your app
after you release it.

00:10:36.296 --> 00:10:39.396 A:middle
App goals on the other
hand describe the qualities

00:10:39.396 --> 00:10:42.926 A:middle
of experience you want
your users to have.

00:10:43.116 --> 00:10:45.676 A:middle
You need to understand both
types of goals, of course.

00:10:45.676 --> 00:10:49.186 A:middle
But it's your app goals that
will inspire and motivate you

00:10:49.186 --> 00:10:50.986 A:middle
to design and build
a great product.

00:10:52.756 --> 00:10:54.716 A:middle
All right so finally, to figure

00:10:54.716 --> 00:10:56.786 A:middle
out what exactly
our app should do,

00:10:56.786 --> 00:10:59.106 A:middle
we need to consider all those
features we came up with

00:10:59.286 --> 00:11:01.686 A:middle
in step one from the perspective

00:10:59.286 --> 00:11:01.686 A:middle
in step one from the perspective

00:11:01.686 --> 00:11:05.136 A:middle
of our customer goals
and our app goals.

00:11:05.266 --> 00:11:06.516 A:middle
So, here's our list again.

00:11:07.376 --> 00:11:09.676 A:middle
And by looking at each one
of these in the context

00:11:09.676 --> 00:11:12.996 A:middle
of our goals, you can pretty
quickly identify the ones

00:11:13.916 --> 00:11:15.256 A:middle
that are appropriate
for our app.

00:11:15.256 --> 00:11:17.876 A:middle
So, in addition to the
basic functionality,

00:11:18.476 --> 00:11:21.436 A:middle
we can also include an
entree rating system

00:11:21.736 --> 00:11:25.026 A:middle
that serves our customers'
goals, finding something new

00:11:25.026 --> 00:11:25.876 A:middle
and interesting to eat.

00:11:26.636 --> 00:11:28.896 A:middle
And a feedback link
serves our own app goals

00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:32.686 A:middle
of making diners happy
because it gives them a way

00:11:32.686 --> 00:11:34.866 A:middle
to let us know if
they're satisfied or not.

00:11:36.096 --> 00:11:38.826 A:middle
By the same method we
can also exclude features

00:11:38.826 --> 00:11:40.146 A:middle
that do not serve our goals.

00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:42.976 A:middle
Now this isn't to say
that these are bad ideas,

00:11:43.126 --> 00:11:44.846 A:middle
or that they're not
worth doing some day,

00:11:45.156 --> 00:11:47.386 A:middle
they just don't fit our
current definition of our app.

00:11:47.966 --> 00:11:50.536 A:middle
So we can set them aside
for now and maybe get back

00:11:50.536 --> 00:11:51.786 A:middle
to them in a future release.

00:11:53.496 --> 00:11:54.826 A:middle
All right, check this out.

00:11:54.826 --> 00:11:57.276 A:middle
Now that we actually
have a list of features

00:11:57.276 --> 00:11:58.236 A:middle
and we know what we're making.

00:11:58.236 --> 00:12:02.146 A:middle
We have a nice succinct
set of functionality based

00:11:58.236 --> 00:12:02.146 A:middle
We have a nice succinct
set of functionality based

00:12:02.146 --> 00:12:06.056 A:middle
on a solid understanding of
what's most important to us,

00:12:06.116 --> 00:12:09.356 A:middle
and what's going to matter to
the people who will use our app.

00:12:10.226 --> 00:12:11.906 A:middle
And so now to tell
you more about how

00:12:11.906 --> 00:12:14.076 A:middle
to actually start
designing your features,

00:12:14.076 --> 00:12:15.416 A:middle
I'm going to hand
things over to Jon.

00:12:16.516 --> 00:12:21.836 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:22.336 --> 00:12:22.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Ryan.

00:12:23.466 --> 00:12:27.196 A:middle
So now that know
what we're making,

00:12:27.196 --> 00:12:28.346 A:middle
let's start designing our app.

00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:30.256 A:middle
But where do we start?

00:12:31.196 --> 00:12:36.326 A:middle
Well what I like to do is I
like to start with what I know.

00:12:36.326 --> 00:12:38.846 A:middle
You might not know how all
of your app is going to look

00:12:38.846 --> 00:12:40.566 A:middle
or work yet, but
there's probably one

00:12:40.566 --> 00:12:42.296 A:middle
or two things you
do know you'll need

00:12:42.606 --> 00:12:44.056 A:middle
and you can start
by designing that.

00:12:44.656 --> 00:12:49.016 A:middle
For example, if you're designing
a messaging app, you might want

00:12:49.016 --> 00:12:51.426 A:middle
to start by designing
the conversation screen,

00:12:51.426 --> 00:12:53.246 A:middle
because you know that's where
a lot of people are going

00:12:53.246 --> 00:12:54.076 A:middle
to be spending their time.

00:12:54.826 --> 00:12:57.506 A:middle
Or, if you're designing a
dating app, you might start

00:12:57.506 --> 00:13:00.096 A:middle
by designing the profile
screen, because you know

00:12:57.506 --> 00:13:00.096 A:middle
by designing the profile
screen, because you know

00:13:00.096 --> 00:13:01.816 A:middle
that that's going to be a
big part of your experience.

00:13:03.336 --> 00:13:07.666 A:middle
In our case, I'm designing
a food delivery app.

00:13:08.206 --> 00:13:10.156 A:middle
So I don't know much
about what I need,

00:13:10.576 --> 00:13:13.906 A:middle
but I know at the very least,
I'm going to need a menu of food

00:13:13.906 --> 00:13:15.726 A:middle
so that people can
order from it.

00:13:16.316 --> 00:13:18.466 A:middle
So I'll start by
designing the menu screen.

00:13:20.636 --> 00:13:24.546 A:middle
So for this demo, I'm going
to design UI in Keynote.

00:13:25.326 --> 00:13:28.036 A:middle
You might already know Keynote
as a great presentation app,

00:13:28.036 --> 00:13:31.786 A:middle
but it's also a great
app to draw UI.

00:13:32.276 --> 00:13:34.706 A:middle
It creates layouts very easily,

00:13:34.706 --> 00:13:36.516 A:middle
you can try out different
animations.

00:13:36.826 --> 00:13:38.596 A:middle
You can even make
interactive prototypes

00:13:38.596 --> 00:13:39.796 A:middle
that you can load
onto your phone.

00:13:40.826 --> 00:13:44.196 A:middle
In our group, we like Keynote
so much that we design all

00:13:44.196 --> 00:13:45.526 A:middle
of our apps using Keynote.

00:13:46.376 --> 00:13:49.306 A:middle
In fact, even Keynote was
designed using Keynote.

00:13:50.906 --> 00:13:51.476 A:middle
Think about that.

00:13:52.516 --> 00:13:55.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:13:56.046 --> 00:13:57.506 A:middle
That shouldn't even be possible.

00:13:58.566 --> 00:14:00.546 A:middle
But it is because
Keynote is awesome.

00:13:58.566 --> 00:14:00.546 A:middle
But it is because
Keynote is awesome.

00:14:01.546 --> 00:14:07.226 A:middle
So, let's start drawing UI.

00:14:07.866 --> 00:14:11.536 A:middle
UI is made up of a
couple of simple elements.

00:14:11.836 --> 00:14:13.276 A:middle
It's made up of shapes and lines

00:14:13.276 --> 00:14:15.276 A:middle
and I can insert those
from my top here.

00:14:15.276 --> 00:14:17.206 A:middle
I can just tap to
insert a shape.

00:14:17.406 --> 00:14:18.996 A:middle
I can tap to insert a line.

00:14:20.136 --> 00:14:21.486 A:middle
UI also has text.

00:14:21.566 --> 00:14:23.476 A:middle
And I can insert
text by clicking

00:14:23.476 --> 00:14:24.926 A:middle
on this and get a textbox.

00:14:26.286 --> 00:14:28.346 A:middle
And UI also has images.

00:14:29.146 --> 00:14:32.676 A:middle
On my desktop I have
a folder of food

00:14:32.676 --> 00:14:34.096 A:middle
and I can just drag
it into Keynote.

00:14:34.546 --> 00:14:37.066 A:middle
And I can resize that.

00:14:38.376 --> 00:14:41.826 A:middle
Great. So to start, I'm just
going to start with a shape.

00:14:41.826 --> 00:14:43.306 A:middle
I'm going to copy
and paste a shape.

00:14:43.376 --> 00:14:48.546 A:middle
I'm going to change its
size to 375 by 667 points,

00:14:48.806 --> 00:14:50.856 A:middle
because this is the
resolution of an iPhone 6.

00:14:51.816 --> 00:14:56.706 A:middle
And I'm going to make it white
and put it right on the center.

00:14:56.786 --> 00:14:59.896 A:middle
So in just 30 seconds I've
already designed a simple

00:14:59.896 --> 00:15:00.306 A:middle
iPhone app.

00:14:59.896 --> 00:15:00.306 A:middle
iPhone app.

00:15:01.646 --> 00:15:02.566 A:middle
It's a flashlight.

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:04.006 A:middle
Ha,ha [laughter].

00:15:05.396 --> 00:15:06.086 A:middle
I'm just kidding.

00:15:07.356 --> 00:15:10.496 A:middle
So I'm going to draw a menu
screen, and one thing I

00:15:10.496 --> 00:15:14.136 A:middle
like to do is I like to take
screenshots of apps that I use

00:15:14.136 --> 00:15:15.216 A:middle
and use them as references.

00:15:15.616 --> 00:15:19.586 A:middle
So here I have a screenshot
that I took of my messages app.

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:20.876 A:middle
So I'm just going
to drag that in.

00:15:21.136 --> 00:15:24.336 A:middle
It comes in a little large
because it's retina resolution.

00:15:24.336 --> 00:15:27.386 A:middle
So I'm just going to resize it.

00:15:27.386 --> 00:15:31.356 A:middle
And I'm going to put this next
to my screen that I'm drawing.

00:15:32.776 --> 00:15:35.016 A:middle
And now that I have
this screenshot next

00:15:35.016 --> 00:15:37.026 A:middle
to what I'm drawing, I
can use it as a reference.

00:15:37.266 --> 00:15:40.836 A:middle
So I'm going to start by
taking shapes and outlining

00:15:40.836 --> 00:15:42.696 A:middle
out the layout of my screen.

00:15:43.216 --> 00:15:47.426 A:middle
So I'm just going to resize
this box to be a header square.

00:15:47.826 --> 00:15:50.326 A:middle
I turned on my accessibility
zoom functionality

00:15:50.456 --> 00:15:52.846 A:middle
in system preferences so I
could zoom in really quickly

00:15:53.026 --> 00:15:55.456 A:middle
and make sure that
everything is pixel perfect.

00:15:56.736 --> 00:15:59.896 A:middle
Okay. I'm going to do
the same thing for lines.

00:16:00.356 --> 00:16:05.546 A:middle
I know that this
line is 1 point.

00:16:11.166 --> 00:16:12.076 A:middle
Again, I'm going to zoom

00:16:12.076 --> 00:16:16.686 A:middle
in to make sure it is
exactly where I want it.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:20.346 A:middle
Great and now I'm just going

00:16:20.466 --> 00:16:22.936 A:middle
to start duplicating this
line a bunch of times.

00:16:23.556 --> 00:16:27.716 A:middle
I don't really care where
it's positioned right now.

00:16:27.716 --> 00:16:28.746 A:middle
I can be a little bit sloppy,

00:16:29.836 --> 00:16:30.996 A:middle
because I'll clean
that up later.

00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:35.936 A:middle
The only one I do care
about is this last line.

00:16:36.016 --> 00:16:39.956 A:middle
I want to make sure that
this last line is exactly

00:16:39.956 --> 00:16:41.886 A:middle
where I want it.

00:16:42.106 --> 00:16:46.426 A:middle
Great, because now I can
just select all of my lines

00:16:47.616 --> 00:16:50.976 A:middle
and space them out evenly,
and the line then to the left.

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:52.436 A:middle
So that was a really quick way

00:16:52.436 --> 00:16:53.666 A:middle
to just get all my lines
in place [applause].

00:16:55.526 --> 00:16:58.866 A:middle
Oh, okay. That was not
even the impressive part.

00:16:59.476 --> 00:17:02.726 A:middle
So now I want to change
the colors of my lines

00:16:59.476 --> 00:17:02.726 A:middle
So now I want to change
the colors of my lines

00:17:02.726 --> 00:17:03.716 A:middle
and I can do that here.

00:17:03.886 --> 00:17:04.945 A:middle
I can make it gray.

00:17:05.296 --> 00:17:06.826 A:middle
Or if I wanted to
use a specific color,

00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:08.596 A:middle
I could use the system
color picker,

00:17:08.996 --> 00:17:10.096 A:middle
and use the eyedropper tool.

00:17:11.076 --> 00:17:13.476 A:middle
This turns my mouse
into a magnifying glass

00:17:13.476 --> 00:17:16.516 A:middle
and now I can click on a
specific color on my screen

00:17:16.796 --> 00:17:18.796 A:middle
and it will use that
color for the line.

00:17:18.846 --> 00:17:21.606 A:middle
And now I'll do the same
thing with my header bar.

00:17:21.606 --> 00:17:23.086 A:middle
I'll get this light gray.

00:17:24.106 --> 00:17:26.156 A:middle
So I've already got the outline

00:17:26.156 --> 00:17:27.715 A:middle
of the screen that
I want to draw.

00:17:27.715 --> 00:17:30.846 A:middle
So the next thing I want
to do is match the text.

00:17:31.136 --> 00:17:34.736 A:middle
So I'm going to take this
text box, and I can try

00:17:34.736 --> 00:17:37.336 A:middle
to match the style of the
text of the messages app.

00:17:37.336 --> 00:17:42.136 A:middle
So I can start by just typing in
the text that I want to match.

00:17:42.636 --> 00:17:45.126 A:middle
You can see that the font
and the size is incorrect.

00:17:46.136 --> 00:17:50.556 A:middle
I know that iPhone system
font is San Francisco.

00:17:50.916 --> 00:17:52.476 A:middle
So I can set it to
San Francisco.

00:17:52.946 --> 00:17:55.536 A:middle
And I'm just going to
make this font smaller.

00:17:56.476 --> 00:18:00.086 A:middle
It looks like what I'm trying
to match is actually semi-bold.

00:17:56.476 --> 00:18:00.086 A:middle
It looks like what I'm trying
to match is actually semi-bold.

00:18:00.196 --> 00:18:03.446 A:middle
And I could actually
just zoom in there

00:18:03.446 --> 00:18:05.586 A:middle
and make sure that it is exact.

00:18:06.156 --> 00:18:07.936 A:middle
Great. So it looks like
a pretty close match.

00:18:08.266 --> 00:18:11.666 A:middle
I can do the same
thing for this subtext.

00:18:21.456 --> 00:18:22.866 A:middle
Close enough.

00:18:24.256 --> 00:18:28.406 A:middle
Okay. So now I've got my
text looking like the text

00:18:28.406 --> 00:18:31.586 A:middle
on my screenshot, and
this actually looks,

00:18:32.156 --> 00:18:37.016 A:middle
maybe like it's gray so I'm
going to drop the opacity a bit.

00:18:38.226 --> 00:18:39.666 A:middle
So now the next thing I want

00:18:39.666 --> 00:18:41.996 A:middle
to do is start putting
content into my UI.

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:45.096 A:middle
I've got this text file

00:18:45.096 --> 00:18:47.696 A:middle
of different entree
names and descriptions.

00:18:47.696 --> 00:18:49.616 A:middle
So I'm just going to copy and
paste some of these in here.

00:18:57.126 --> 00:18:58.886 A:middle
Resize this.

00:18:59.126 --> 00:19:04.326 A:middle
Great. I also want to get
the title of my screen.

00:18:59.126 --> 00:19:04.326 A:middle
Great. I also want to get
the title of my screen.

00:19:04.736 --> 00:19:08.656 A:middle
So I'll try to match that.

00:19:09.386 --> 00:19:12.036 A:middle
This looks like it's
actually the right size.

00:19:12.626 --> 00:19:13.016 A:middle
That's great.

00:19:14.146 --> 00:19:15.426 A:middle
Stick this in the center.

00:19:17.996 --> 00:19:20.856 A:middle
And I'll call this Caffé Macs.

00:19:22.186 --> 00:19:25.956 A:middle
Okay. So now I've got some
pretty good text in here.

00:19:26.826 --> 00:19:29.256 A:middle
The next thing I want to
do is put in some images.

00:19:29.426 --> 00:19:33.886 A:middle
I'm going to take my picture
of my mahi-mahi and resize it.

00:19:35.026 --> 00:19:39.576 A:middle
Now I want to get the
sizing and the shape exact.

00:19:39.686 --> 00:19:40.846 A:middle
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:43.786 A:middle
to use a shape and
use it as a mask.

00:19:44.296 --> 00:19:47.976 A:middle
So I'm going to just make this
square the exact size I want.

00:19:48.986 --> 00:19:53.936 A:middle
And now, if I select
both of them,

00:19:53.936 --> 00:19:58.936 A:middle
I can crop the image
using the shape.

00:19:59.206 --> 00:20:02.156 A:middle
Going to nudge it a bit.

00:19:59.206 --> 00:20:02.156 A:middle
Going to nudge it a bit.

00:20:02.366 --> 00:20:02.756 A:middle
Excellent.

00:20:04.076 --> 00:20:07.496 A:middle
And now my picture of fish
is the exact size I wanted.

00:20:08.606 --> 00:20:11.706 A:middle
I can mask images in other ways.

00:20:12.056 --> 00:20:15.696 A:middle
I want to get the status
bar of this screenshot.

00:20:15.696 --> 00:20:16.576 A:middle
I don't want to draw it.

00:20:16.976 --> 00:20:19.196 A:middle
So I'm just going to
duplicate this image,

00:20:19.196 --> 00:20:20.546 A:middle
double click the mask it

00:20:20.926 --> 00:20:23.276 A:middle
and just grab the bar
and stick it on top.

00:20:23.276 --> 00:20:25.896 A:middle
I saved myself a
couple minutes there.

00:20:25.986 --> 00:20:30.636 A:middle
And the last thing I want,
is I want this little arrow.

00:20:30.636 --> 00:20:31.886 A:middle
I've got this other trick.

00:20:32.076 --> 00:20:34.496 A:middle
I can actually take a
screenshot of any part

00:20:34.496 --> 00:20:39.016 A:middle
of my screen using the
keyboard shortcut command,

00:20:39.016 --> 00:20:40.106 A:middle
control, shift 4.

00:20:40.626 --> 00:20:42.126 A:middle
It's hard to remember,
but it's useful.

00:20:42.126 --> 00:20:45.266 A:middle
When I do that it turns my
mouse cursor into a camera.

00:20:45.756 --> 00:20:48.656 A:middle
And now I can just draw
a box around this arrow.

00:20:49.276 --> 00:20:54.156 A:middle
And it's copied to my clipboard
and now I can just paste that.

00:20:54.156 --> 00:20:57.356 A:middle
So that's a not well
known keyboard shortcut.

00:20:58.646 --> 00:21:00.456 A:middle
Great. So now I've got one row.

00:20:58.646 --> 00:21:00.456 A:middle
Great. So now I've got one row.

00:21:00.456 --> 00:21:03.876 A:middle
So I'm going to group
these together.

00:21:03.966 --> 00:21:06.976 A:middle
And again, I'm going to do the
same thing I did with my lines.

00:21:07.096 --> 00:21:10.846 A:middle
The only one I care about
getting right is this last one,

00:21:11.756 --> 00:21:16.746 A:middle
because I can just
select all of them,

00:21:16.946 --> 00:21:18.886 A:middle
space them out and align them.

00:21:20.256 --> 00:21:22.926 A:middle
Great. And now the
only thing I have

00:21:22.926 --> 00:21:27.176 A:middle
to do is replace these images
and copy paste some more content

00:21:27.176 --> 00:21:30.406 A:middle
in there to get it
looking like a real screen.

00:21:30.406 --> 00:21:34.026 A:middle
To save some time I've actually
drawn the screen beforehand.

00:21:34.556 --> 00:21:38.316 A:middle
So it looks something
like this once I swapped

00:21:38.316 --> 00:21:39.686 A:middle
out all of the content.

00:21:40.706 --> 00:21:43.796 A:middle
So in just I don't know, three
minutes, I drew the screen.

00:21:44.516 --> 00:21:50.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:51.046 --> 00:21:54.646 A:middle
So I want to talk a little bit
about the exact steps I took

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:55.826 A:middle
in the last couple minutes.

00:21:56.386 --> 00:21:58.526 A:middle
I started by using
screenshots as references

00:21:58.916 --> 00:22:01.636 A:middle
to match colors,
sizes and texts.

00:21:58.916 --> 00:22:01.636 A:middle
to match colors,
sizes and texts.

00:22:02.146 --> 00:22:04.156 A:middle
I also used screenshots
to collage bits

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:05.466 A:middle
of UI that I wanted to use.

00:22:06.236 --> 00:22:09.316 A:middle
I drew a bunch of squares and
lines, and I resized them a bit

00:22:09.316 --> 00:22:11.636 A:middle
and I zoomed in and
out a lot to make sure

00:22:11.636 --> 00:22:12.676 A:middle
that they were pixel perfect.

00:22:13.126 --> 00:22:17.256 A:middle
And I used believable content
so that, I used realistic photos

00:22:17.256 --> 00:22:20.836 A:middle
and texts to make my UI
look more believable.

00:22:22.146 --> 00:22:24.806 A:middle
I think with a little
bit of practice

00:22:24.806 --> 00:22:27.066 A:middle
and effort these steps
are simple enough

00:22:27.066 --> 00:22:28.886 A:middle
that anyone here can
do what I just did.

00:22:29.476 --> 00:22:31.686 A:middle
So now I'll hand
things back to Ryan.

00:22:33.516 --> 00:22:38.006 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:38.506 --> 00:22:39.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Jon.

00:22:39.646 --> 00:22:40.826 A:middle
Great work as always.

00:22:42.546 --> 00:22:47.456 A:middle
All right so here's our
awesome Caffé Macs menu design.

00:22:48.116 --> 00:22:49.466 A:middle
And we're done.

00:22:49.566 --> 00:22:51.016 A:middle
Right? This seems good enough.

00:22:51.306 --> 00:22:53.806 A:middle
Meets all the functional
criteria of a menu.

00:22:54.216 --> 00:22:54.736 A:middle
Looks great.

00:22:55.236 --> 00:22:57.636 A:middle
It's tempting to just
stop here and move

00:22:57.636 --> 00:22:59.956 A:middle
onto the next feature
or the next screen.

00:23:00.816 --> 00:23:02.786 A:middle
But how do we actually know

00:23:02.826 --> 00:23:05.686 A:middle
if this first design
is the right design?

00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:09.966 A:middle
Well, I can tell you from
experience it's probably not.

00:23:10.756 --> 00:23:13.826 A:middle
And that's because you can't
know if your design is right

00:23:14.066 --> 00:23:15.276 A:middle
if you try only one idea.

00:23:16.536 --> 00:23:19.486 A:middle
Instead you need to look at
the problem from other angles

00:23:19.646 --> 00:23:26.556 A:middle
and iterate on your design to
find new insights and approaches

00:23:26.556 --> 00:23:27.876 A:middle
that you might miss otherwise.

00:23:29.496 --> 00:23:33.016 A:middle
Basically, you want to look
at your app design and ask,

00:23:33.226 --> 00:23:34.296 A:middle
what could we do differently?

00:23:35.086 --> 00:23:38.266 A:middle
So here's our design again,
what could we do differently?

00:23:39.146 --> 00:23:42.546 A:middle
Well, in our case, it's based
on, our design is based on rows

00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:44.896 A:middle
so one thing you can do is just
change the size of the rows.

00:23:45.426 --> 00:23:48.246 A:middle
Here by making the rows taller,
we can't fit as many entrees,

00:23:48.246 --> 00:23:49.646 A:middle
but we can make the
photos larger.

00:23:50.446 --> 00:23:53.006 A:middle
And you can also increase
or decrease the amount

00:23:53.006 --> 00:23:54.306 A:middle
of information that's
on the screen,

00:23:54.306 --> 00:23:55.706 A:middle
so here we've added the prices.

00:23:56.336 --> 00:23:59.796 A:middle
You can consider different
layouts, and adjust the amount

00:23:59.796 --> 00:24:01.896 A:middle
of white space between
your content.

00:23:59.796 --> 00:24:01.896 A:middle
of white space between
your content.

00:24:01.896 --> 00:24:04.686 A:middle
That's the space around
and between the things

00:24:04.686 --> 00:24:05.436 A:middle
that are on your screen.

00:24:05.546 --> 00:24:07.946 A:middle
So here we've added margins
around the photos which opens

00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:08.936 A:middle
up the UI a little bit.

00:24:09.866 --> 00:24:11.966 A:middle
You can also try
different topography styles.

00:24:11.966 --> 00:24:15.766 A:middle
For example, here we're using
a larger, lighter weight font

00:24:16.226 --> 00:24:18.796 A:middle
for the names, and we've
added some color to the prices

00:24:18.796 --> 00:24:20.506 A:middle
to make them stand out on
screen a little bit more.

00:24:21.086 --> 00:24:24.496 A:middle
You can also just go where
your curiosity takes you.

00:24:24.496 --> 00:24:27.076 A:middle
So, we wondered, what it the
menu didn't have pictures

00:24:27.076 --> 00:24:28.226 A:middle
of food, because why not?

00:24:28.596 --> 00:24:29.216 A:middle
It's worth a try.

00:24:29.966 --> 00:24:32.766 A:middle
But what we found is that
without a visual anchor

00:24:32.896 --> 00:24:36.576 A:middle
on each row, we needed to
make the entrée names bigger

00:24:36.576 --> 00:24:39.066 A:middle
and bolder, which gives
the menu a different feel.

00:24:40.216 --> 00:24:42.036 A:middle
And note that I'm not
actually judging any

00:24:42.036 --> 00:24:42.766 A:middle
of these designs yet.

00:24:43.596 --> 00:24:45.756 A:middle
We're just really brainstorming
with pictures to kind

00:24:45.756 --> 00:24:46.856 A:middle
of shake out new ideas.

00:24:47.606 --> 00:24:50.726 A:middle
So another technique you
can use is to do a 180.

00:24:50.726 --> 00:24:52.996 A:middle
So while this design
is very text oriented,

00:24:54.046 --> 00:24:56.736 A:middle
what about one that's
very image oriented?

00:24:56.736 --> 00:24:58.246 A:middle
So we have a grid
of photos here.

00:24:58.246 --> 00:24:59.926 A:middle
It kind of looks like a
totally different app right.

00:25:00.296 --> 00:25:03.366 A:middle
You can also think about the
proportions of your imagery

00:25:03.826 --> 00:25:06.756 A:middle
and what shapes suit
your content the best.

00:25:07.096 --> 00:25:08.656 A:middle
So while these photos
are square,

00:25:09.096 --> 00:25:11.196 A:middle
maybe wider landscape
photos work better.

00:25:12.276 --> 00:25:14.806 A:middle
You can also look at different
ways to contain your content.

00:25:15.116 --> 00:25:17.356 A:middle
Here each entrée is
on a tile or a card,

00:25:17.676 --> 00:25:20.646 A:middle
which helps them feel more like
distinct items on the screen.

00:25:22.536 --> 00:25:24.826 A:middle
Think about how you use
the space available to you,

00:25:25.096 --> 00:25:26.636 A:middle
these photos are edge-to-edge,

00:25:26.816 --> 00:25:28.676 A:middle
which makes the most
of the iPhone screen.

00:25:29.276 --> 00:25:31.416 A:middle
And in this layout to
fit the entree details,

00:25:31.586 --> 00:25:33.846 A:middle
we superimposed them
on the photos

00:25:34.116 --> 00:25:36.346 A:middle
to create a different
visual style.

00:25:40.596 --> 00:25:42.256 A:middle
And remember you
aren't restricted

00:25:42.256 --> 00:25:44.886 A:middle
to a uniform grid
of boxes or rows.

00:25:45.156 --> 00:25:47.686 A:middle
You can play with the size and
proportions of your content

00:25:47.686 --> 00:25:51.326 A:middle
to create completely
different effects.

00:25:51.326 --> 00:25:53.016 A:middle
You can combine ideas
to create new ones.

00:25:53.016 --> 00:25:54.946 A:middle
So, here we took the
edge-to-edge photo-style

00:25:55.106 --> 00:25:57.856 A:middle
and merged it with the list
view layout of our first design.

00:26:01.516 --> 00:26:04.246 A:middle
Think about how immersive you
want the experience to be.

00:26:04.246 --> 00:26:06.786 A:middle
These larger photos
dominate the screen,

00:26:07.086 --> 00:26:09.806 A:middle
which encourages the viewer to
spend more time with each one.

00:26:10.316 --> 00:26:14.406 A:middle
And if your text is critical
make sure you pay attention

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:15.396 A:middle
to how readable it is.

00:26:15.756 --> 00:26:17.346 A:middle
Can somebody with
a vision impairment

00:26:17.346 --> 00:26:19.916 A:middle
or color blindness make
out the important details?

00:26:20.486 --> 00:26:26.506 A:middle
And finally what if we took this
large photo idea to an extreme

00:26:26.876 --> 00:26:30.116 A:middle
so that the image takes up
basically the whole screen.

00:26:31.276 --> 00:26:33.206 A:middle
Here scrolling vertically
might be a little strange,

00:26:33.206 --> 00:26:37.246 A:middle
so instead we're using a
swipe navigation scheme

00:26:37.246 --> 00:26:38.716 A:middle
so you just swipe
between the entrees.

00:26:39.996 --> 00:26:41.726 A:middle
So, consider how your
content could be served

00:26:41.726 --> 00:26:43.026 A:middle
by different navigation schemes.

00:26:43.556 --> 00:26:47.886 A:middle
All right so here
are 11 alternatives

00:26:47.886 --> 00:26:48.956 A:middle
to our original design.

00:26:49.286 --> 00:26:50.676 A:middle
These were all drawn
in Keynote as well.

00:26:51.556 --> 00:26:54.526 A:middle
And you want to basically
just keep asking what can we

00:26:54.526 --> 00:26:55.196 A:middle
do differently?

00:26:55.596 --> 00:26:57.996 A:middle
Until you've come
up and expressed

00:26:57.996 --> 00:27:00.686 A:middle
as many interesting alternatives
as you can come up with.

00:26:57.996 --> 00:27:00.686 A:middle
as many interesting alternatives
as you can come up with.

00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:05.746 A:middle
And again you can do that
by organizing your content

00:27:05.746 --> 00:27:08.416 A:middle
into different layouts,
playing with text size,

00:27:08.416 --> 00:27:09.696 A:middle
color, weight, and font.

00:27:10.566 --> 00:27:13.676 A:middle
Experimenting with proportions
of your content, increasing

00:27:13.676 --> 00:27:14.576 A:middle
and decreasing the amount

00:27:14.576 --> 00:27:16.066 A:middle
of information that's
on the screen.

00:27:16.066 --> 00:27:19.736 A:middle
Doing 180s and pushing
ideas to extremes.

00:27:20.206 --> 00:27:21.406 A:middle
And considering different ways

00:27:21.836 --> 00:27:23.156 A:middle
of navigating through
your content.

00:27:23.686 --> 00:27:26.056 A:middle
So the next question is,

00:27:26.476 --> 00:27:30.046 A:middle
will any of these designs
actually work for our app?

00:27:30.206 --> 00:27:31.326 A:middle
We don't know yet.

00:27:32.076 --> 00:27:35.026 A:middle
This is a step when
you and your team get

00:27:35.076 --> 00:27:36.946 A:middle
to actually judge your designs.

00:27:37.136 --> 00:27:38.256 A:middle
This can be the fun part.

00:27:39.076 --> 00:27:40.896 A:middle
So you want to set aside
your ego and your pride

00:27:40.896 --> 00:27:43.226 A:middle
and forget all the time you
spent drawing your mockups.

00:27:43.626 --> 00:27:46.366 A:middle
And instead pretend you're a
third party whose job it is

00:27:46.716 --> 00:27:49.796 A:middle
to evaluate and critique your
designs to find their strengths

00:27:49.796 --> 00:27:51.846 A:middle
and weaknesses, and
find the best one.

00:27:52.636 --> 00:27:57.306 A:middle
So to do that you have to
scrutinize each options

00:27:57.476 --> 00:27:59.246 A:middle
and ask some tricky questions.

00:28:00.406 --> 00:28:04.226 A:middle
Things like, how well
does the design serve your

00:28:04.226 --> 00:28:05.216 A:middle
audience's goals?

00:28:05.626 --> 00:28:07.886 A:middle
How well does it address
your own app goals?

00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:10.386 A:middle
And does it fit the
definition of your app?

00:28:11.196 --> 00:28:14.616 A:middle
Does the design provide people
with the right information?

00:28:15.016 --> 00:28:16.856 A:middle
Is there enough detail
to take action?

00:28:17.396 --> 00:28:18.016 A:middle
Is it readable?

00:28:18.616 --> 00:28:21.136 A:middle
Is the design intuitive?

00:28:21.396 --> 00:28:24.416 A:middle
Are you using interface controls
that people are familiar with?

00:28:24.916 --> 00:28:28.106 A:middle
And are you using terminology
your audience will understand

00:28:28.156 --> 00:28:30.046 A:middle
given their context
and experience.

00:28:30.476 --> 00:28:33.696 A:middle
And finally, does the
design feel right?

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:36.486 A:middle
Even if it meets all
the other criteria,

00:28:36.556 --> 00:28:38.376 A:middle
and it's objectively
a good design,

00:28:38.706 --> 00:28:40.276 A:middle
does it feel the
way you want it to?

00:28:40.276 --> 00:28:43.296 A:middle
Does it have the personality and
the appearance that you want?

00:28:43.296 --> 00:28:45.226 A:middle
That's just as important
as everything else.

00:28:46.936 --> 00:28:48.926 A:middle
These questions are
all very subjective.

00:28:49.336 --> 00:28:51.426 A:middle
And you will most likely
get into disagreements

00:28:51.426 --> 00:28:54.676 A:middle
with your teammates and even
yourself about the answers.

00:28:54.906 --> 00:28:56.676 A:middle
But asking these
questions and trying

00:28:56.676 --> 00:29:00.476 A:middle
to answer them honestly
will really help lead you

00:28:56.676 --> 00:29:00.476 A:middle
to answer them honestly
will really help lead you

00:29:00.476 --> 00:29:02.836 A:middle
to the right design.

00:29:02.996 --> 00:29:05.196 A:middle
So to demonstrate what
we're talking about Jon

00:29:05.196 --> 00:29:08.746 A:middle
and I are going to now critique
our own designs in front of all

00:29:08.746 --> 00:29:11.896 A:middle
of you, to find the one that
we thinks works the best.

00:29:12.906 --> 00:29:16.186 A:middle
So let's take a second
and just consider them.

00:29:16.226 --> 00:29:18.936 A:middle
All right what do you think Jon?

00:29:19.716 --> 00:29:22.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Looking at them side by
side, it's a little bit obvious

00:29:22.116 --> 00:29:25.016 A:middle
that some are better than others
so I think we can just go ahead

00:29:25.216 --> 00:29:26.596 A:middle
and eliminate a couple
right now.

00:29:26.766 --> 00:29:26.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:29:28.136 --> 00:29:29.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's get rid of A,
you know the first one.

00:29:29.946 --> 00:29:32.306 A:middle
It's pretty good, but it's
not as good as the other ones.

00:29:32.506 --> 00:29:33.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:29:33.416 --> 00:29:34.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's get rid of D,

00:29:34.616 --> 00:29:36.476 A:middle
it doesn't have any photos,
that's wort of weird.

00:29:36.636 --> 00:29:36.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:29:36.886 --> 00:29:38.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; A food app, we need photos.

00:29:39.026 --> 00:29:42.226 A:middle
Let's also get rid of E.

00:29:42.226 --> 00:29:44.136 A:middle
Yeah that one has
too many photos.

00:29:44.656 --> 00:29:46.976 A:middle
It feels so crowded
and you can't even see

00:29:46.976 --> 00:29:47.836 A:middle
that much information.

00:29:48.426 --> 00:29:51.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; True. I think we
can get rid of F also.

00:29:51.326 --> 00:29:52.886 A:middle
It has a little bit
more information,

00:29:52.886 --> 00:29:55.176 A:middle
but I think the visual layout
is maybe a little too busy

00:29:55.596 --> 00:29:57.486 A:middle
and the entree names are getting
cut off that's not great.

00:29:57.786 --> 00:29:58.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That's a good point.

00:29:58.316 --> 00:30:00.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I think we can get rid
of option I, the proportions

00:29:58.316 --> 00:30:00.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I think we can get rid
of option I, the proportions

00:30:00.886 --> 00:30:03.436 A:middle
of those photos are
kind of interesting,

00:30:03.436 --> 00:30:05.956 A:middle
but you can't really see
enough of the food to know

00:30:06.066 --> 00:30:06.936 A:middle
if it looks good or not.

00:30:07.276 --> 00:30:07.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:30:07.576 --> 00:30:10.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And then option L, even
though I love the big photo,

00:30:10.546 --> 00:30:12.126 A:middle
I think paging through 12

00:30:12.126 --> 00:30:14.526 A:middle
or 15 different entrees
is probably just going

00:30:14.526 --> 00:30:16.766 A:middle
to be too tedious so I think we
should get rid of that one too.

00:30:16.766 --> 00:30:17.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I agree.

00:30:18.096 --> 00:30:20.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right now we're down
to six, that's good progress.

00:30:22.876 --> 00:30:24.146 A:middle
All right [laughter].

00:30:26.586 --> 00:30:28.336 A:middle
Didn't take very long at all.

00:30:28.336 --> 00:30:30.646 A:middle
All right so let's look
at the rest of them

00:30:30.646 --> 00:30:31.866 A:middle
in a little more detail.

00:30:31.946 --> 00:30:34.856 A:middle
So between these two,
they're actually very similar,

00:30:34.856 --> 00:30:36.116 A:middle
they're very functionally
similar.

00:30:36.116 --> 00:30:39.986 A:middle
I would say that maybe option B
is a little more conventional,

00:30:40.046 --> 00:30:44.546 A:middle
maybe more what people expect
from a menu on an iPhone.

00:30:44.546 --> 00:30:46.966 A:middle
And I actually like the
edge-to-edge photos.

00:30:46.966 --> 00:30:47.686 A:middle
I think that's a nice look.

00:30:48.486 --> 00:30:50.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You know I actually
like option C.

00:30:50.006 --> 00:30:51.726 A:middle
It's a little bit
more interesting.

00:30:51.946 --> 00:30:54.586 A:middle
I like how the topography
is really thin.

00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:56.376 A:middle
I think that's really hip now.

00:30:57.096 --> 00:30:58.806 A:middle
It's also cool how all

00:30:58.806 --> 00:31:01.496 A:middle
of the information is
aligned on the left.

00:30:58.806 --> 00:31:01.496 A:middle
of the information is
aligned on the left.

00:31:01.616 --> 00:31:04.556 A:middle
It's really each to just scan
down and see names and prices.

00:31:05.176 --> 00:31:07.936 A:middle
And I sort of like the
feel of it being more open

00:31:07.936 --> 00:31:10.896 A:middle
and feeling a little
bit more fresh.

00:31:11.106 --> 00:31:13.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think, yeah
those are good points.

00:31:13.246 --> 00:31:13.536 A:middle
Thank you.

00:31:13.536 --> 00:31:13.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:31:14.036 --> 00:31:14.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You've convinced me.

00:31:14.896 --> 00:31:16.906 A:middle
All right let's get
rid of option B.

00:31:18.206 --> 00:31:22.366 A:middle
This is totally ad lib
by the way [laughter].

00:31:22.606 --> 00:31:24.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay these two look
pretty similar as well,

00:31:24.906 --> 00:31:26.276 A:middle
they both have edge-to-edge
photos.

00:31:26.926 --> 00:31:29.376 A:middle
G has more of a grid layout,

00:31:29.376 --> 00:31:31.296 A:middle
while H looks more
like a bento box.

00:31:32.116 --> 00:31:34.386 A:middle
I really like, I really like H.

00:31:34.386 --> 00:31:36.536 A:middle
You know there's a lot of
different sizes and variety.

00:31:36.746 --> 00:31:37.566 A:middle
It feels really fun.

00:31:39.416 --> 00:31:42.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [Sigh] Yeah H looks cool,
but I think it has a fatal slaw,

00:31:42.256 --> 00:31:44.266 A:middle
which is that some of these
entrees look more important

00:31:44.266 --> 00:31:44.686 A:middle
than others.

00:31:44.686 --> 00:31:46.126 A:middle
Like, we really want you

00:31:46.126 --> 00:31:47.966 A:middle
to buy grilled mahi-mahi
with this design.

00:31:48.296 --> 00:31:49.316 A:middle
And that's not really the case.

00:31:49.316 --> 00:31:50.626 A:middle
These should all
be equal options.

00:31:50.736 --> 00:31:53.996 A:middle
I think if we like this style,
I think G does a better job

00:31:53.996 --> 00:31:55.846 A:middle
with balancing this
edge-to-edge look

00:31:55.846 --> 00:31:59.496 A:middle
with the actual functional
intent of the app.

00:31:59.786 --> 00:32:01.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I still really like
H though [laughter],

00:31:59.786 --> 00:32:01.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I still really like
H though [laughter],

00:32:01.886 --> 00:32:03.976 A:middle
but I think you make
good points.

00:32:04.536 --> 00:32:04.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:32:05.046 --> 00:32:05.756 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I think we should go with G.

00:32:05.756 --> 00:32:06.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right fair enough.

00:32:11.046 --> 00:32:13.076 A:middle
All right so between these
two, I actually really like J,

00:32:13.076 --> 00:32:15.736 A:middle
like I've said the edge-to-edge
photo thing is doing it for me.

00:32:16.086 --> 00:32:18.966 A:middle
And I love that this reminds
me of like a food magazine,

00:32:18.966 --> 00:32:20.266 A:middle
which I think is a
really cool style.

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:23.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Ryan, we are not designing
a food magazine here,

00:32:23.946 --> 00:32:25.736 A:middle
we are designing a delivery app.

00:32:25.736 --> 00:32:27.046 A:middle
You can't even see
the words in J.

00:32:27.126 --> 00:32:30.576 A:middle
I like how K has a better
balance of photos and text.

00:32:31.086 --> 00:32:34.456 A:middle
Because it just seems more
relevant, and more appetizing.

00:32:34.456 --> 00:32:36.616 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right I see
what you mean.

00:32:36.926 --> 00:32:40.006 A:middle
You gave me H, so
I'll give you K.

00:32:40.216 --> 00:32:40.546 A:middle
All right.

00:32:40.866 --> 00:32:42.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay, good.

00:32:42.576 --> 00:32:43.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Compromise.

00:32:44.516 --> 00:32:47.596 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:48.096 --> 00:32:49.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right now we're
down to our top three,

00:32:49.886 --> 00:32:52.036 A:middle
what do you think?

00:32:52.036 --> 00:32:53.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; They look pretty good,
but you know seeing them side

00:32:53.946 --> 00:32:56.066 A:middle
by side, I think it's
sort of obvious now

00:32:56.066 --> 00:32:57.656 A:middle
that G is not that great.

00:32:58.056 --> 00:33:00.876 A:middle
These descriptions are
actually really useful to sort

00:32:58.056 --> 00:33:00.876 A:middle
These descriptions are
actually really useful to sort

00:33:01.256 --> 00:33:03.466 A:middle
of tell people what the food is.

00:33:03.996 --> 00:33:06.176 A:middle
And G just seems really
lacking in that regard.

00:33:06.926 --> 00:33:10.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Seeing them all
together, I think you're right.

00:33:10.456 --> 00:33:12.506 A:middle
Even though I love the
edge-to-edge photo I think

00:33:12.506 --> 00:33:13.416 A:middle
having the descriptions,

00:33:13.416 --> 00:33:15.676 A:middle
the more information really
makes a better experience

00:33:15.676 --> 00:33:16.886 A:middle
so I guess we'll get rid of G.

00:33:17.196 --> 00:33:17.446 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:33:18.146 --> 00:33:19.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right now
we're down to C and K

00:33:20.146 --> 00:33:22.236 A:middle
in just a few minutes
we've gotten

00:33:22.336 --> 00:33:23.946 A:middle
down to just two options
which is pretty cool.

00:33:24.956 --> 00:33:27.106 A:middle
These two are also very
functionally similar.

00:33:27.726 --> 00:33:29.066 A:middle
They both look great I think.

00:33:29.826 --> 00:33:33.446 A:middle
They do have pretty
different feel between them.

00:33:33.486 --> 00:33:36.306 A:middle
I don't actually, I
don't have a favorite

00:33:36.306 --> 00:33:37.206 A:middle
of these two, how about you?

00:33:37.936 --> 00:33:41.456 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Well [laughter], oh
I can't tell either.

00:33:41.456 --> 00:33:42.976 A:middle
They both look pretty good.

00:33:43.296 --> 00:33:43.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:33:43.546 --> 00:33:45.626 A:middle
Well we were actually
worried it might come to this.

00:33:46.166 --> 00:33:48.226 A:middle
And so maybe all
of you can help us.

00:33:48.646 --> 00:33:53.166 A:middle
So given all of the, now you've
seen us critique our own designs

00:33:53.166 --> 00:33:56.026 A:middle
and given the goals and the
criteria we've been considering,

00:33:56.026 --> 00:33:58.406 A:middle
by round of applause, please

00:33:58.736 --> 00:34:00.836 A:middle
who thinks option C
is the better design?

00:33:58.736 --> 00:34:00.836 A:middle
who thinks option C
is the better design?

00:34:01.516 --> 00:34:06.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:34:07.046 --> 00:34:08.545 A:middle
Okay now, who thinks option
K is the better design?

00:34:09.516 --> 00:34:12.576 A:middle
[ Cheering ]

00:34:13.076 --> 00:34:15.766 A:middle
All right well I think
K pretty clearly won,

00:34:15.766 --> 00:34:17.146 A:middle
which is pretty convenient
for us [laughter].

00:34:17.696 --> 00:34:23.036 A:middle
All right so our
congratulations, option K.

00:34:23.036 --> 00:34:27.226 A:middle
Good job. So we've determined
as a large design team here

00:34:27.226 --> 00:34:30.985 A:middle
that option K is the
best combination maybe

00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:32.846 A:middle
of functionality, efficiency,

00:34:32.846 --> 00:34:34.696 A:middle
and the general feel we'd
like the app to have.

00:34:35.606 --> 00:34:37.866 A:middle
So now have we actually
found the right design?

00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:41.835 A:middle
Well, we're on our way, right,
but one screen is not an app.

00:34:42.315 --> 00:34:45.226 A:middle
We now actually have to figure
out how this thing works.

00:34:45.686 --> 00:34:46.786 A:middle
So to tell you more about that,

00:34:46.786 --> 00:34:47.815 A:middle
I'm going to give
this back to Jon.

00:34:49.976 --> 00:34:50.286 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you [applause].

00:34:53.286 --> 00:34:54.976 A:middle
We need to design a workflow.

00:34:55.516 --> 00:34:58.356 A:middle
A workflow is a set of steps
it takes to complete a task.

00:34:59.096 --> 00:35:02.436 A:middle
In my case the task
is to order food.

00:34:59.096 --> 00:35:02.436 A:middle
In my case the task
is to order food.

00:35:02.986 --> 00:35:07.266 A:middle
So let's go back to the
design we just choose.

00:35:07.806 --> 00:35:12.196 A:middle
I think I'll take my
advice from before and start

00:35:12.196 --> 00:35:13.136 A:middle
with what I know here.

00:35:13.706 --> 00:35:15.506 A:middle
I don't know much about
what this is supposed to do,

00:35:15.506 --> 00:35:18.266 A:middle
but I do one thing,
that if I tap on one

00:35:18.266 --> 00:35:20.906 A:middle
of those entrees I probably
should see more information

00:35:20.906 --> 00:35:21.356 A:middle
about that.

00:35:21.356 --> 00:35:24.696 A:middle
So I'll go ahead and I'll
design a detail screen.

00:35:25.536 --> 00:35:27.406 A:middle
And maybe it looks
something like this.

00:35:28.756 --> 00:35:31.356 A:middle
Okay. So now that I'm here,

00:35:31.356 --> 00:35:33.196 A:middle
I probably need a
way to order food.

00:35:33.866 --> 00:35:35.786 A:middle
So I'll put in an Order button.

00:35:36.416 --> 00:35:39.076 A:middle
And maybe it will just go on the
bottom of the screen for now.

00:35:39.916 --> 00:35:40.306 A:middle
Excellent.

00:35:40.776 --> 00:35:44.016 A:middle
And now what happens if I
tap on this Order button?

00:35:44.816 --> 00:35:46.226 A:middle
Well, I don't know.

00:35:47.486 --> 00:35:48.746 A:middle
Maybe I'll just finish the order

00:35:48.956 --> 00:35:50.546 A:middle
and let the user know
that they're done.

00:35:51.556 --> 00:35:53.206 A:middle
So, I've designed a workflow.

00:35:53.796 --> 00:35:56.286 A:middle
It looks pretty good.

00:35:56.716 --> 00:35:59.926 A:middle
I think it gets the job
done of ordering food.

00:36:00.476 --> 00:36:02.466 A:middle
But you know now
that I look at it,

00:36:02.566 --> 00:36:03.796 A:middle
I think there's some problems.

00:36:04.076 --> 00:36:06.686 A:middle
It's actually missing a
little bit of functionality

00:36:06.936 --> 00:36:08.366 A:middle
that we talked about before.

00:36:08.636 --> 00:36:12.846 A:middle
You can't actually change order
details, where it's going to,

00:36:12.846 --> 00:36:15.446 A:middle
or when it's going to come,
so that's a little bit weird.

00:36:15.566 --> 00:36:19.746 A:middle
And now that I look at it, the
commitment is really abrupt.

00:36:20.166 --> 00:36:23.356 A:middle
After I hit the order button,
I've already spent $10.

00:36:23.466 --> 00:36:25.156 A:middle
There's probably
a rule somewhere

00:36:25.156 --> 00:36:26.366 A:middle
that says you shouldn't do that.

00:36:27.096 --> 00:36:29.066 A:middle
So I think there's
a lot of things

00:36:29.066 --> 00:36:30.646 A:middle
that maybe this workflow
could do better

00:36:30.646 --> 00:36:31.646 A:middle
so let's try that again.

00:36:32.096 --> 00:36:37.536 A:middle
So, in a couple apps I've
seen the shopping cart model.

00:36:37.536 --> 00:36:39.366 A:middle
So I think I'm going to
borrow that for this one.

00:36:39.866 --> 00:36:43.066 A:middle
So in the upper right hand
corner now there's a shopping

00:36:43.066 --> 00:36:43.716 A:middle
cart icon.

00:36:44.226 --> 00:36:47.936 A:middle
And now if I tap in food
there's an Add to Cart button.

00:36:48.616 --> 00:36:50.536 A:middle
And now I could tap that,

00:36:50.536 --> 00:36:52.226 A:middle
the button will say it's
been added to the cart.

00:36:52.646 --> 00:36:54.606 A:middle
And my icon will
change to let me know

00:36:54.606 --> 00:36:55.376 A:middle
that there's something in it.

00:36:56.396 --> 00:36:58.046 A:middle
It seems like a pretty
conventional behavior,

00:36:58.046 --> 00:36:58.926 A:middle
so that's really nice.

00:36:58.926 --> 00:37:00.176 A:middle
I think people will
know how to use that.

00:36:58.926 --> 00:37:00.176 A:middle
I think people will
know how to use that.

00:37:00.866 --> 00:37:05.836 A:middle
And now if I tap on the shopping
cart icon I can show the user a

00:37:05.836 --> 00:37:07.016 A:middle
summary of their order.

00:37:07.176 --> 00:37:11.086 A:middle
And from here they could maybe
change the options as well as,

00:37:11.086 --> 00:37:13.226 A:middle
to get a confirmation
that they're

00:37:13.226 --> 00:37:15.616 A:middle
about to spend 11.68 for food.

00:37:16.436 --> 00:37:19.746 A:middle
And now if they tap Place
Order, I can show them

00:37:19.746 --> 00:37:23.986 A:middle
that the orders complete and
give them information about it.

00:37:24.276 --> 00:37:26.366 A:middle
So, now my work flow
looks something like this.

00:37:27.146 --> 00:37:29.336 A:middle
It addresses the problems
I mentioned before.

00:37:29.836 --> 00:37:33.106 A:middle
It lets me know the
details of my order,

00:37:33.106 --> 00:37:36.056 A:middle
and it does not make the
ordering feel too abrupt.

00:37:36.056 --> 00:37:38.026 A:middle
It lets the user know
what's happening,

00:37:38.026 --> 00:37:39.046 A:middle
so I think that's really nice.

00:37:40.566 --> 00:37:42.936 A:middle
But you know I don't think this
workflow is that good either,

00:37:43.306 --> 00:37:46.026 A:middle
it's actually a whole lot of
steps for something as simple

00:37:46.026 --> 00:37:46.966 A:middle
as ordering a sandwich.

00:37:47.316 --> 00:37:48.706 A:middle
So I think we can
make it a lot shorter.

00:37:48.706 --> 00:37:52.306 A:middle
And I actually noticed,
having done this twice now

00:37:52.306 --> 00:37:55.586 A:middle
that the menu screen
does a pretty good job

00:37:55.586 --> 00:37:58.426 A:middle
of giving people
information about the food,

00:37:58.426 --> 00:38:01.306 A:middle
and they might not have
to go to the detail screen

00:37:58.426 --> 00:38:01.306 A:middle
and they might not have
to go to the detail screen

00:38:01.306 --> 00:38:03.406 A:middle
to actually figure out
if they want to order it.

00:38:03.736 --> 00:38:06.826 A:middle
So maybe the user can determine

00:38:06.826 --> 00:38:09.116 A:middle
to order the food right
from the menu screen.

00:38:09.526 --> 00:38:10.706 A:middle
So let's try this again,

00:38:10.706 --> 00:38:11.976 A:middle
let's try to make
this workflow shorter.

00:38:14.176 --> 00:38:18.376 A:middle
So here, I put the Buy buttons
right on the menu screen,

00:38:18.456 --> 00:38:19.916 A:middle
because that seems like
enough information.

00:38:19.916 --> 00:38:22.496 A:middle
And now if the user taps
on one of those buttons,

00:38:23.656 --> 00:38:26.396 A:middle
maybe we keep the shopping cart
model, but instead of an icon

00:38:26.396 --> 00:38:27.866 A:middle
in the corner, it's
now this little tray

00:38:27.866 --> 00:38:28.836 A:middle
that comes up on bottom.

00:38:29.626 --> 00:38:32.306 A:middle
Here, I could actually show
information about the order,

00:38:32.306 --> 00:38:34.736 A:middle
and even let them
finish ordering it right

00:38:34.736 --> 00:38:35.516 A:middle
from the menu screen.

00:38:36.346 --> 00:38:38.906 A:middle
If they want to I guess, they
could just still swipe it up

00:38:38.906 --> 00:38:40.706 A:middle
and see the full
details of their orders

00:38:40.706 --> 00:38:41.736 A:middle
and the different options.

00:38:42.346 --> 00:38:45.206 A:middle
But I think for the most part,
this might be enough information

00:38:45.206 --> 00:38:47.246 A:middle
for someone to figure
out if they want

00:38:47.246 --> 00:38:48.016 A:middle
to complete this order.

00:38:49.166 --> 00:38:52.286 A:middle
And I could actually extend
this further, if the user taps

00:38:52.286 --> 00:38:57.046 A:middle
on the Order button, I could
use the same little tray

00:38:57.396 --> 00:38:59.466 A:middle
and show the confirmation
status.

00:39:01.756 --> 00:39:03.996 A:middle
So now, the workflow
looks something like this.

00:39:04.786 --> 00:39:07.136 A:middle
It's three steps, but
it feels a lot shorter

00:39:07.136 --> 00:39:09.326 A:middle
because all that's
happening on the menu screen.

00:39:09.966 --> 00:39:13.996 A:middle
And it still has all
of the functionality

00:39:13.996 --> 00:39:17.796 A:middle
as the previous design, but
now all of that's optional

00:39:17.796 --> 00:39:19.656 A:middle
under the tray rather
than forcing it

00:39:19.656 --> 00:39:21.176 A:middle
to be a mandatory
step for the user.

00:39:21.516 --> 00:39:24.496 A:middle
So that's really nice.

00:39:24.496 --> 00:39:27.166 A:middle
So I think this workflow
is pretty good.

00:39:27.196 --> 00:39:29.216 A:middle
I think it gets the job
done of ordering food

00:39:29.216 --> 00:39:30.506 A:middle
and I think it does
it very quickly.

00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:35.196 A:middle
Notice how to design this,
I used the same principles

00:39:35.196 --> 00:39:36.306 A:middle
that we talked about before.

00:39:36.306 --> 00:39:39.986 A:middle
I started with what I knew and
then I evaluated and iterated

00:39:39.986 --> 00:39:41.816 A:middle
on all my designs until I ended

00:39:41.816 --> 00:39:44.456 A:middle
up with something
I was happy with.

00:39:44.456 --> 00:39:46.586 A:middle
So now to wrap things up, let
me give this back to Ryan.

00:39:47.516 --> 00:39:51.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:39:52.046 --> 00:39:52.806 A:middle
Thank you, Jon.

00:39:52.976 --> 00:39:54.236 A:middle
I can't wait to use
our pretend app.

00:39:54.236 --> 00:39:57.996 A:middle
All right so to wrap up, we
only have a couple minutes.

00:39:58.326 --> 00:40:01.176 A:middle
I hope we've been able to convey
a few key points to you today.

00:39:58.326 --> 00:40:01.176 A:middle
I hope we've been able to convey
a few key points to you today.

00:40:01.646 --> 00:40:04.326 A:middle
First, good design is not easy.

00:40:04.596 --> 00:40:07.776 A:middle
It can be a lot of fun,
but it takes time, energy,

00:40:07.846 --> 00:40:09.186 A:middle
and thoughtful deliberation.

00:40:09.946 --> 00:40:12.096 A:middle
But by using the methods
we've shared with you today,

00:40:12.096 --> 00:40:13.476 A:middle
it can be a little bit easier.

00:40:14.416 --> 00:40:16.806 A:middle
If you're trying to figure out
what the heck are we making?

00:40:17.606 --> 00:40:20.546 A:middle
Define your audience's goals
and your own app goals.

00:40:20.606 --> 00:40:22.356 A:middle
And then use those to
choose the features

00:40:22.626 --> 00:40:24.146 A:middle
that best serve everyone's
needs.

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:27.006 A:middle
If you know what
you want to make,

00:40:27.006 --> 00:40:28.646 A:middle
but don't know what
the UI should look

00:40:28.646 --> 00:40:30.476 A:middle
or feel like, just
start drawing.

00:40:31.056 --> 00:40:32.916 A:middle
Start with what you do
know and build from there.

00:40:32.916 --> 00:40:34.746 A:middle
It's okay if you don't have
the whole system figured

00:40:34.746 --> 00:40:35.586 A:middle
out ahead of time.

00:40:36.206 --> 00:40:38.956 A:middle
And it's our completely unbiased
opinion, but try using Keynote,

00:40:38.986 --> 00:40:41.096 A:middle
we think you might like it.

00:40:41.406 --> 00:40:44.486 A:middle
And finally to find the right
design, try lots of ideas.

00:40:45.386 --> 00:40:47.116 A:middle
Don't settle for
your first concept,

00:40:47.426 --> 00:40:49.226 A:middle
or what might be good enough.

00:40:50.056 --> 00:40:52.126 A:middle
Then critique your
designs to determine

00:40:52.126 --> 00:40:55.746 A:middle
which options best suits
your customer goals

00:40:55.746 --> 00:40:56.646 A:middle
and your app goals.

00:40:57.146 --> 00:41:00.346 A:middle
Keep iterating and evaluating
until the design feels right.

00:40:57.146 --> 00:41:00.346 A:middle
Keep iterating and evaluating
until the design feels right.

00:41:01.856 --> 00:41:03.786 A:middle
So, we hope you'll
take these techniques

00:41:03.786 --> 00:41:05.086 A:middle
and methods back
to your own work.

00:41:05.416 --> 00:41:09.026 A:middle
Give yourself the time
to explore, iterate

00:41:09.026 --> 00:41:10.166 A:middle
and critique your designs.

00:41:11.216 --> 00:41:13.766 A:middle
We think you'll find
it was worth it.

00:41:14.676 --> 00:41:16.486 A:middle
