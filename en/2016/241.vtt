[ Music ]

00:00:20.346 --> 00:00:23.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. My name is Ellis
Verosub, and I'm responsible

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.726 A:middle
for public transit
in Apple Maps.

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.086 A:middle
Our goal here at Apple is always

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:30.596 A:middle
to create the best possible
customer experience.

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:32.996 A:middle
We believe that design
is not just

00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:35.396 A:middle
about how something
looks but how it works.

00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:38.776 A:middle
Great experiences are
intuitive and seamless.

00:00:39.326 --> 00:00:42.486 A:middle
In this talk, I'd like to
explore how these ideas apply

00:00:42.486 --> 00:00:44.086 A:middle
to transit in Apple Maps.

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:45.836 A:middle
But first, I'd like to start

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:50.886 A:middle
by giving you an
overview of our product.

00:00:50.976 --> 00:00:55.156 A:middle
Transit launched in September
2015 as part of iOS 9

00:00:55.336 --> 00:00:57.016 A:middle
and Mac OS X, El Capitan.

00:00:57.016 --> 00:01:02.126 A:middle
As of today, it is available
in 21 cities around the world

00:00:57.016 --> 00:01:02.126 A:middle
As of today, it is available
in 21 cities around the world

00:01:02.126 --> 00:01:04.385 A:middle
as well as over 300
cities in China.

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:09.756 A:middle
We use transit schedule data
from over 250 transit agencies.

00:01:10.996 --> 00:01:12.286 A:middle
Here's a bit of a fun fact.

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:16.576 A:middle
To date, we've mapped more
than 16,000 station entrances.

00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:19.556 A:middle
Next, I'd like to
give you an overview

00:01:19.656 --> 00:01:21.856 A:middle
of the four key features
of our product.

00:01:22.456 --> 00:01:26.586 A:middle
The first is a beautiful
transit map.

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.926 A:middle
Roads and other driving-related
elements have been dimmed

00:01:29.926 --> 00:01:32.316 A:middle
out while transit
lines and key terminus

00:01:32.316 --> 00:01:34.276 A:middle
and transfer stations
are emphasized.

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:40.656 A:middle
The second feature
is a departure board

00:01:40.656 --> 00:01:43.976 A:middle
for each station showing each
line that services the station.

00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:52.696 A:middle
The third is detailed point
to point directions along

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:54.726 A:middle
with a guided navigation
experience.

00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:01.236 A:middle
Finally, we show
realtime advisories

00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:01.236 A:middle
Finally, we show
realtime advisories

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:04.646 A:middle
and even modify our recommended
directions in response

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:07.556 A:middle
to planned service changes
or unplanned incidents.

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:13.886 A:middle
Our goal is to provide
a great experience

00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:15.566 A:middle
in each city we support.

00:02:16.296 --> 00:02:17.676 A:middle
So how do we do that?

00:02:17.996 --> 00:02:21.436 A:middle
We start with agency schedule
data, but we don't stop there.

00:02:21.936 --> 00:02:23.246 A:middle
We collect additional data

00:02:23.246 --> 00:02:25.566 A:middle
through original research
and field surveys.

00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:28.486 A:middle
Then we add in a layer
of curation to surprise

00:02:28.486 --> 00:02:29.916 A:middle
and delight our customers.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:33.556 A:middle
Our goal is that at every
moment customers should be able

00:02:33.556 --> 00:02:36.466 A:middle
to match the instruction we're
giving them to what they see

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:38.636 A:middle
in the real world around them.

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:41.416 A:middle
Gathering these details
takes a long time.

00:02:41.636 --> 00:02:44.766 A:middle
But as Steve Jobs once
said, "Details matter.

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:46.896 A:middle
It's worth waiting
to get it right".

00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:52.136 A:middle
Here are some examples
of additional data

00:02:52.136 --> 00:02:53.616 A:middle
that we collect ourselves.

00:02:56.106 --> 00:02:57.976 A:middle
Station entrances and exits.

00:03:00.126 --> 00:03:02.936 A:middle
Station footprints or
the outlines of stations.

00:03:04.876 --> 00:03:06.036 A:middle
Agency signage.

00:03:06.426 --> 00:03:11.436 A:middle
And the real world
path of transit lines

00:03:11.516 --> 00:03:14.316 A:middle
by which I mean the path
that trains and buses

00:03:14.316 --> 00:03:20.806 A:middle
and ferries actually
take in the real world.

00:03:21.056 --> 00:03:23.696 A:middle
This example shows a
station entrance in London.

00:03:24.126 --> 00:03:26.976 A:middle
We've individually surveys
every entrance not just

00:03:26.976 --> 00:03:28.746 A:middle
for location but also type.

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:31.996 A:middle
Stairs, escalator,
elevator, and so forth.

00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:38.556 A:middle
Here is that same entrance
represented on our transit map.

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:41.106 A:middle
You can also see the
station outline here.

00:03:41.856 --> 00:03:44.946 A:middle
This is really helpful in
terms of finding your way into

00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:46.216 A:middle
and out of train stations.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:52.486 A:middle
Stations have different names
for exits and entrances.

00:03:52.856 --> 00:03:55.506 A:middle
From the outside, the entrance
might not even have a name.

00:03:55.706 --> 00:03:58.996 A:middle
But from the inside, there's
often a number or code.

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:03.476 A:middle
We show that number
or code on our map

00:04:03.586 --> 00:04:05.346 A:middle
so that you can be
confident you are going

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:06.316 A:middle
in the correct direction.

00:04:10.476 --> 00:04:14.796 A:middle
We try to match agency signage
as closely as possible not just

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:18.255 A:middle
in terms of the signage itself,
but also what gets displayed

00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:19.555 A:middle
where and in what order.

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:25.446 A:middle
Again, you see that
reflected on our map.

00:04:29.716 --> 00:04:32.486 A:middle
Finally, something that
is very important to us is

00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:33.766 A:middle
that the transit lines shown

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:35.886 A:middle
on the map follow
their actual paths.

00:04:36.386 --> 00:04:40.006 A:middle
Many iconic transit maps such as
the London underground map are

00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:43.526 A:middle
schematic, not representative of
the actual path the lines take.

00:04:44.056 --> 00:04:47.506 A:middle
However, with a digital map on
a mobile device, it's important

00:04:47.506 --> 00:04:50.966 A:middle
that your location position as
reflected on the map matches

00:04:50.966 --> 00:04:52.696 A:middle
up with the line you're
actually traveling on.

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:54.586 A:middle
This builds confidence

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:57.286 A:middle
in the directions the
customer has been given.

00:05:01.056 --> 00:05:03.536 A:middle
After we've gathered all
of this additional data,

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:05.796 A:middle
we go even deeper
into the experience.

00:05:06.046 --> 00:05:09.696 A:middle
Our belief is that every city
has a unique transit culture,

00:05:10.016 --> 00:05:11.326 A:middle
and we try to understand

00:05:11.326 --> 00:05:13.726 A:middle
and respect this culture
reflecting it back

00:05:13.726 --> 00:05:14.756 A:middle
at our customers.

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:16.766 A:middle
In the next few slides,

00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:19.026 A:middle
I'm going to dive
into a few examples.

00:05:22.286 --> 00:05:25.286 A:middle
Boarding instructions vary
from system to system.

00:05:26.286 --> 00:05:29.656 A:middle
For example, in London
you board lines.

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:32.906 A:middle
Whereas in New York
you board trains.

00:05:33.896 --> 00:05:36.016 A:middle
You don't take the
Victoria train in London

00:05:36.146 --> 00:05:37.686 A:middle
or the A Line in New York.

00:05:37.816 --> 00:05:39.236 A:middle
That's not a local convention.

00:05:40.476 --> 00:05:42.086 A:middle
Sometimes the line name matters,

00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:44.366 A:middle
but sometimes only the
system name matters.

00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:47.696 A:middle
Here in the Bay Area, for
example, you just take BART.

00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:52.226 A:middle
Sometimes the local convention
includes the type of vehicle,

00:05:52.396 --> 00:05:53.546 A:middle
sometimes it's assumed.

00:05:54.026 --> 00:05:57.016 A:middle
In Mexico City, we specify
that it's the Metro.

00:05:58.216 --> 00:05:59.716 A:middle
We capture these subtleties

00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:01.226 A:middle
because that allows
our customers

00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:01.226 A:middle
because that allows
our customers

00:06:01.226 --> 00:06:04.686 A:middle
to match what we're telling them
to the real world around them.

00:06:06.996 --> 00:06:08.556 A:middle
Here is a different example.

00:06:09.656 --> 00:06:12.196 A:middle
In New York, the MTA
doesn't list their lines

00:06:12.196 --> 00:06:13.306 A:middle
in alphabetical order.

00:06:13.676 --> 00:06:15.236 A:middle
Instead, they list
them by color.

00:06:15.636 --> 00:06:18.476 A:middle
A and C are blue,
B and D are orange.

00:06:21.646 --> 00:06:24.446 A:middle
You see the same ordering
reflected in our product.

00:06:29.276 --> 00:06:32.106 A:middle
Trams and street cars are
really the same type of vehicle,

00:06:32.466 --> 00:06:34.286 A:middle
but different cities
specifically refer

00:06:34.286 --> 00:06:35.596 A:middle
to one or the other.

00:06:35.806 --> 00:06:38.686 A:middle
For example, in Toronto,
you could tell a customer

00:06:38.686 --> 00:06:42.226 A:middle
to board the 510 Spadina Tram,
but that's not really correct.

00:06:42.506 --> 00:06:45.136 A:middle
Everyone calls it the
510 Spadina streetcar,

00:06:45.616 --> 00:06:48.756 A:middle
so that's what we
call it as well.

00:06:49.236 --> 00:06:55.296 A:middle
In Berlin, on the other
hand, you ride trams.

00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:01.166 A:middle
And that is reflected
in our experience.

00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:01.166 A:middle
And that is reflected
in our experience.

00:07:01.636 --> 00:07:06.056 A:middle
Here's another example.

00:07:06.616 --> 00:07:09.286 A:middle
In San Francisco, you
ride inbound and outbound.

00:07:09.776 --> 00:07:12.906 A:middle
Whereas in London or Toronto,
you go northbound, southbound,

00:07:12.906 --> 00:07:13.916 A:middle
eastbound, and westbound.

00:07:14.316 --> 00:07:20.346 A:middle
But in New York, you
go uptown and downtown.

00:07:20.446 --> 00:07:22.866 A:middle
Again, you see this
reflected in our app.

00:07:25.636 --> 00:07:27.046 A:middle
One final example.

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:30.486 A:middle
In Rio, the bus rapid transit
systems are very important.

00:07:31.056 --> 00:07:33.296 A:middle
In many ways, they are
the equals of the Metro

00:07:33.296 --> 00:07:34.546 A:middle
and commuter rail systems.

00:07:35.016 --> 00:07:37.716 A:middle
We raise the prominence of
these bus rapid transit lines

00:07:37.716 --> 00:07:40.076 A:middle
on our map to reflect
their importance.

00:07:40.586 --> 00:07:43.466 A:middle
That's the blue and orange lines

00:07:43.466 --> 00:07:45.176 A:middle
that you see in this
screen shot.

00:07:48.656 --> 00:07:50.556 A:middle
Here is how we build
up our feature.

00:07:51.296 --> 00:07:55.266 A:middle
We start with agency data for
schedules, but then we survey

00:07:55.326 --> 00:07:57.096 A:middle
to add additional curated data.

00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:59.626 A:middle
For example, station
entrances and line geometry

00:07:59.626 --> 00:08:00.766 A:middle
as we've previously seen.

00:07:59.626 --> 00:08:00.766 A:middle
as we've previously seen.

00:08:01.836 --> 00:08:03.366 A:middle
Then we customize the experience

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:05.806 A:middle
to respect the unique
culture of each city.

00:08:06.576 --> 00:08:09.576 A:middle
Finally, this is all
wrapped in our user interface

00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:11.696 A:middle
to bring delight
to our customers.

00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:16.976 A:middle
Now, I'd like to give
you a short demo.

00:08:25.106 --> 00:08:28.136 A:middle
Let's say you just flew into San
Francisco International Airport,

00:08:28.326 --> 00:08:31.486 A:middle
and you'd like directions
to Moscone West for WWDC.

00:08:32.395 --> 00:08:34.936 A:middle
First, you can see our
multiagency transit map.

00:08:35.326 --> 00:08:38.336 A:middle
As I mentioned, transit lines
are highlighted while roads

00:08:38.336 --> 00:08:38.885 A:middle
are dimmed.

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:43.166 A:middle
Now, we're going to
look at the departures

00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:44.376 A:middle
for Powell Street Station.

00:08:45.086 --> 00:08:48.056 A:middle
Powell Street is serviced
by both BART and Muni,

00:08:48.056 --> 00:08:50.416 A:middle
and you can see the upcoming
BART departures as well

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:51.896 A:middle
as the upcoming Muni departures.

00:09:00.086 --> 00:09:02.446 A:middle
Now, at the top I noticed
there was an advisory.

00:09:03.496 --> 00:09:04.556 A:middle
When I tap on details,

00:09:04.556 --> 00:09:07.366 A:middle
I see that Muni has some
service changed in effect,

00:09:07.366 --> 00:09:09.476 A:middle
and we are communicating
those service changes

00:09:09.476 --> 00:09:10.386 A:middle
to our customers.

00:09:17.836 --> 00:09:20.596 A:middle
You can zoom out to see
the entire transit network

00:09:20.596 --> 00:09:20.976 A:middle
of the Bay Area.

00:09:29.506 --> 00:09:32.036 A:middle
Or you can zoom in
to get more details.

00:09:35.336 --> 00:09:37.896 A:middle
The information density
and the lines

00:09:37.896 --> 00:09:40.046 A:middle
that we show changes
at each zoom.

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:43.756 A:middle
Now, some people may want
to have different choices.

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:46.156 A:middle
So, for example,
they may want to see

00:09:46.156 --> 00:09:47.556 A:middle
if a bus route is available.

00:09:48.096 --> 00:09:52.636 A:middle
In our product, you can select
the exact vehicles that you'd

00:09:52.636 --> 00:09:53.806 A:middle
like to use for your journey.

00:09:54.846 --> 00:09:56.856 A:middle
Here is a competing bus route.

00:09:57.916 --> 00:09:59.986 A:middle
Now, we didn't recommend
this because it takes longer.

00:10:00.486 --> 00:10:03.986 A:middle
But it's an option
that's available to you.

00:10:04.696 --> 00:10:08.536 A:middle
So let's go back to our
BART route and examine

00:10:08.536 --> 00:10:09.716 A:middle
that in greater detail.

00:10:13.776 --> 00:10:16.726 A:middle
The route planner tells you when
to leave, how long it will take,

00:10:16.726 --> 00:10:17.946 A:middle
and gives a summary
of the route.

00:10:18.386 --> 00:10:20.636 A:middle
Tapping on this, I get
what we call the list view.

00:10:21.256 --> 00:10:23.266 A:middle
A detailed list of
instructions to follow.

00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:26.736 A:middle
I can expand the list
of stops if I'd like.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:33.106 A:middle
Now, when I select start,
I enter guided navigation

00:10:33.106 --> 00:10:34.416 A:middle
with detailed instructions.

00:10:34.746 --> 00:10:36.056 A:middle
Since I'm already
at the airport,

00:10:36.096 --> 00:10:37.656 A:middle
it just tells me
to board the train.

00:10:38.366 --> 00:10:41.346 A:middle
Tells me to exit at Powell, and
shows me the previous station.

00:10:41.866 --> 00:10:44.896 A:middle
Here you can see we're
recommending a very specific

00:10:44.896 --> 00:10:49.946 A:middle
exit with an exit code, E3,
that's best for Moscone West.

00:10:52.256 --> 00:10:54.616 A:middle
Finally, I arrive
at my destination.

00:10:59.656 --> 00:11:01.086 A:middle
That concludes the presentation.

00:10:59.656 --> 00:11:01.086 A:middle
That concludes the presentation.

00:11:01.666 --> 00:11:04.256 A:middle
