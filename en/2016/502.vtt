00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:19.000 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:22.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:23.556 A:middle
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:26.061 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:26.106 --> 00:00:28.876 A:middle
Welcome, and thank you for
coming to this session.

00:00:29.026 --> 00:00:32.735 A:middle
My name is Ryan Griggs, and I
work on the Apple News team,

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:36.546 A:middle
and I am thrilled to be here
this afternoon to talk to you

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:39.346 A:middle
about some of the great things
you can do in Apple News,

00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:42.326 A:middle
how to get set up, and
some best practices.

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:45.866 A:middle
So we have a lot to cover
today, and so I wanted to go

00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.716 A:middle
through a quick agenda
so we know where we are

00:00:47.716 --> 00:00:49.566 A:middle
in the presentation as
we, as we go through it.

00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:53.336 A:middle
So first we'll do a quick intro
to News to get an understanding

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:55.836 A:middle
of sort of why News exists,
and what it's all about.

00:00:55.836 --> 00:00:58.446 A:middle
We'll also take a quick look
at the app to get some context

00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:01.276 A:middle
as far as where your,
your content

00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:01.276 A:middle
as far as where your,
your content

00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:02.586 A:middle
and your publication
will show up.

00:01:03.416 --> 00:01:05.796 A:middle
And then next we'll
learn how to set

00:01:05.796 --> 00:01:09.816 A:middle
up your channel using News
Publisher, which is the tool

00:01:09.816 --> 00:01:11.976 A:middle
that we use to manage
content in Apple News.

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:16.136 A:middle
Then we'll do a quick
overview of RSS,

00:01:16.136 --> 00:01:20.896 A:middle
and then we'll dive a bit
deeper on Apple News Format.

00:01:21.976 --> 00:01:23.826 A:middle
Then we'll also talk about how

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:26.016 A:middle
to publish articles
in Apple News.

00:01:26.016 --> 00:01:28.096 A:middle
We have a few different
options and make it really easy

00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:30.896 A:middle
to author and then deliver
content into our system.

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:33.736 A:middle
We'll talk about how to
make money off your content.

00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:36.306 A:middle
Talk about analytics
and insights.

00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:37.706 A:middle
Specifically, what's
available to you

00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:41.306 A:middle
as an Apple News Format
Publisher, and then talk

00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:42.536 A:middle
about a few best practices

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:45.976 A:middle
for making your publication
successful in Apple News.

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:51.186 A:middle
So, first, let's do a quick
intro to the Apple News app.

00:01:51.856 --> 00:01:56.126 A:middle
So News was launched with
iOS9 last year with the goal

00:01:56.126 --> 00:01:58.976 A:middle
of delivering the best stories
from the best publishers,

00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:00.846 A:middle
and then personalizing
it for you.

00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:00.846 A:middle
and then personalizing
it for you.

00:02:02.426 --> 00:02:06.596 A:middle
And so News is built right into
iOS, which means it's available

00:02:06.596 --> 00:02:12.116 A:middle
to anyone with an iOS device
as long as they live in one

00:02:12.116 --> 00:02:15.056 A:middle
of the three countries News is
available in, and so News is

00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:18.536 A:middle
in the U.S., U.K. and
Australia right now.

00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:23.856 A:middle
And so one of the big parts
of News is Apple News Format,

00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:26.316 A:middle
which is our JSON
based document format.

00:02:26.576 --> 00:02:30.086 A:middle
It makes it possible to create
some amazing very engaging

00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:32.426 A:middle
experiences within
your articles.

00:02:32.426 --> 00:02:34.596 A:middle
And so we'll talk a bit
more about that later.

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:37.876 A:middle
But in order to understand
how cool Apple News Format is,

00:02:37.876 --> 00:02:40.986 A:middle
I wanted to show you a few
articles that are good examples

00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:41.866 A:middle
of what you can do with it.

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:44.556 A:middle
So this one is an
article from "Wired,"

00:02:44.556 --> 00:02:47.316 A:middle
and we'll actually
scroll through this

00:02:47.316 --> 00:02:49.246 A:middle
and take a look at
what's in there.

00:02:49.246 --> 00:02:51.436 A:middle
You can see there's a little
bit of parallax as we scroll.

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:52.556 A:middle
There's beautiful imagery.

00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:54.216 A:middle
This is a photo mosaic.

00:02:54.526 --> 00:02:56.916 A:middle
Can tap in on the photos,
swipe through them.

00:02:57.526 --> 00:02:59.926 A:middle
It's really great,
immersive, and beautiful.

00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:02.866 A:middle
And you'll also notice, too,
that as we scroll, this is,

00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:02.866 A:middle
And you'll also notice, too,
that as we scroll, this is,

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:04.286 A:middle
of course, a, a "Wired" article.

00:03:04.646 --> 00:03:05.886 A:middle
This looks like "Wired".

00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:08.496 A:middle
And so we give you the
tools to make your articles

00:03:08.496 --> 00:03:10.456 A:middle
and your channel
look like your brand.

00:03:11.876 --> 00:03:13.916 A:middle
So here's another
one from "Bloomberg."

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:17.666 A:middle
Very different look to this,
but, again, very striking

00:03:17.756 --> 00:03:18.956 A:middle
with some beautiful photography.

00:03:18.956 --> 00:03:21.736 A:middle
You see we have some of
type on top of the images.

00:03:22.096 --> 00:03:25.156 A:middle
As you scroll, some really
beautiful bold topography.

00:03:25.276 --> 00:03:26.816 A:middle
Great use of parallax here.

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:31.376 A:middle
It really shows a lot of emotion
and depth in this article.

00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:33.336 A:middle
So another great example.

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:34.276 A:middle
Show you one more.

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:35.116 A:middle
This one in iPad.

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:37.966 A:middle
You can really do a lot of
cool stuff with Apple News,

00:03:37.966 --> 00:03:40.166 A:middle
and this is an example of
a publisher of the BBC who,

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:43.216 A:middle
who really created something
at the beginning of the article

00:03:43.216 --> 00:03:44.876 A:middle
that makes you want
to read further

00:03:44.876 --> 00:03:47.426 A:middle
and see what other great
stuff you might find.

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:51.176 A:middle
So Apple News Format gives you
a lot of really cool tools.

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:53.686 A:middle
So let's take a quick
look at the News app.

00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:56.466 A:middle
Just understand where
your content shows up.

00:03:56.946 --> 00:03:59.936 A:middle
So News is organized
into five separate tabs.

00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:02.206 A:middle
So first we have For You.

00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:06.176 A:middle
For You is a personalized feed
of articles that deliver content

00:04:06.176 --> 00:04:08.156 A:middle
that you're interested in based
upon what you're following

00:04:08.156 --> 00:04:08.816 A:middle
and what you're reading.

00:04:09.536 --> 00:04:11.726 A:middle
And it's got a huge update,
as you saw yesterday.

00:04:12.246 --> 00:04:15.736 A:middle
We have a completely new
redesign and all new look

00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:19.766 A:middle
and feel but also the concept of
sections, which include things

00:04:19.766 --> 00:04:22.996 A:middle
like trending, topic groups
based upon what you're following

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:26.736 A:middle
in News, and then featured
stories which allow our editors

00:04:26.736 --> 00:04:28.176 A:middle
to find some of the
most beautiful,

00:04:28.376 --> 00:04:30.286 A:middle
engaging Apple News
format articles

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:32.176 A:middle
and feature them
right in for you.

00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:34.516 A:middle
Favorites.

00:04:34.516 --> 00:04:35.896 A:middle
This is where your
publication goes

00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:37.866 A:middle
when a user taps the Plus
(+) button to favorite it,

00:04:37.866 --> 00:04:41.306 A:middle
and it allows you just to return
to your publication at any time.

00:04:42.356 --> 00:04:43.546 A:middle
And then we have Explorer.

00:04:44.026 --> 00:04:47.606 A:middle
This is where users will
go to find new channels

00:04:47.876 --> 00:04:51.156 A:middle
and then new topics, and so we
have topics and news in addition

00:04:51.156 --> 00:04:55.386 A:middle
to publications, and these
are essentially combinations

00:04:55.386 --> 00:04:58.126 A:middle
of articles from
different publishers all

00:04:58.126 --> 00:04:59.286 A:middle
around a specific topic.

00:04:59.286 --> 00:05:01.546 A:middle
So you can follow
things like sports

00:04:59.286 --> 00:05:01.546 A:middle
So you can follow
things like sports

00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:03.516 A:middle
or heavy metal or
whatever you like.

00:05:04.756 --> 00:05:06.576 A:middle
Then, of course, we have Search.

00:05:06.686 --> 00:05:08.706 A:middle
We have hundreds of
thousands of topics in News,

00:05:08.706 --> 00:05:10.216 A:middle
and you can search for topics

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:12.476 A:middle
and publications
in the News app.

00:05:12.476 --> 00:05:15.196 A:middle
And then, finally, your
articles can end up in Saved.

00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:18.016 A:middle
If a user starts reading
them but feels like they want

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:20.556 A:middle
to finish reading it
later, and you can also look

00:05:20.556 --> 00:05:22.746 A:middle
at your history and clear
it if you like as well.

00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:26.376 A:middle
So that's how News is
organized within the app.

00:05:27.416 --> 00:05:29.196 A:middle
So during this session, we're
going to talk about some

00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:31.556 A:middle
of the best practices when
publishing news and how

00:05:31.556 --> 00:05:34.816 A:middle
to get set up, but, first,
let's discuss your publication

00:05:35.186 --> 00:05:36.806 A:middle
and how it shows up in News.

00:05:37.146 --> 00:05:39.906 A:middle
So publications in News
are called channels.

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:41.326 A:middle
So what is a channel?

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:43.966 A:middle
Well, this is what a
channel looks like,

00:05:43.966 --> 00:05:45.676 A:middle
and this is the one
we're going to create

00:05:45.676 --> 00:05:48.126 A:middle
in News today in
this presentation.

00:05:48.576 --> 00:05:51.256 A:middle
So channels represent your
publication in News are sort

00:05:51.256 --> 00:05:52.896 A:middle
of like your home page.

00:05:53.356 --> 00:05:56.036 A:middle
Articles you publish
appear in your channel,

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:59.556 A:middle
and it's where users can
return to to engage more deeply

00:05:59.556 --> 00:06:01.806 A:middle
and directly specifically
with your brand.

00:05:59.556 --> 00:06:01.806 A:middle
and directly specifically
with your brand.

00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:06.046 A:middle
So a good example for, of
a channel would be, like,

00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:09.486 A:middle
a magazines, a newspaper,
or a blog.

00:06:10.606 --> 00:06:11.876 A:middle
They're very customizable.

00:06:11.876 --> 00:06:14.306 A:middle
So you can really make them
reflect the look of your brand.

00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:17.706 A:middle
So you can do things
like customize the logo,

00:06:17.706 --> 00:06:19.856 A:middle
add a cover image, which
we'll talk about a bit later

00:06:19.856 --> 00:06:22.256 A:middle
and customize sections
to organize your content.

00:06:22.806 --> 00:06:24.996 A:middle
And you can create
more than one channel.

00:06:24.996 --> 00:06:28.406 A:middle
So if you have more than one
blog or more than one newspaper,

00:06:28.536 --> 00:06:30.286 A:middle
you can have a separate
channel for each one.

00:06:31.846 --> 00:06:35.396 A:middle
They can be based on Apple News
format or RSS, and you can link

00:06:35.396 --> 00:06:37.546 A:middle
to them just using
a regular link.

00:06:39.936 --> 00:06:42.256 A:middle
So how do we set up a
channel in News Publisher,

00:06:42.966 --> 00:06:44.826 A:middle
or to set up a channel
in Apple News?

00:06:44.826 --> 00:06:49.216 A:middle
You go to our web, online web
tool called News Publisher.

00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:52.996 A:middle
And so News Publisher
makes it really easy

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:54.666 A:middle
to manage your presence
in Apple News.

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.706 A:middle
It lets you do things like
set up and configure options

00:06:57.706 --> 00:06:59.606 A:middle
for your channels to
make sure it looks like

00:06:59.606 --> 00:07:00.776 A:middle
and works like you want it to.

00:06:59.606 --> 00:07:00.776 A:middle
and works like you want it to.

00:07:00.856 --> 00:07:03.786 A:middle
It lets you assign roles to
people in your organization.

00:07:04.546 --> 00:07:08.276 A:middle
It lets you view analytics, set
up reports, and gain insight

00:07:08.346 --> 00:07:10.576 A:middle
on how your articles and
your channel is performing.

00:07:11.646 --> 00:07:14.156 A:middle
It also helps you set
up delivery of content

00:07:14.156 --> 00:07:15.096 A:middle
and helps you manage it.

00:07:16.566 --> 00:07:20.036 A:middle
It even lets you create Apple
News format articles right

00:07:20.036 --> 00:07:22.266 A:middle
from News Publisher, and we'll
do a demo of that shortly.

00:07:23.626 --> 00:07:25.176 A:middle
So a few things to think

00:07:25.176 --> 00:07:27.006 A:middle
about before you sign
up for Apple News.

00:07:27.286 --> 00:07:28.676 A:middle
You want to consider who will,

00:07:28.676 --> 00:07:29.946 A:middle
who's going to manage
the account.

00:07:30.336 --> 00:07:32.746 A:middle
Think about people like interns.

00:07:32.746 --> 00:07:35.116 A:middle
They eventually leave, and
you don't want to leave access

00:07:35.116 --> 00:07:37.016 A:middle
to your account to an intern

00:07:37.016 --> 00:07:38.216 A:middle
that won't be here
in a few months.

00:07:38.216 --> 00:07:40.726 A:middle
So make sure you give
access to someone

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:42.056 A:middle
who will be with
you for a while.

00:07:42.326 --> 00:07:43.826 A:middle
So a common problem
that we have.

00:07:44.606 --> 00:07:47.576 A:middle
You also want to use a real
e-mail address that you own.

00:07:47.576 --> 00:07:50.556 A:middle
Sounds like an obvious thing,
but we actually communicate

00:07:50.556 --> 00:07:53.236 A:middle
with you via this e-mail
address if we find issues with,

00:07:53.536 --> 00:07:55.996 A:middle
for example, your RSS
feed or what we're finding

00:07:55.996 --> 00:07:57.376 A:middle
in your Apple News
format articles.

00:07:57.806 --> 00:07:59.606 A:middle
And so we want to be able to
use that to get a hold of you.

00:08:00.096 --> 00:08:02.706 A:middle
And also think about
international distribution.

00:08:03.476 --> 00:08:05.706 A:middle
So News is available in the
U.S., U.K., and Australia.

00:08:05.706 --> 00:08:07.816 A:middle
You want to make sure
that you've got rights

00:08:07.816 --> 00:08:10.076 A:middle
to deliver whatever
content, images,

00:08:10.076 --> 00:08:13.186 A:middle
etc. in Apple News
in these territories.

00:08:13.186 --> 00:08:17.016 A:middle
And so the easiest way to sign
up to publish in Apple News is

00:08:17.016 --> 00:08:20.396 A:middle
to go to our developer page or
just go to Apple.com/news scroll

00:08:20.396 --> 00:08:22.926 A:middle
to the bottom, and then
click on Sign-Up Now.

00:08:22.996 --> 00:08:25.556 A:middle
That will take you
directly to News Publisher.

00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:28.046 A:middle
So News Publisher
requires an Apple ID.

00:08:28.046 --> 00:08:30.306 A:middle
If you don't have one already,
then you'll be prompted

00:08:30.306 --> 00:08:32.775 A:middle
to set one up, although I
suspect most people here

00:08:32.775 --> 00:08:33.216 A:middle
have one.

00:08:33.716 --> 00:08:36.025 A:middle
And then once you've signed
up to publish in Apple News,

00:08:36.356 --> 00:08:39.525 A:middle
the News Publisher icon
will show up in iCloud next

00:08:39.525 --> 00:08:41.856 A:middle
to your other icons so you can
get back to it really quickly.

00:08:42.525 --> 00:08:44.706 A:middle
It's one of the great things
about using Apple ID is

00:08:45.156 --> 00:08:46.596 A:middle
that when you use the same one

00:08:46.596 --> 00:08:47.986 A:middle
as on your iOS device
it allows you

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:49.986 A:middle
to easily preview articles
before you publish right

00:08:49.986 --> 00:08:50.656 A:middle
on your device.

00:08:53.696 --> 00:08:55.486 A:middle
So this is what News
Publisher looks like.

00:08:55.546 --> 00:08:58.636 A:middle
We're not going to dive into
it just yet, but we're going

00:08:58.636 --> 00:09:00.896 A:middle
to start up by talking about
a few of the things you need

00:08:58.636 --> 00:09:00.896 A:middle
to start up by talking about
a few of the things you need

00:09:01.036 --> 00:09:02.856 A:middle
when you're setting
up your channel.

00:09:03.846 --> 00:09:06.276 A:middle
So every channel, no
matter if it's using RSS

00:09:07.096 --> 00:09:09.116 A:middle
or Apple News format,
needs a few things.

00:09:09.336 --> 00:09:12.406 A:middle
One, it needs sections; two,
it needs a channel logo;

00:09:12.646 --> 00:09:14.306 A:middle
and it needs a cover image.

00:09:14.986 --> 00:09:18.086 A:middle
And so let's talk about the best
practices for a few of these.

00:09:18.976 --> 00:09:20.066 A:middle
So, first, sections.

00:09:20.496 --> 00:09:23.836 A:middle
So sections make it possible
to group your articles by type.

00:09:23.836 --> 00:09:27.416 A:middle
So, like, entertainment,
top stories, or sports.

00:09:28.246 --> 00:09:30.516 A:middle
You can have a lot
of sections in News,

00:09:30.516 --> 00:09:33.286 A:middle
but we really recommend
only having three to four

00:09:33.546 --> 00:09:36.866 A:middle
because essentially we
don't see people scrolling

00:09:36.866 --> 00:09:39.706 A:middle
to find more channels that are
off screen, and you want them

00:09:39.706 --> 00:09:42.646 A:middle
to fit on an iPhone
screen at rest.

00:09:44.046 --> 00:09:47.146 A:middle
And for the same reason as
using only as many sections

00:09:47.146 --> 00:09:49.686 A:middle
as you need, keep
the name short.

00:09:49.866 --> 00:09:51.166 A:middle
You don't want to
have really long names

00:09:51.166 --> 00:09:52.706 A:middle
that push your other
sections off the screen.

00:09:52.836 --> 00:09:56.026 A:middle
It's important to note that
the first section is always

00:09:56.116 --> 00:09:56.646 A:middle
the default.

00:09:56.646 --> 00:09:59.306 A:middle
So when users come to your
channel or return to it,

00:09:59.306 --> 00:10:00.976 A:middle
this is what they
will see first.

00:09:59.306 --> 00:10:00.976 A:middle
this is what they
will see first.

00:10:01.076 --> 00:10:02.576 A:middle
It's sort of like
the first impression

00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:04.456 A:middle
that they'll, that
they will see.

00:10:05.646 --> 00:10:08.486 A:middle
Another really important
note is when Apple News goes

00:10:08.486 --> 00:10:12.216 A:middle
and builds the For You feed,
it's going to look at articles

00:10:12.216 --> 00:10:16.006 A:middle
that are in your default first
section in your channel and pull

00:10:16.006 --> 00:10:17.836 A:middle
from there and not
your other sections.

00:10:18.516 --> 00:10:21.786 A:middle
So if you want to have your
articles potentially show up in

00:10:21.786 --> 00:10:25.606 A:middle
For You, for, in user's Apple
News app, you need to make sure

00:10:25.606 --> 00:10:28.296 A:middle
that you're publishing them
to the default section.

00:10:30.056 --> 00:10:32.306 A:middle
So for the channel logo,

00:10:32.646 --> 00:10:35.206 A:middle
the channel logo is
essentially an image

00:10:35.546 --> 00:10:37.206 A:middle
of your publication's logo.

00:10:37.796 --> 00:10:39.806 A:middle
And so for maximum
legibility, you want your logo

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:42.906 A:middle
to be horizontal
text on one line,

00:10:42.906 --> 00:10:44.866 A:middle
use transparent background
with no fill.

00:10:44.916 --> 00:10:46.926 A:middle
If you don't use a transparent
background, you're going to end

00:10:46.926 --> 00:10:49.026 A:middle
up with a logo that looks
something like this.

00:10:49.026 --> 00:10:51.966 A:middle
Something that we see fairly
often, and we, we need to,

00:10:52.586 --> 00:10:53.856 A:middle
to reach out to publishers
to fix.

00:10:54.376 --> 00:10:56.806 A:middle
Also avoid using
just raw photos.

00:10:56.806 --> 00:10:58.466 A:middle
They're going to end
up being really small

00:10:58.466 --> 00:11:00.436 A:middle
in the various places
that we use them in News,

00:10:58.466 --> 00:11:00.436 A:middle
in the various places
that we use them in News,

00:11:00.686 --> 00:11:03.526 A:middle
and sometimes we end up just
being a, a grey box as well

00:11:03.526 --> 00:11:04.836 A:middle
because they don't
have transparency.

00:11:05.696 --> 00:11:10.326 A:middle
We recommend having a logo
that's 256 pixels tall,

00:11:10.326 --> 00:11:13.066 A:middle
and then not more than
10 to 1 aspect ratio,

00:11:13.066 --> 00:11:14.796 A:middle
but don't make it any
wider than you need to.

00:11:15.226 --> 00:11:17.656 A:middle
Otherwise, it will make
it incredibly small

00:11:17.656 --> 00:11:19.116 A:middle
in some places like 4U Feeds.

00:11:19.116 --> 00:11:22.466 A:middle
If you can, avoid
things like copyrights

00:11:22.466 --> 00:11:24.916 A:middle
and trademarks alongside
your logo.

00:11:24.916 --> 00:11:27.416 A:middle
In many places, the logos
are very small on the screen,

00:11:27.756 --> 00:11:29.686 A:middle
and they just get lost
in the [inaudible].

00:11:30.626 --> 00:11:33.516 A:middle
And then, finally, with
promotional text or URL's,

00:11:33.516 --> 00:11:36.036 A:middle
you typically want to avoid
using those if you can.

00:11:36.186 --> 00:11:38.546 A:middle
The promotional text will be
very hard to read in places,

00:11:38.546 --> 00:11:39.936 A:middle
and just makes your
logo smaller.

00:11:39.936 --> 00:11:42.546 A:middle
And then URL's set
up the expectation

00:11:42.546 --> 00:11:45.846 A:middle
that they will be tappable,
which, of course, they won't be.

00:11:47.616 --> 00:11:52.426 A:middle
And so this is what a channel
logo looks like in the 4U Feed.

00:11:52.606 --> 00:11:54.826 A:middle
And so this is a
really important place

00:11:54.826 --> 00:11:58.436 A:middle
for your channel logo to look
great because the vast majority

00:11:58.436 --> 00:12:01.856 A:middle
of our users spend time in 4U,
and so you want to make sure

00:11:58.436 --> 00:12:01.856 A:middle
of our users spend time in 4U,
and so you want to make sure

00:12:01.856 --> 00:12:04.236 A:middle
that your logo looks great
and is highly legible here.

00:12:05.276 --> 00:12:08.416 A:middle
So your logo also appears
in your channel tile,

00:12:08.866 --> 00:12:11.036 A:middle
and so the channel tile is a
combination of the channel logo

00:12:11.036 --> 00:12:12.766 A:middle
and what we call a cover image.

00:12:13.936 --> 00:12:16.346 A:middle
And a channel tile is
essentially your billboard

00:12:16.626 --> 00:12:19.896 A:middle
within News to bring readers
in, and this is what it looks

00:12:19.896 --> 00:12:24.826 A:middle
like in favorites, but it's also
featured in several other places

00:12:24.826 --> 00:12:27.506 A:middle
in News, including our
on-boarding experience.

00:12:27.506 --> 00:12:30.806 A:middle
This is where users first
enter News and make decisions

00:12:30.806 --> 00:12:33.296 A:middle
about who they're going to
follow in the Apple News app.

00:12:33.296 --> 00:12:35.656 A:middle
And so this is going to be
your only representation,

00:12:35.656 --> 00:12:38.266 A:middle
especially for those users
who don't know anything

00:12:38.266 --> 00:12:39.206 A:middle
about your publication.

00:12:39.206 --> 00:12:41.376 A:middle
You want to make sure
that you have a great logo

00:12:41.376 --> 00:12:43.386 A:middle
and a great cover image
that's representative

00:12:43.606 --> 00:12:46.626 A:middle
of what your brand is all
about and is super engaging.

00:12:47.306 --> 00:12:50.886 A:middle
We also have channel
tiles in Explorer

00:12:51.216 --> 00:12:54.956 A:middle
where editors can feature them,
and we have recommendations come

00:12:54.956 --> 00:12:57.106 A:middle
in the For You feed
occasionally.

00:12:57.296 --> 00:13:01.366 A:middle
So it's a really important way
to drive users to sign up for,

00:12:57.296 --> 00:13:01.366 A:middle
So it's a really important way
to drive users to sign up for,

00:13:01.486 --> 00:13:03.806 A:middle
to follow your channel
and to read it.

00:13:04.956 --> 00:13:08.266 A:middle
So to make the cover image look
as great as possible, please,

00:13:08.266 --> 00:13:11.866 A:middle
please submit a high-quality,
high-resolution images.

00:13:11.866 --> 00:13:14.266 A:middle
We recommend 600 x 600 pixels.

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:17.076 A:middle
You can choose two
paths for this.

00:13:17.076 --> 00:13:19.006 A:middle
You can either do
a static cover,

00:13:19.376 --> 00:13:21.136 A:middle
which means that it
will always be the same.

00:13:21.436 --> 00:13:22.816 A:middle
This is great for brands

00:13:22.816 --> 00:13:26.356 A:middle
that have a really
identifiable logo mark, or an,

00:13:26.356 --> 00:13:29.096 A:middle
an image that users will
recognize when they see it,

00:13:29.786 --> 00:13:32.856 A:middle
but you can also choose to have
a dynamic cover image as well.

00:13:33.246 --> 00:13:35.826 A:middle
This is great if you want users
returning to your channel,

00:13:35.826 --> 00:13:38.916 A:middle
and they see your tile,
and it actually pulls image

00:13:38.916 --> 00:13:42.146 A:middle
from articles in your feed,
and so it stays very up to date

00:13:42.146 --> 00:13:43.866 A:middle
and dynamic with what's
happening in your channel.

00:13:45.316 --> 00:13:48.116 A:middle
So when you're signing up
to publish in Apple News,

00:13:48.336 --> 00:13:49.826 A:middle
you'll eventually
see this screen

00:13:50.216 --> 00:13:52.826 A:middle
where you can choose whether to
sign up for Apple News format

00:13:52.826 --> 00:13:54.246 A:middle
or whether to use RSS.

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.586 A:middle
So we're going to talk
about each of these.

00:13:57.786 --> 00:14:00.236 A:middle
Let's briefly talk about RSS.

00:13:57.786 --> 00:14:00.236 A:middle
Let's briefly talk about RSS.

00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:03.116 A:middle
So when does it make
sense to use RSS?

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:07.046 A:middle
So News supports displaying
articles from your RSS feed

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:10.026 A:middle
if you have one, and it's
an appropriate solution

00:14:10.026 --> 00:14:13.386 A:middle
if you already have a website
or you already have an RSS feed,

00:14:13.516 --> 00:14:15.956 A:middle
and you want to get your content
into News really quickly.

00:14:16.776 --> 00:14:20.066 A:middle
But, ultimately, we only
really recommend using RSS

00:14:20.066 --> 00:14:23.056 A:middle
as a stepping stone to
get to Apple News format.

00:14:23.466 --> 00:14:26.576 A:middle
It's important to note that the
vast majority of articles read

00:14:26.576 --> 00:14:29.136 A:middle
in Apple News are using
Apple News format,

00:14:29.366 --> 00:14:30.806 A:middle
and so they're really engaging.

00:14:31.076 --> 00:14:33.996 A:middle
They have animations and
parallax and all of the things

00:14:33.996 --> 00:14:35.296 A:middle
that Apple News format allows.

00:14:35.656 --> 00:14:38.516 A:middle
And so if you're not using
Apple News format, it's a,

00:14:38.516 --> 00:14:41.066 A:middle
it's not a great comparison.

00:14:41.066 --> 00:14:43.596 A:middle
So we, it's always best
to use Apple News format.

00:14:43.596 --> 00:14:46.006 A:middle
But if you do need to use Apple
News format, or if you do need

00:14:46.006 --> 00:14:47.466 A:middle
to use RSS, these are some

00:14:47.626 --> 00:14:50.386 A:middle
of the features that,
that RSS supports.

00:14:50.386 --> 00:14:52.356 A:middle
Gives you the ability
to, to pull in images,

00:14:52.356 --> 00:14:53.526 A:middle
headlines, and excerpts.

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:57.366 A:middle
We also show a preview
page of RSS articles

00:14:57.366 --> 00:14:58.606 A:middle
that it pulls from your feed.

00:14:59.016 --> 00:15:02.816 A:middle
And so this allows
those to, those previews

00:14:59.016 --> 00:15:02.816 A:middle
And so this allows
those to, those previews

00:15:02.816 --> 00:15:04.796 A:middle
to load really quickly
so we don't have

00:15:04.796 --> 00:15:06.146 A:middle
to load from your web page.

00:15:06.866 --> 00:15:08.506 A:middle
We host the RSS excerpt.

00:15:08.506 --> 00:15:11.566 A:middle
So when you use a [inaudible]
article, it loads immediately.

00:15:11.566 --> 00:15:13.596 A:middle
And then, of course,

00:15:13.596 --> 00:15:16.626 A:middle
you ultimately will host your
web page if users choose to tap

00:15:16.626 --> 00:15:18.526 A:middle
through to your web page.

00:15:19.986 --> 00:15:22.306 A:middle
So there's some best
practices for RSS.

00:15:22.306 --> 00:15:25.376 A:middle
You want to make your
preview full and enticing.

00:15:25.826 --> 00:15:29.186 A:middle
If you make it really short,
the odds are users will tap in,

00:15:29.186 --> 00:15:31.786 A:middle
see that it's only a sentence
or two, and then go back out

00:15:31.786 --> 00:15:34.066 A:middle
and look for one of the many
Apple News format articles

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:36.046 A:middle
that offer a full experience.

00:15:37.696 --> 00:15:41.486 A:middle
So use long form, full
text RSS when you can,

00:15:42.186 --> 00:15:44.516 A:middle
and avoid links to
unrelated content.

00:15:44.816 --> 00:15:47.086 A:middle
Things like boilerplates,
article footers,

00:15:47.086 --> 00:15:49.836 A:middle
terms and conditions, user
agreements, privacy policies.

00:15:49.836 --> 00:15:52.226 A:middle
You don't really need
that in your preview,

00:15:52.366 --> 00:15:55.066 A:middle
and it just clutters up the
experience and takes away

00:15:55.066 --> 00:15:57.666 A:middle
from the simplicity and
the beauty of your article.

00:15:58.446 --> 00:16:01.526 A:middle
And then Apple News
already has built

00:15:58.446 --> 00:16:01.526 A:middle
And then Apple News
already has built

00:16:01.526 --> 00:16:05.066 A:middle
into some great sharing features
that users are accustomed

00:16:05.066 --> 00:16:07.366 A:middle
to using to share your
content is you don't need

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:10.906 A:middle
to include links like tweet
this or like this on Facebook.

00:16:11.256 --> 00:16:13.126 A:middle
The app already takes
care of that, and, again,

00:16:13.126 --> 00:16:14.656 A:middle
it just adds noise
to your article.

00:16:15.496 --> 00:16:20.506 A:middle
Make sure your actual web page
is optimized for Safari on iOS.

00:16:20.656 --> 00:16:22.866 A:middle
The worst thing you can
have is a user follows

00:16:22.866 --> 00:16:24.386 A:middle
through the preview,
goes to your web page,

00:16:24.386 --> 00:16:26.926 A:middle
and then they have a big
desktop formatted website.

00:16:28.416 --> 00:16:30.246 A:middle
Then, finally, similar to
a point I made earlier,

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:32.286 A:middle
make sure you provide a
dedicated point of contact.

00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:34.336 A:middle
So something happens
with your RSS feed,

00:16:34.336 --> 00:16:36.986 A:middle
and we're having trouble getting
your content to appear in News,

00:16:36.986 --> 00:16:38.506 A:middle
we want to be able
to reach out to you.

00:16:40.056 --> 00:16:42.846 A:middle
So when you first set up your
channel, your RSS channel,

00:16:42.846 --> 00:16:47.176 A:middle
you can configure your feeds,
and you do that by setting

00:16:47.176 --> 00:16:49.026 A:middle
up your sections that
we talked about earlier.

00:16:49.026 --> 00:16:50.646 A:middle
So you start out with
your default section.

00:16:50.646 --> 00:16:52.746 A:middle
This is the one that
For You pulls from,

00:16:53.216 --> 00:16:55.246 A:middle
and you can customize
that default section.

00:16:55.246 --> 00:16:57.806 A:middle
You can change the name, and
then there's a field to set

00:16:57.806 --> 00:17:01.036 A:middle
up your RSS feed, you can have
multiple RSS feeds for sections,

00:16:57.806 --> 00:17:01.036 A:middle
up your RSS feed, you can have
multiple RSS feeds for sections,

00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:02.406 A:middle
per section if you like.

00:17:02.406 --> 00:17:05.016 A:middle
And so this is what it looks
like once you have it populated.

00:17:05.126 --> 00:17:08.715 A:middle
You can reorder them, and change
them later if you like as well.

00:17:10.856 --> 00:17:13.086 A:middle
And so once you're up and
running and approved to go

00:17:13.086 --> 00:17:17.935 A:middle
in Apple News, this is what your
News Publisher interface will

00:17:17.935 --> 00:17:18.465 A:middle
look like.

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:20.915 A:middle
You'll see we have a couple
tabs there where you can return

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:24.386 A:middle
and manage your sections,
manage your channel info, etc.

00:17:26.576 --> 00:17:30.196 A:middle
But, ultimately, you want to
up, upgrade to Apple News format

00:17:30.196 --> 00:17:32.526 A:middle
as soon as you can, and so
we have a big blue button

00:17:32.526 --> 00:17:34.096 A:middle
at the top that makes
that really easy.

00:17:34.516 --> 00:17:37.286 A:middle
Once you click that, you can
just click OK in the dialogue,

00:17:37.286 --> 00:17:39.166 A:middle
and that'll move you on
to Apple News format.

00:17:40.216 --> 00:17:42.086 A:middle
So what can you do
with Apple News format?

00:17:42.086 --> 00:17:42.926 A:middle
Why is it so great?

00:17:43.126 --> 00:17:48.406 A:middle
Well, first, we provide a, a
robust content delivery network.

00:17:48.406 --> 00:17:50.306 A:middle
We have points of
presence around the world

00:17:50.306 --> 00:17:52.926 A:middle
that ensures lightning
fast loading and no delay.

00:17:52.926 --> 00:17:54.806 A:middle
Nothing will ensure people
won't read your article

00:17:54.806 --> 00:17:56.426 A:middle
like an article that
doesn't load.

00:17:58.056 --> 00:17:59.846 A:middle
We also supply rich analytics,

00:18:00.836 --> 00:18:03.786 A:middle
and we also automatically
optimize for each device.

00:18:03.786 --> 00:18:06.906 A:middle
Apple News format is really
focused on author wants

00:18:06.906 --> 00:18:10.296 A:middle
and having it look great on
any device automatically.

00:18:11.206 --> 00:18:14.576 A:middle
We provide simple but
powerful monetization tools.

00:18:15.556 --> 00:18:19.166 A:middle
We have a dedicated Apple News
editorial team that's just

00:18:19.166 --> 00:18:21.116 A:middle
looking for great
content every single day,

00:18:21.116 --> 00:18:23.066 A:middle
and that's a huge
opportunity for you

00:18:23.066 --> 00:18:26.326 A:middle
if you're creating really
engaging cool stuff.

00:18:26.546 --> 00:18:28.016 A:middle
We also have built-in
cross promotion.

00:18:28.016 --> 00:18:31.296 A:middle
So if publish an article
using Apple News format,

00:18:31.716 --> 00:18:35.956 A:middle
it's really easy to have at
the bottom of it, more articles

00:18:35.956 --> 00:18:38.846 A:middle
from your channel and related
articles from other channels.

00:18:39.216 --> 00:18:40.816 A:middle
It's a great way to
drive additional traffic.

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:44.826 A:middle
Apple News format itself
supports lots of cool features

00:18:45.146 --> 00:18:47.956 A:middle
like animations,
parallax, galleries,

00:18:47.956 --> 00:18:50.796 A:middle
videos, photo mosaics.

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:52.666 A:middle
It's incredibly powerful
and really easy

00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:54.496 A:middle
to add these elements
to your articles.

00:18:55.226 --> 00:18:58.026 A:middle
We also support dynamic
text sizing.

00:18:58.026 --> 00:19:02.806 A:middle
If you have that set in iOS
for improved legibility,

00:18:58.026 --> 00:19:02.806 A:middle
If you have that set in iOS
for improved legibility,

00:19:03.346 --> 00:19:05.506 A:middle
and then we're also
very accessible.

00:19:05.506 --> 00:19:07.366 A:middle
We have great support for
the accessibility features

00:19:07.366 --> 00:19:08.626 A:middle
in iOS like voice over.

00:19:08.996 --> 00:19:11.146 A:middle
And we have lots of
options for delivery

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:13.476 A:middle
of content into Apple News.

00:19:13.546 --> 00:19:17.306 A:middle
So lots of advantages to
using Apple News format.

00:19:18.376 --> 00:19:21.556 A:middle
And so we clicked our
blue button in RSS,

00:19:21.896 --> 00:19:25.436 A:middle
and we've been approved
to use Apple News format.

00:19:25.436 --> 00:19:27.236 A:middle
And so we've got our channel
ready, but now we need

00:19:27.236 --> 00:19:31.316 A:middle
to deliver an article into Apple
News so we can take a look at it

00:19:31.316 --> 00:19:33.616 A:middle
and make sure that it's
formatted correctly and,

00:19:33.616 --> 00:19:34.636 A:middle
and is working as it should,

00:19:34.636 --> 00:19:36.286 A:middle
and so you can do
that a couple ways.

00:19:37.316 --> 00:19:39.976 A:middle
You can do that by creating
an article using the built-in

00:19:39.976 --> 00:19:43.866 A:middle
authoring tool, or you can
deliver an article via the API.

00:19:43.866 --> 00:19:46.316 A:middle
And so we'll talk about both
of those in more detail later,

00:19:47.196 --> 00:19:50.386 A:middle
but let's say that you've
delivered your article.

00:19:50.386 --> 00:19:53.356 A:middle
We'll take a moment to look
at it, and then we'll go

00:19:53.356 --> 00:19:55.086 A:middle
through a pending state.

00:19:55.086 --> 00:19:56.846 A:middle
And then once you're
ready to go,

00:19:57.826 --> 00:20:01.326 A:middle
you'll see at the top
available in News status,

00:19:57.826 --> 00:20:01.326 A:middle
you'll see at the top
available in News status,

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:02.976 A:middle
and that means your channel
is live, ready to go.

00:20:03.116 --> 00:20:04.556 A:middle
You're starting, you're ready

00:20:04.556 --> 00:20:06.296 A:middle
to start publishing
articles in Apple News.

00:20:07.996 --> 00:20:09.656 A:middle
And so once you're approved,
you're going to notice

00:20:09.656 --> 00:20:12.526 A:middle
that you're going to have more
tabs there tha were available

00:20:12.806 --> 00:20:15.436 A:middle
to RSS, to your RSS channel.

00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:17.406 A:middle
And so there are
some new ones here,

00:20:17.406 --> 00:20:18.716 A:middle
and some of these
work differently

00:20:18.716 --> 00:20:21.186 A:middle
than the RSS sections.

00:20:21.956 --> 00:20:25.116 A:middle
So one example is the
sections tab itself.

00:20:25.466 --> 00:20:28.096 A:middle
You can see here that there
are no longer RSS feeds

00:20:28.096 --> 00:20:29.626 A:middle
that are associated
with each section.

00:20:29.936 --> 00:20:31.236 A:middle
You don't need your
RSS feed anymore

00:20:31.236 --> 00:20:33.656 A:middle
because Apple News format
handles all of that.

00:20:33.656 --> 00:20:34.796 A:middle
And, of course, you
can reorder them,

00:20:34.796 --> 00:20:36.606 A:middle
rename them here as
you like as well.

00:20:37.616 --> 00:20:40.516 A:middle
We also have the
ability to manage members

00:20:40.516 --> 00:20:42.346 A:middle
and roles within Apple News.

00:20:42.346 --> 00:20:44.846 A:middle
So if you work in a multi-person
team, it's really easy

00:20:44.846 --> 00:20:47.736 A:middle
to invite new users,
assign roles from admin,

00:20:47.736 --> 00:20:50.306 A:middle
which has full access
to everything

00:20:50.356 --> 00:20:53.156 A:middle
in News Publisher all the
way down to sales people

00:20:53.436 --> 00:20:57.566 A:middle
who only access analytics and
view articles or just viewers

00:20:57.566 --> 00:20:58.776 A:middle
who can only view
the content in it.

00:20:59.306 --> 00:21:00.146 A:middle
So very powerful.

00:20:59.306 --> 00:21:00.146 A:middle
So very powerful.

00:21:01.626 --> 00:21:04.236 A:middle
So a few best practices when
you're using Apple News format.

00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:06.516 A:middle
First, you want to make sure
you're using appropriate

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:07.306 A:middle
subject matter.

00:21:07.306 --> 00:21:08.706 A:middle
You want to avoid
things like click bait

00:21:08.706 --> 00:21:09.696 A:middle
or misleading headlines.

00:21:09.696 --> 00:21:11.206 A:middle
It's really not what
we look for in News.

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:13.786 A:middle
News is also not
allowed to be created,

00:21:13.786 --> 00:21:15.346 A:middle
to be used as a marketing
platform.

00:21:15.756 --> 00:21:18.426 A:middle
We really encourage you to
create content that's going

00:21:18.426 --> 00:21:21.366 A:middle
to engage, inform,
and delight users.

00:21:22.486 --> 00:21:25.896 A:middle
And then take advantage of
Apple News format capabilities.

00:21:26.006 --> 00:21:30.486 A:middle
So use things like the animation
and the beautiful galleries

00:21:30.486 --> 00:21:32.786 A:middle
and imagery that
really draws users in

00:21:32.786 --> 00:21:34.556 A:middle
and makes them come back
and makes them read longer.

00:21:34.606 --> 00:21:37.096 A:middle
And use analytics
to your advantage.

00:21:37.096 --> 00:21:38.636 A:middle
Pay attention to what
users are reading,

00:21:38.636 --> 00:21:40.806 A:middle
and maybe they're reading a
lot of one type of article

00:21:40.806 --> 00:21:42.866 A:middle
or a specific article that
you've, that you wrote,

00:21:43.126 --> 00:21:44.866 A:middle
and they may want
to, you may want

00:21:44.866 --> 00:21:45.956 A:middle
to write more articles
like that.

00:21:47.066 --> 00:21:48.386 A:middle
Then, of course, you
want to monetize,

00:21:48.386 --> 00:21:49.316 A:middle
which we'll talk
about in a minute.

00:21:50.126 --> 00:21:54.036 A:middle
So three ways to get your
content into Apple News.

00:21:55.076 --> 00:21:58.496 A:middle
One is web authoring,
another is Apple News API,

00:21:58.496 --> 00:22:00.626 A:middle
and the third is plug-ins.

00:21:58.496 --> 00:22:00.626 A:middle
and the third is plug-ins.

00:22:02.046 --> 00:22:03.506 A:middle
And so, first, let's
talk about web authoring.

00:22:04.826 --> 00:22:07.746 A:middle
So News Publisher supports
a rich drag-and-drop web

00:22:07.746 --> 00:22:08.706 A:middle
authoring experience.

00:22:09.016 --> 00:22:10.896 A:middle
The output's beautiful, simple,

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:12.826 A:middle
Apple News Format
articles directly

00:22:12.826 --> 00:22:13.836 A:middle
to your channel in News.

00:22:14.276 --> 00:22:15.476 A:middle
So rather than showing
more slides,

00:22:15.476 --> 00:22:17.976 A:middle
let me show you a quick demo,
show you how easy it is.

00:22:24.346 --> 00:22:27.556 A:middle
Alright. So this is News
Publisher, and if you want

00:22:27.556 --> 00:22:29.306 A:middle
to make a new Apple
News Format article,

00:22:29.936 --> 00:22:33.926 A:middle
you can just click create
article, and then we land

00:22:33.926 --> 00:22:35.236 A:middle
in the authoring interface.

00:22:36.006 --> 00:22:37.496 A:middle
And so just a quick
tour of this.

00:22:37.496 --> 00:22:39.556 A:middle
We have our standard
toolbar for iCloud up here.

00:22:39.796 --> 00:22:41.316 A:middle
You have undo, redo.

00:22:41.316 --> 00:22:43.446 A:middle
We have a styling palette
that lets you change the look

00:22:43.446 --> 00:22:44.826 A:middle
and feel of each article.

00:22:45.486 --> 00:22:46.566 A:middle
We have a Publish button

00:22:46.566 --> 00:22:48.586 A:middle
that lets you publish
directly to your channel.

00:22:48.586 --> 00:22:51.786 A:middle
We also have a Help Link up
here, which is really useful

00:22:51.786 --> 00:22:54.026 A:middle
and very rich, very deep
if you're having any issues

00:22:54.026 --> 00:22:55.736 A:middle
with publishing in Apple News.

00:22:56.526 --> 00:22:58.026 A:middle
And then we've got
our header image

00:22:58.026 --> 00:22:59.946 A:middle
and the content of
the article below.

00:22:59.946 --> 00:23:02.486 A:middle
So let's start off
by making an article.

00:22:59.946 --> 00:23:02.486 A:middle
So let's start off
by making an article.

00:23:02.536 --> 00:23:03.956 A:middle
So for our header
image, we can choose

00:23:03.956 --> 00:23:06.266 A:middle
to have an image
with a text on top.

00:23:06.756 --> 00:23:08.356 A:middle
You can have the
text below the image,

00:23:08.806 --> 00:23:11.696 A:middle
or we can have a text-only
article with no image.

00:23:12.406 --> 00:23:14.086 A:middle
So let's go and create
an article

00:23:14.086 --> 00:23:15.986 A:middle
that has a beautiful image.

00:23:17.046 --> 00:23:23.456 A:middle
OK. And so let's go, and let's
bring in a nice header image.

00:23:26.866 --> 00:23:29.236 A:middle
Alright. So that looks nice.

00:23:29.236 --> 00:23:35.516 A:middle
Let's add a nice
title and a subtitle.

00:23:36.206 --> 00:23:41.156 A:middle
Let's go to an extra space here,
and then, and have the author,

00:23:41.746 --> 00:23:43.046 A:middle
let's put that in
the right spot, too.

00:23:44.776 --> 00:23:46.186 A:middle
And let's add some body text.

00:23:46.186 --> 00:23:48.376 A:middle
Rather than typing it, just
do a quick copy, paste.

00:23:50.036 --> 00:23:51.326 A:middle
Alright. So now we've
got the beginnings

00:23:51.326 --> 00:23:54.046 A:middle
of a beautiful Apple
News format article.

00:23:54.046 --> 00:23:55.236 A:middle
So you can do a lot of things

00:23:55.236 --> 00:23:57.156 A:middle
to make it really
rich and engaging.

00:23:57.156 --> 00:23:59.146 A:middle
So it's really easy to
add a link, for example,

00:23:59.146 --> 00:24:01.486 A:middle
if we can just, let's
go grab our link here,

00:23:59.146 --> 00:24:01.486 A:middle
if we can just, let's
go grab our link here,

00:24:03.116 --> 00:24:06.686 A:middle
and we can just select the text
we want to turn into a link,

00:24:06.686 --> 00:24:08.506 A:middle
and then we get a
nice pop over here.

00:24:08.676 --> 00:24:11.626 A:middle
We can just click the link
button, paste the URL in,

00:24:11.626 --> 00:24:13.486 A:middle
hit OK, and we've got a link.

00:24:13.486 --> 00:24:16.206 A:middle
And so you can also
add rich text.

00:24:16.206 --> 00:24:18.766 A:middle
For example, if we
just select some text,

00:24:18.766 --> 00:24:20.316 A:middle
we can make it italic.

00:24:20.616 --> 00:24:22.766 A:middle
We can also make it bold.

00:24:22.766 --> 00:24:25.166 A:middle
And so pull quotes are one
of the really cool things

00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:27.176 A:middle
about Apple News, and
so let's make one here.

00:24:27.256 --> 00:24:31.226 A:middle
Let's grab a piece of text,
and let's add it here,

00:24:31.226 --> 00:24:34.076 A:middle
and then if we select
this text, we can make it

00:24:34.076 --> 00:24:35.886 A:middle
into a pull quote
just with one click.

00:24:36.276 --> 00:24:38.426 A:middle
And so that really makes it
stand out and look beautiful.

00:24:38.426 --> 00:24:42.106 A:middle
Now let's do some, some work
on the styling of this article.

00:24:42.106 --> 00:24:44.006 A:middle
So if we click on
the Styling Palette,

00:24:44.006 --> 00:24:46.456 A:middle
we can very quickly jump
between different styles.

00:24:46.456 --> 00:24:47.186 A:middle
Here's modern.

00:24:47.696 --> 00:24:49.656 A:middle
A nice sanserif.

00:24:49.746 --> 00:24:53.876 A:middle
Here's bold, and let's
do classic for this one.

00:24:53.876 --> 00:24:55.756 A:middle
I think classic looks,
looks really nice.

00:24:56.986 --> 00:24:59.386 A:middle
OK, and let's mess around
with the colors a bit.

00:24:59.386 --> 00:25:02.026 A:middle
You can go with a darker
format if you'd like,

00:24:59.386 --> 00:25:02.026 A:middle
You can go with a darker
format if you'd like,

00:25:02.856 --> 00:25:06.006 A:middle
or you can try different
colors, but let's go with a blue

00:25:06.006 --> 00:25:07.106 A:middle
since that looks pretty nice.

00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:10.716 A:middle
It's also really easy to add
images in the body of your text.

00:25:11.076 --> 00:25:12.666 A:middle
So we just grab a
couple of images

00:25:12.666 --> 00:25:15.666 A:middle
from the desktop and drag it in.

00:25:17.416 --> 00:25:23.866 A:middle
The images pop right in, and
you can even add a caption

00:25:24.046 --> 00:25:25.486 A:middle
just by typing right
into the article.

00:25:25.486 --> 00:25:26.876 A:middle
So that looks pretty good.

00:25:27.146 --> 00:25:28.346 A:middle
I think we're ready to publish.

00:25:28.346 --> 00:25:30.616 A:middle
So we can just go up
to the Publish button,

00:25:31.146 --> 00:25:33.176 A:middle
and then remember what
I said about publishing

00:25:33.176 --> 00:25:35.216 A:middle
to your default section if you
wanted to show up in For You.

00:25:35.216 --> 00:25:37.416 A:middle
So let's publish it to Top
Stories, which is our default,

00:25:37.416 --> 00:25:40.206 A:middle
and then let's also
publish to Honeycrisp

00:25:40.206 --> 00:25:42.156 A:middle
because that's what
this article is about.

00:25:42.456 --> 00:25:45.966 A:middle
And we click publish, and
that article will be published

00:25:45.966 --> 00:25:46.716 A:middle
into Apple News.

00:25:51.116 --> 00:25:53.496 A:middle
Alright. So you can see
it's really easy to publish,

00:25:53.496 --> 00:25:56.486 A:middle
and this is what the articles
will look like on your devices.

00:25:56.946 --> 00:26:00.116 A:middle
Beautiful, formatted
perfectly for iPhone

00:25:56.946 --> 00:26:00.116 A:middle
Beautiful, formatted
perfectly for iPhone

00:26:00.396 --> 00:26:01.886 A:middle
and iPad automatically.

00:26:01.886 --> 00:26:04.546 A:middle
You can see at the
bottom we even have a more

00:26:04.906 --> 00:26:07.116 A:middle
from this channel
automatically added

00:26:07.116 --> 00:26:08.116 A:middle
to the end of this article.

00:26:08.766 --> 00:26:11.216 A:middle
So a few things to think

00:26:11.216 --> 00:26:13.546 A:middle
about when you're
authoring using the web tool.

00:26:13.846 --> 00:26:16.106 A:middle
First, choose a striking
cover image.

00:26:16.106 --> 00:26:18.036 A:middle
Great imagery drives
users into your article.

00:26:18.556 --> 00:26:21.406 A:middle
Use a consistent methodology
for fonts and for themes.

00:26:21.406 --> 00:26:22.876 A:middle
You want to have an
identity for your channel

00:26:22.876 --> 00:26:25.746 A:middle
that you follow regularly
without changing it up on users.

00:26:26.036 --> 00:26:27.846 A:middle
Try to include images
throughout the article.

00:26:27.846 --> 00:26:30.406 A:middle
This is really true for any
Apple News format article.

00:26:30.856 --> 00:26:32.696 A:middle
Use imagery and, and multimedia.

00:26:33.586 --> 00:26:35.886 A:middle
Also try to use pull
quotes and embedded links.

00:26:35.886 --> 00:26:37.426 A:middle
You know, use all of the
tools at your disposal

00:26:37.426 --> 00:26:38.086 A:middle
in the authoring tool.

00:26:39.366 --> 00:26:40.476 A:middle
Alright. So that's
the authoring tool.

00:26:40.476 --> 00:26:41.886 A:middle
Let's talk a little
bit about the API.

00:26:41.886 --> 00:26:43.366 A:middle
We're just going to
touch on this briefly.

00:26:43.796 --> 00:26:46.796 A:middle
So Apple News offers
a RESTful HTTP API.

00:26:46.976 --> 00:26:49.346 A:middle
This is great for medium
to large publishers

00:26:49.346 --> 00:26:50.776 A:middle
with existing CMS'
that they want

00:26:50.776 --> 00:26:52.796 A:middle
to plug directly
into Apple News.

00:26:53.736 --> 00:26:58.016 A:middle
It provides functions like read,
list, create, update, search,

00:26:59.176 --> 00:27:01.436 A:middle
and also offers plug in support.

00:26:59.176 --> 00:27:01.436 A:middle
and also offers plug in support.

00:27:01.436 --> 00:27:04.266 A:middle
So if you want to
know more about this,

00:27:04.266 --> 00:27:06.966 A:middle
if you have specific questions
or are having issues getting set

00:27:06.966 --> 00:27:09.916 A:middle
up with the Apple News
API, please attend the labs

00:27:09.916 --> 00:27:13.866 A:middle
that we have a lab today, and we
also have one on Friday as well.

00:27:13.866 --> 00:27:15.916 A:middle
We'll have Apple News
engineers on hand

00:27:15.916 --> 00:27:17.456 A:middle
to answer any questions
you might have.

00:27:18.906 --> 00:27:20.936 A:middle
Alright. Third, let's
talk about plug-ins,

00:27:20.936 --> 00:27:22.696 A:middle
the third way you can get
content into Apple News.

00:27:23.676 --> 00:27:26.096 A:middle
So WordPress is one of
the plug-ins we offer.

00:27:26.096 --> 00:27:28.516 A:middle
We actually offer
several of them,

00:27:28.516 --> 00:27:31.416 A:middle
and the published Apple News
plug in is a really easy way

00:27:31.416 --> 00:27:34.666 A:middle
to publish articles directly
into News from WordPress.

00:27:34.666 --> 00:27:37.046 A:middle
It's also one of the most
popular integrations we

00:27:37.046 --> 00:27:37.656 A:middle
have today.

00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:40.546 A:middle
And so this is what it
looks like in WordPress.

00:27:40.546 --> 00:27:44.346 A:middle
As a, WordPress is a nice
simple authoring interface,

00:27:44.446 --> 00:27:47.496 A:middle
and there's an Apple News
section off to the right side

00:27:47.496 --> 00:27:49.286 A:middle
that gives you many
features you need to publish

00:27:49.286 --> 00:27:51.636 A:middle
in Apple News including
choosing which section,

00:27:51.946 --> 00:27:54.056 A:middle
adding a pull quote,
and, and other features.

00:27:54.486 --> 00:27:56.376 A:middle
So it's really simple
and very integrated.

00:27:57.906 --> 00:28:00.806 A:middle
We also support publishing
directly from Drupal,

00:27:57.906 --> 00:28:00.806 A:middle
We also support publishing
directly from Drupal,

00:28:00.806 --> 00:28:03.326 A:middle
which is a content
management software system

00:28:03.666 --> 00:28:07.636 A:middle
that many websites that you
use every day are powered by.

00:28:08.106 --> 00:28:10.296 A:middle
And so you can publish directly
from Drupal and Apple News.

00:28:10.906 --> 00:28:15.886 A:middle
And today we also announced that
Craft cms is also integrating

00:28:15.886 --> 00:28:17.926 A:middle
with Apple News, and
you can publish directly

00:28:17.926 --> 00:28:18.696 A:middle
from their system.

00:28:19.196 --> 00:28:19.966 A:middle
It's very exciting.

00:28:19.966 --> 00:28:23.276 A:middle
And then next, I'm really
thrilled to announce

00:28:23.276 --> 00:28:26.816 A:middle
in this session that we have a
brand-new Apple News integration

00:28:27.166 --> 00:28:30.296 A:middle
with Squarespace.

00:28:30.846 --> 00:28:33.736 A:middle
And so Squarespace,
as you guys know,

00:28:33.736 --> 00:28:36.206 A:middle
helps anyone build
beautiful websites online.

00:28:36.646 --> 00:28:40.986 A:middle
The Apple News integration lets
Squarespace customers really

00:28:40.986 --> 00:28:43.866 A:middle
seamlessly publish into Apple
News and share their brand

00:28:43.866 --> 00:28:46.736 A:middle
with the world, and, of
course, because of Squarespace,

00:28:46.736 --> 00:28:48.846 A:middle
it's really beautiful
and easy to use.

00:28:48.846 --> 00:28:51.016 A:middle
So, it's a really
exciting integration.

00:28:51.046 --> 00:28:52.966 A:middle
We're thrilled to, to
have them on board.

00:28:54.276 --> 00:28:57.646 A:middle
So integrations of these four
platforms make it really easy

00:28:57.646 --> 00:29:00.686 A:middle
to publish into Apple News using
the tools you already use every

00:28:57.646 --> 00:29:00.686 A:middle
to publish into Apple News using
the tools you already use every

00:29:00.686 --> 00:29:01.406 A:middle
day instantly.

00:29:01.696 --> 00:29:02.986 A:middle
So I really urge
you to go check them

00:29:02.986 --> 00:29:03.886 A:middle
out if you use any of these.

00:29:05.326 --> 00:29:09.086 A:middle
So next let's talk about
making money off your articles

00:29:09.086 --> 00:29:10.186 A:middle
and channels in News.

00:29:11.236 --> 00:29:14.436 A:middle
So News makes it really easy
to generate revenue using ads.

00:29:15.046 --> 00:29:17.486 A:middle
Now as a publisher,
you're able to sell ads

00:29:17.486 --> 00:29:19.496 A:middle
in a few key places
-- in your channel,

00:29:20.486 --> 00:29:23.516 A:middle
in articles, and
between articles.

00:29:24.216 --> 00:29:25.846 A:middle
And so one of the great
things about monetizing

00:29:25.846 --> 00:29:27.436 A:middle
in Apple News are
the business terms.

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:29.706 A:middle
So if you sell your own ads,

00:29:29.766 --> 00:29:31.956 A:middle
you get to keep 100
percent of the revenue.

00:29:33.656 --> 00:29:36.136 A:middle
And for the inventory
that you didn't sell,

00:29:36.366 --> 00:29:39.956 A:middle
you can have Apple backfill, and
keep 70 percent of the revenue.

00:29:40.506 --> 00:29:46.026 A:middle
So it's a, a really great,
a great way to make money.

00:29:46.206 --> 00:29:50.116 A:middle
One note, though, is that ads
in Apple News are only available

00:29:50.116 --> 00:29:53.976 A:middle
for articles delivered
by API at this time.

00:29:54.186 --> 00:29:55.996 A:middle
So a quick look at
some of the ad formats

00:29:55.996 --> 00:29:58.086 A:middle
that are available
in News today.

00:29:58.726 --> 00:30:04.676 A:middle
So we've got standard, we've got
double, we have large ad format,

00:29:58.726 --> 00:30:04.676 A:middle
So we've got standard, we've got
double, we have large ad format,

00:30:06.156 --> 00:30:08.976 A:middle
mrects in articles,
interstitial.

00:30:09.246 --> 00:30:10.136 A:middle
This is when you're swiping

00:30:10.136 --> 00:30:11.526 A:middle
between articles
in your channel.

00:30:12.896 --> 00:30:16.596 A:middle
We also have sponsored
native ads.

00:30:18.576 --> 00:30:21.336 A:middle
And then video ads, if
you have video content,

00:30:22.126 --> 00:30:24.316 A:middle
and this is what they
look like on iPad.

00:30:24.406 --> 00:30:26.976 A:middle
So they're really simple, and
they really enhance the content.

00:30:27.886 --> 00:30:29.336 A:middle
So a few things to think

00:30:29.336 --> 00:30:31.986 A:middle
about when you're
monetizing and using ads.

00:30:32.336 --> 00:30:33.576 A:middle
Avoid some common mistakes.

00:30:33.576 --> 00:30:35.546 A:middle
Keeping, keeping an
eye on the settings

00:30:35.546 --> 00:30:37.196 A:middle
that you have for your ads.

00:30:37.196 --> 00:30:42.766 A:middle
If, for example, you've booked
a campaign for, for double ads,

00:30:42.766 --> 00:30:44.656 A:middle
and you have mrects
in your articles.

00:30:44.846 --> 00:30:47.026 A:middle
Those, obviously, aren't going
to deliver, and so you want

00:30:47.026 --> 00:30:48.746 A:middle
to make sure that you're not
making any little mistakes

00:30:48.746 --> 00:30:49.816 A:middle
like that.

00:30:50.076 --> 00:30:54.446 A:middle
You also should enable backfill
where you're not planning

00:30:54.446 --> 00:30:56.716 A:middle
on selling ads, but you should
really sell your own ads

00:30:56.716 --> 00:30:57.216 A:middle
if you can.

00:30:57.596 --> 00:30:59.746 A:middle
That's the best way to
make money in News today.

00:31:01.346 --> 00:31:03.906 A:middle
Also, we also give
you the ability

00:31:03.906 --> 00:31:08.276 A:middle
to exclude certain categories
of ads in your channel,

00:31:08.656 --> 00:31:10.536 A:middle
but if you exclude too
many, you're going to end

00:31:10.536 --> 00:31:14.376 A:middle
up with too low of an ad
supply, and so only exclude

00:31:14.376 --> 00:31:17.546 A:middle
where you need to so you don't
cut yourself out of revenue.

00:31:18.506 --> 00:31:21.426 A:middle
You can also experiment
with larger ad formats.

00:31:21.606 --> 00:31:23.546 A:middle
We found out the larger ad
formats have much higher

00:31:23.546 --> 00:31:24.336 A:middle
click-through rates.

00:31:24.426 --> 00:31:26.676 A:middle
So think about things
like the interstitial ads.

00:31:27.286 --> 00:31:29.176 A:middle
And then consider video
free role if you're finding

00:31:29.176 --> 00:31:31.456 A:middle
that users are engaging
with your video content.

00:31:32.616 --> 00:31:36.116 A:middle
And so we have a tool that's
made for managing your ads

00:31:36.326 --> 00:31:37.466 A:middle
which is called Workbench.

00:31:37.956 --> 00:31:40.326 A:middle
And so you can do a couple
main things with this.

00:31:40.326 --> 00:31:42.166 A:middle
First, you can monitor
the News revenue

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:44.506 A:middle
for the campaigns you
already have set up.

00:31:44.506 --> 00:31:46.316 A:middle
It's really easy to keep
an eye on things there,

00:31:46.316 --> 00:31:48.256 A:middle
and you can also
set up campaigns.

00:31:48.256 --> 00:31:50.066 A:middle
You can book, manage, report

00:31:50.336 --> 00:31:53.226 A:middle
on individual campaigns
right from Workbench.

00:31:53.226 --> 00:31:55.706 A:middle
It's a really simple
and intuitive tool.

00:31:57.606 --> 00:31:59.536 A:middle
Next, analytics and insight.

00:32:00.106 --> 00:32:03.576 A:middle
So we offer powerful
analytics tools in News.

00:32:03.846 --> 00:32:05.336 A:middle
Once you've started
delivering articles,

00:32:05.336 --> 00:32:07.196 A:middle
you can get some great insight

00:32:07.196 --> 00:32:08.816 A:middle
on how your content
is performing,

00:32:08.816 --> 00:32:10.536 A:middle
which articles are doing
better than others,

00:32:10.536 --> 00:32:13.116 A:middle
how your traffic
looks like over time.

00:32:13.116 --> 00:32:15.616 A:middle
It's a really great
exclusive tool

00:32:15.616 --> 00:32:17.186 A:middle
for Apple News Format
Publishers.

00:32:17.586 --> 00:32:20.636 A:middle
We offer a dashboard that gives
you great at-a-glance insight

00:32:20.746 --> 00:32:23.986 A:middle
on the content performance,
and if you're a power user,

00:32:23.986 --> 00:32:25.746 A:middle
you can download the
raw data via CSV,

00:32:27.166 --> 00:32:29.026 A:middle
but Apple News Format only.

00:32:29.666 --> 00:32:32.516 A:middle
This is what the analytics
dashboard looks like.

00:32:32.516 --> 00:32:35.366 A:middle
This is a view of channel data,

00:32:35.366 --> 00:32:38.246 A:middle
and so you can see these are
how many unique viewers this

00:32:38.246 --> 00:32:42.846 A:middle
particular channel has over
the course of a few days.

00:32:43.986 --> 00:32:45.566 A:middle
So it's a really nice,
rich way to get a, a,

00:32:45.566 --> 00:32:48.506 A:middle
some sense at a glance of
how your channel's doing.

00:32:48.786 --> 00:32:50.686 A:middle
You can even see at
the bottom we have a,

00:32:50.686 --> 00:32:54.006 A:middle
a list of the best performing
articles in a given channel,

00:32:54.006 --> 00:32:56.166 A:middle
which you can sort
by several vectors.

00:32:57.806 --> 00:33:01.776 A:middle
And here's a chart for,
for a specific article,

00:32:57.806 --> 00:33:01.776 A:middle
And here's a chart for,
for a specific article,

00:33:01.776 --> 00:33:04.996 A:middle
and so this one shows shares
for a given day, and you can see

00:33:04.996 --> 00:33:07.056 A:middle
that they're split up
based upon share method.

00:33:07.116 --> 00:33:09.896 A:middle
So you can really get a sense if
your users' sharing via Facebook

00:33:09.896 --> 00:33:12.076 A:middle
or Twitter or messages or mail,

00:33:12.266 --> 00:33:14.056 A:middle
and that can help you
reach out to them.

00:33:15.616 --> 00:33:19.376 A:middle
And then, of course, if you have
an existing analytics platform,

00:33:19.376 --> 00:33:22.466 A:middle
and you want to pull the
data from Apple News into it,

00:33:22.586 --> 00:33:24.156 A:middle
you can download the CSV

00:33:24.156 --> 00:33:26.826 A:middle
from the analytics tab
right from News Publisher.

00:33:30.976 --> 00:33:34.306 A:middle
So we've talked about a lot of
different vectors of Apple News.

00:33:34.306 --> 00:33:35.306 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit

00:33:35.306 --> 00:33:37.496 A:middle
about how you can make
your content successful

00:33:37.716 --> 00:33:38.406 A:middle
in Apple News.

00:33:39.386 --> 00:33:41.886 A:middle
So there are lots of ways
you can drive readers

00:33:41.886 --> 00:33:42.516 A:middle
to your channel.

00:33:42.516 --> 00:33:45.216 A:middle
We're going to cover
three main ones right now.

00:33:45.386 --> 00:33:47.516 A:middle
So, first, you, you want
to link to your channel

00:33:47.516 --> 00:33:49.226 A:middle
from wherever you can
and drive traffic to it.

00:33:49.806 --> 00:33:51.896 A:middle
Use the promoted articles
feature, which I'll show you.

00:33:52.586 --> 00:33:57.066 A:middle
And then use conical URL's,
and we'll talk about what

00:33:57.066 --> 00:33:58.266 A:middle
that is in a minute, too.

00:33:59.856 --> 00:34:02.466 A:middle
And, in addition, we have a link
at the end of the presentation

00:33:59.856 --> 00:34:02.466 A:middle
And, in addition, we have a link
at the end of the presentation

00:34:02.466 --> 00:34:04.356 A:middle
to our Marketing
Guidelines page.

00:34:04.646 --> 00:34:06.606 A:middle
There's lots of information
about how you can,

00:34:07.086 --> 00:34:09.016 A:middle
can promote your
channel outside of News.

00:34:11.366 --> 00:34:13.286 A:middle
So getting the word out about
your channel is critical,

00:34:13.286 --> 00:34:15.496 A:middle
and make it really easy to
get the link to your channel,

00:34:15.916 --> 00:34:18.326 A:middle
you just go into News Publisher
under the channel info tab,

00:34:18.426 --> 00:34:20.085 A:middle
see that there's a
shared link link.

00:34:20.315 --> 00:34:22.886 A:middle
So you click on that, and
it brings up a dialogue

00:34:22.886 --> 00:34:23.946 A:middle
where you can just
copy your link

00:34:24.266 --> 00:34:25.485 A:middle
and then share it
with the world.

00:34:27.126 --> 00:34:30.335 A:middle
So we also have a
promoted articles features,

00:34:30.916 --> 00:34:33.025 A:middle
and so what this does is
when you promote an article,

00:34:33.025 --> 00:34:35.896 A:middle
it will ensure that every user
sees that article at the top

00:34:35.896 --> 00:34:37.356 A:middle
of your channel when
they visit it.

00:34:37.356 --> 00:34:40.326 A:middle
And then when they come back,
that article will start to move

00:34:40.326 --> 00:34:43.045 A:middle
down as you deliver more
articles, but it will ensure

00:34:43.045 --> 00:34:45.795 A:middle
that everyone sees it at the top
of your channel at least once.

00:34:46.036 --> 00:34:50.076 A:middle
And it also, make sure it
appears in the more from section

00:34:50.076 --> 00:34:52.565 A:middle
at the bottom of articles
that you delivered.

00:34:53.176 --> 00:34:56.976 A:middle
You can promote up to
three articles per section.

00:34:57.746 --> 00:34:58.976 A:middle
It's really easy to promote.

00:34:58.976 --> 00:35:03.756 A:middle
You just click on the little
star next to an article,

00:34:58.976 --> 00:35:03.756 A:middle
You just click on the little
star next to an article,

00:35:03.826 --> 00:35:08.006 A:middle
and then it moves up to the
promoted articles section

00:35:08.006 --> 00:35:09.026 A:middle
in News Publisher.

00:35:09.096 --> 00:35:11.386 A:middle
So you can always see what you
have promoted at a given time.

00:35:12.046 --> 00:35:15.506 A:middle
So a great way to add some
visibility to certain articles.

00:35:16.856 --> 00:35:18.386 A:middle
Alright. So, finally,
conical URL's.

00:35:18.756 --> 00:35:20.856 A:middle
It's really easy
to share in News.

00:35:21.016 --> 00:35:23.396 A:middle
You can just swipe
and tap to share.

00:35:23.716 --> 00:35:25.356 A:middle
In iOS10, we've made
it even easier.

00:35:25.356 --> 00:35:28.106 A:middle
You can, we have a share
icon on every single article.

00:35:28.136 --> 00:35:30.996 A:middle
So users will be sharing a
lot, and you want to make sure

00:35:30.996 --> 00:35:33.916 A:middle
that users can get to your,
your articles no matter

00:35:33.916 --> 00:35:35.036 A:middle
which platform they're on.

00:35:36.126 --> 00:35:39.276 A:middle
And so conical URL's are
essentially a link back

00:35:39.276 --> 00:35:40.806 A:middle
to your original website.

00:35:40.866 --> 00:35:45.116 A:middle
So if you have a website, and a
user shares an Apple.News link,

00:35:45.346 --> 00:35:48.626 A:middle
if you included a conical URL
when you delivered your article,

00:35:49.006 --> 00:35:52.706 A:middle
if a user visits that link on
a Mac or other non-iOS device,

00:35:53.006 --> 00:35:56.166 A:middle
it will redirect them to Safari
to your original web page.

00:35:56.676 --> 00:35:57.876 A:middle
So it's a great way to make sure

00:35:57.876 --> 00:36:00.546 A:middle
that users can read your
articles no matter what platform

00:35:57.876 --> 00:36:00.546 A:middle
that users can read your
articles no matter what platform

00:36:01.896 --> 00:36:03.936 A:middle
they're on.

00:36:04.036 --> 00:36:06.026 A:middle
And so it falls back
if you're on non-iOS.

00:36:06.406 --> 00:36:08.816 A:middle
And this is an example
of an Apple.News link,

00:36:08.816 --> 00:36:11.236 A:middle
and then its accompanying
conical URL.

00:36:12.816 --> 00:36:17.036 A:middle
If you don't have a conical
URL, users will see this screen,

00:36:17.036 --> 00:36:19.036 A:middle
which isn't an ideal screen.

00:36:19.346 --> 00:36:20.706 A:middle
And so if you do have a website,

00:36:21.226 --> 00:36:22.986 A:middle
you should include
your conical URL

00:36:22.986 --> 00:36:26.906 A:middle
so users can view
it on any platform.

00:36:26.986 --> 00:36:30.346 A:middle
Alright. So some of the
best practices overall

00:36:30.416 --> 00:36:32.086 A:middle
for publishing in Apple News.

00:36:32.426 --> 00:36:33.836 A:middle
Write great stuff.

00:36:33.836 --> 00:36:37.546 A:middle
Try to check for errors and
typos and things like that.

00:36:37.546 --> 00:36:40.216 A:middle
If you have errors or
problems with your text,

00:36:40.216 --> 00:36:41.616 A:middle
it makes it harder
for us to classify

00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:42.836 A:middle
and then recommend it to users.

00:36:43.456 --> 00:36:46.316 A:middle
So really make sure you're
writing the best quality

00:36:46.316 --> 00:36:46.706 A:middle
you can.

00:36:47.226 --> 00:36:50.156 A:middle
Deliver high-resolution
images and use galleries.

00:36:50.516 --> 00:36:53.946 A:middle
Nothing drives engagement
like great visual content.

00:36:54.496 --> 00:36:57.166 A:middle
Use Rich Text and pull quotes,
animations and parallax.

00:36:57.166 --> 00:36:58.706 A:middle
Anything else that Apple
News Format lets you do

00:36:58.706 --> 00:36:59.676 A:middle
and be creative.

00:36:59.676 --> 00:37:02.546 A:middle
There are so many interesting
cool tools you can use.

00:36:59.676 --> 00:37:02.546 A:middle
There are so many interesting
cool tools you can use.

00:37:02.796 --> 00:37:05.156 A:middle
Dig around in the documentation,
and see what else you can do.

00:37:05.536 --> 00:37:08.856 A:middle
We really recommend that you
spend some time creating great,

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:09.616 A:middle
great articles.

00:37:09.616 --> 00:37:12.856 A:middle
And then use Apple.News
when linking,

00:37:12.986 --> 00:37:14.686 A:middle
but use conical URL's
when you can.

00:37:15.406 --> 00:37:18.376 A:middle
And then we also recommend
having a somewhat consistent

00:37:18.376 --> 00:37:21.936 A:middle
publishing cadence so
users know what to expect

00:37:22.146 --> 00:37:23.856 A:middle
if you're publishing
on a regular basis.

00:37:24.166 --> 00:37:25.136 A:middle
They'll come back
to your channel

00:37:25.136 --> 00:37:26.346 A:middle
on a regular basis as well.

00:37:28.216 --> 00:37:32.676 A:middle
And so Apple News is very much
an Apple app, and we love great,

00:37:32.916 --> 00:37:36.686 A:middle
beautiful, and inspired stories,
and we have many actual humans

00:37:36.686 --> 00:37:40.286 A:middle
on the Apple News team, the
editorial team who go through

00:37:40.286 --> 00:37:43.046 A:middle
and look for amazing
Apple News format content.

00:37:43.326 --> 00:37:44.876 A:middle
They're looking for the
best stuff to feature,

00:37:45.466 --> 00:37:47.886 A:middle
and so we encourage you to
be creative and ambitious

00:37:47.886 --> 00:37:48.806 A:middle
with what you publish,

00:37:48.806 --> 00:37:51.556 A:middle
and if you're doing great
engaging Apple News Format

00:37:51.556 --> 00:37:54.356 A:middle
stories, our editors may notice,
and they might promote you

00:37:54.356 --> 00:37:55.436 A:middle
and help you find
the new audience

00:37:55.436 --> 00:37:57.006 A:middle
that you wouldn't
have otherwise found.

00:37:57.006 --> 00:37:59.886 A:middle
So a few places we do
this are in top stories,

00:38:00.516 --> 00:38:03.826 A:middle
in our new Featured
Story section in iOS 10,

00:38:04.416 --> 00:38:08.556 A:middle
in the Explore tab, in the
recommended widget, and for you.

00:38:08.986 --> 00:38:11.656 A:middle
We also have an Apple News
Twitter account where we tweet

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:12.766 A:middle
out some of the best articles

00:38:12.766 --> 00:38:14.166 A:middle
that have been published
throughout the day,

00:38:14.376 --> 00:38:17.466 A:middle
and then we have a weekly
e-mail that we send out to many,

00:38:17.466 --> 00:38:21.026 A:middle
many users, and it's another
great venue to be discovered.

00:38:22.616 --> 00:38:24.786 A:middle
So some homework to do.

00:38:25.336 --> 00:38:27.946 A:middle
So first you want to sign
up for Apple News Format,

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:31.296 A:middle
create a channel, and then start
publishing articles using either

00:38:31.756 --> 00:38:36.196 A:middle
your CMS via the Apple News API,
download and set up a plug in,

00:38:36.946 --> 00:38:39.646 A:middle
or you can author
in News Publisher.

00:38:43.126 --> 00:38:45.256 A:middle
So this is more information
about some of the links

00:38:45.666 --> 00:38:49.366 A:middle
and other places
in, in this link.

00:38:50.186 --> 00:38:53.656 A:middle
And then there's also a
related session on Friday.

00:38:53.986 --> 00:38:56.356 A:middle
This is an amazing session
dedicated to teaching you how

00:38:56.356 --> 00:38:59.426 A:middle
to create incredible Apple
News Format articles.

00:38:59.516 --> 00:39:01.996 A:middle
So I can't recommend this
session highly enough.

00:38:59.516 --> 00:39:01.996 A:middle
So I can't recommend this
session highly enough.

00:39:02.056 --> 00:39:05.026 A:middle
Casey and Dan will help
you make standout stories

00:39:05.346 --> 00:39:07.566 A:middle
that really engage and
delight your users.

00:39:07.566 --> 00:39:08.596 A:middle
They use some really cool stuff.

00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:10.616 A:middle
So I highly recommend
checking this one out.

00:39:10.756 --> 00:39:12.786 A:middle
So thanks, and I hope you're
having a great time at WWDC.

00:39:13.516 --> 00:39:16.000 A:middle
[ Applause ]
