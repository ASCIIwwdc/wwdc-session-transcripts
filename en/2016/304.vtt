[ Music ]

00:00:26.246 --> 00:00:27.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.056 A:middle
My name is David O'Rourke.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:29.856 A:middle
Thank you

00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:32.991 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:35.176 A:middle
I think we're at the midpoint
of the conference this week.

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:36.106 A:middle
How's it going for everyone?

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:37.836 A:middle
Been worth your time?

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:40.936 A:middle
I was told something just
before coming on stage

00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:42.206 A:middle
so that there was no pressure.

00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:44.386 A:middle
But apparently you've
all hit favorite

00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:46.506 A:middle
on this presentation
a bit too much.

00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:51.416 A:middle
And so thank you for that,
I hope it's worth your time,

00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:52.636 A:middle
and I think it is
because we put a lot

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:53.356 A:middle
of work putting this together.

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:55.826 A:middle
I want to set some expectations
for this presentation.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.596 A:middle
We will be going
over best practices.

00:00:58.006 --> 00:00:59.456 A:middle
This is going to
be an easy session

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:00.526 A:middle
for you guys to listen to.

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:00.526 A:middle
for you guys to listen to.

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.046 A:middle
You can put your laptops
down, there's not going

00:01:02.046 --> 00:01:02.976 A:middle
to be a lot of sample code.

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:06.276 A:middle
This session is to inspire
you as to where to invest

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:09.246 A:middle
in your future app so that you
can improve the marketability

00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:10.796 A:middle
and approachability
of your application

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:12.176 A:middle
for as many markets as possible.

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:13.886 A:middle
The two markets we're focusing

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:16.156 A:middle
on for this presentation will
be business and education.

00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:18.436 A:middle
So spoiler, there's
going to be a lot

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:19.986 A:middle
of us going over Shared iPad.

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:23.296 A:middle
So let's get started,
we'll go into the agenda.

00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:26.416 A:middle
We're going to talk about
modern app design practices,

00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:29.036 A:middle
what some sorts of things
customers can be looking for.

00:01:30.236 --> 00:01:32.136 A:middle
We're then going to branch

00:01:32.136 --> 00:01:34.706 A:middle
out to a quick overview
of the Shared iPad.

00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:36.086 A:middle
How does it work
behind the scenes?

00:01:36.086 --> 00:01:37.756 A:middle
What affect does this
have on your app?

00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:39.406 A:middle
What technologies do
you need to adopt?

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:42.316 A:middle
That's my third bullet.

00:01:42.796 --> 00:01:45.876 A:middle
And there are some
specific technologies

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:48.016 A:middle
that we'll be recommending,
and fortunately for you many

00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:50.896 A:middle
of those technologies have been
gone over after this session

00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:53.096 A:middle
or later in the week, so you
can come out of this talk

00:01:53.406 --> 00:01:55.586 A:middle
and go directly in to
hearing the gory details

00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:57.616 A:middle
if you're inspired
to modify your app.

00:01:58.356 --> 00:01:59.606 A:middle
And there's some
new opportunities

00:01:59.606 --> 00:02:01.246 A:middle
to enhance your app, one
that I'm particularly excited


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.606 --> 00:02:01.246 A:middle
to enhance your app, one
that I'm particularly excited

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.596 A:middle
about at the end of
the presentation,

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.586 A:middle
and I think you will be
too because it will again,

00:02:05.846 --> 00:02:07.896 A:middle
offer you a greater opportunity
for your app to be used

00:02:07.896 --> 00:02:09.066 A:middle
in ways you never anticipated.

00:02:10.126 --> 00:02:12.366 A:middle
So let's talk about
modernizing your application.

00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:15.846 A:middle
This is kind of a bedrock
expectation for customers.

00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:19.016 A:middle
We talked to a lot of customers,
they give us a lot of feedback.

00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:20.756 A:middle
It's really strange
when they come up to us

00:02:20.756 --> 00:02:21.926 A:middle
and say why doesn't such

00:02:21.926 --> 00:02:24.436 A:middle
and such an app use
this Apple technology?

00:02:24.536 --> 00:02:27.466 A:middle
So I just want, this is not a
deep insight, but I just want

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:29.566 A:middle
to remind you guys, you
need to stay current,

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.566 A:middle
you need to stay fresh because
the customers are downloading

00:02:31.566 --> 00:02:33.486 A:middle
other apps from other developers
that have that technology

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.316 A:middle
and then it kind of
provides a discontinuity

00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:38.946 A:middle
or a bad comparison if your
app isn't using the latest

00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:39.916 A:middle
and greatest that Apple offer.

00:02:39.946 --> 00:02:42.526 A:middle
I don't think I need to speak
to any of the developers

00:02:42.526 --> 00:02:44.596 A:middle
in the room, that's why
you're all here a WWDC to find

00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:47.376 A:middle
out what's new, but as a
general ecosystem issue,

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:50.746 A:middle
staying current has benefits
for you and your customers

00:02:50.746 --> 00:02:54.106 A:middle
and is an expectation
of your customers.

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:57.526 A:middle
So some example technologies,
by no means the complete list

00:02:57.526 --> 00:02:59.006 A:middle
of technologies that
you could adopt.

00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:03.686 A:middle
Auto Layout, this is still a
relatively new technology it's


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:03.686 A:middle
Auto Layout, this is still a
relatively new technology it's

00:03:03.686 --> 00:03:05.446 A:middle
been in several iOS
releases now.

00:03:05.446 --> 00:03:08.076 A:middle
But this really helps you
produce a universal app binary

00:03:08.076 --> 00:03:13.146 A:middle
that can work on an iPhone and
an iPad and it helps with a lot

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:16.386 A:middle
of layout rotation just a whole
bunch of things get taken care

00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:18.266 A:middle
of for you by Auto Layout
if you invest the time.

00:03:18.516 --> 00:03:20.356 A:middle
It even helps with
left to right.

00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:23.306 A:middle
I used to manage contacts
for the desktop and we moved

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:25.656 A:middle
to Auto Layout and we got
left to right to free,

00:03:25.656 --> 00:03:28.236 A:middle
which was a longstanding,
or right to left,

00:03:28.236 --> 00:03:30.206 A:middle
or the different language
directions for free,

00:03:30.206 --> 00:03:32.746 A:middle
which was a longstanding request
for the desktop contacts app.

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:34.826 A:middle
So, auto layout has helped
us, it's helped us internally,

00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:35.976 A:middle
it will help you guys.

00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:37.996 A:middle
Accessibility.

00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:39.286 A:middle
I was actually talking

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:40.816 A:middle
with a former co-worker
just before lunch,

00:03:42.516 --> 00:03:44.766 A:middle
make sure you have accessibility
in your application.

00:03:45.106 --> 00:03:48.306 A:middle
This helps people that couldn't
otherwise use your application.

00:03:48.306 --> 00:03:50.186 A:middle
And they get quite
emotional when they can see

00:03:50.186 --> 00:03:53.396 A:middle
that they can finally use an
app because you're offering apps

00:03:53.426 --> 00:03:55.406 A:middle
to a person that may not
have been able to do anything

00:03:55.406 --> 00:03:56.526 A:middle
with it prior to doing this.

00:03:56.526 --> 00:03:58.686 A:middle
There's some excellent
accessibility labs later this

00:03:58.686 --> 00:04:00.306 A:middle
week if you'd like
to look into it.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.686 --> 00:04:00.306 A:middle
week if you'd like
to look into it.

00:04:01.256 --> 00:04:06.026 A:middle
Swift. This is the newest
most secure, fastest runtime.

00:04:06.416 --> 00:04:09.526 A:middle
If you aren't looking at Swift,
looking how to adopt Swift,

00:04:09.526 --> 00:04:11.436 A:middle
go to the Swift labs this week.

00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:12.256 A:middle
I think you'll be impressed.

00:04:12.256 --> 00:04:14.286 A:middle
I'm impressed with the
language, it's truly stunning.

00:04:14.836 --> 00:04:18.196 A:middle
I shouldn't have to tell
this audience to adopt Swift,

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:20.745 A:middle
but it's again another
newer technology

00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:22.386 A:middle
that you should really be
looking at investing in.

00:04:23.176 --> 00:04:25.406 A:middle
AirPlay, particularly
in the education

00:04:25.406 --> 00:04:27.086 A:middle
and business environment,
conference rooms,

00:04:27.086 --> 00:04:28.516 A:middle
big screens behind
the presenter.

00:04:28.876 --> 00:04:30.256 A:middle
People want to share content.

00:04:30.746 --> 00:04:32.396 A:middle
If there's room for
your application

00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:34.576 A:middle
to directly adopt
AirPlay, do so.

00:04:34.946 --> 00:04:39.436 A:middle
If you can just make your app
look more interesting when it's

00:04:39.436 --> 00:04:41.736 A:middle
on AirPlay, maybe being able to
hide certain onscreen elements

00:04:41.736 --> 00:04:43.646 A:middle
when you're sharing
to a conference room.

00:04:43.696 --> 00:04:47.776 A:middle
Thinking about AirPlay as, or
a big screen as a destination

00:04:47.776 --> 00:04:49.516 A:middle
for your application,
you might want

00:04:49.516 --> 00:04:52.356 A:middle
to modify the UI a
little bit or have a mode

00:04:52.356 --> 00:04:53.676 A:middle
that the user can
put something into.

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:55.376 A:middle
Or you just directly
project AirPlay.

00:04:56.656 --> 00:04:58.826 A:middle
And finally 3D Touch.

00:04:58.826 --> 00:05:01.806 A:middle
This is perhaps the newest
technology, newest hardware.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:58.826 --> 00:05:01.806 A:middle
This is perhaps the newest
technology, newest hardware.

00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:03.836 A:middle
A lot of opportunity
to accelerate.

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.826 A:middle
I use my 3D Touch
on a daily basis.

00:05:05.826 --> 00:05:07.976 A:middle
It really has made the
OS quicker, snappier.

00:05:08.206 --> 00:05:10.186 A:middle
And whenever I run into
an app, I push hard,

00:05:10.186 --> 00:05:12.476 A:middle
and there isn't you
know anything happening

00:05:12.476 --> 00:05:16.346 A:middle
when I push hard it's a bit
of a discontinuity and it kind

00:05:16.346 --> 00:05:17.306 A:middle
of throws me off my rhythm.

00:05:17.636 --> 00:05:18.626 A:middle
So look into that.

00:05:18.626 --> 00:05:20.506 A:middle
Again, I want to emphasize,
these are not the complete set

00:05:20.506 --> 00:05:22.956 A:middle
of technologies, these are
just some examples of some

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:26.316 A:middle
of the newest technologies that
some apps may be lagging behind

00:05:26.316 --> 00:05:29.476 A:middle
and this will impact
your ability to market

00:05:29.476 --> 00:05:31.356 A:middle
and sell your app into
business and education.

00:05:32.586 --> 00:05:36.746 A:middle
So let's talk about a feature
that I have a lot to do with

00:05:36.746 --> 00:05:38.736 A:middle
and actually was able to with
a fabulous team putting it

00:05:38.736 --> 00:05:41.516 A:middle
together iOS 9.3
introduced the Shared iPad.

00:05:41.826 --> 00:05:44.536 A:middle
This is a huge game changer
for you as developers

00:05:45.236 --> 00:05:47.936 A:middle
and for education in
that we can deploy iPad,

00:05:47.996 --> 00:05:50.386 A:middle
the best mobile platform,
into schools

00:05:50.456 --> 00:05:53.006 A:middle
and they can now have
multiple students share

00:05:53.006 --> 00:05:56.076 A:middle
and iPad throughout the day
and for different classes.

00:05:56.416 --> 00:06:00.426 A:middle
This offers a huge market for
the developers in the audience,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:56.416 --> 00:06:00.426 A:middle
This offers a huge market for
the developers in the audience,

00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:02.486 A:middle
because if you can make
your app work better

00:06:02.486 --> 00:06:03.546 A:middle
in a Shared iPad
environment, you're going

00:06:03.546 --> 00:06:06.596 A:middle
to have schools licensing
your app in quantities

00:06:06.716 --> 00:06:08.626 A:middle
that had previously been
inconceivable to you.

00:06:09.706 --> 00:06:11.316 A:middle
So let's talk about Shared iPad.

00:06:11.316 --> 00:06:14.226 A:middle
It's introduced with iOS
9.3, it obviously continues

00:06:14.226 --> 00:06:15.416 A:middle
to be supported with iOS 10.

00:06:16.136 --> 00:06:20.206 A:middle
And the major goals was to
allow schools to buy a cart,

00:06:20.206 --> 00:06:22.416 A:middle
how many people have
seen iPad cart?

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:24.766 A:middle
They're kind of cool.

00:06:24.766 --> 00:06:27.186 A:middle
I saw one for the first
time about 18 months ago.

00:06:27.426 --> 00:06:30.296 A:middle
They load 60 iPads into a little
cart, they roll it into a room

00:06:30.296 --> 00:06:31.816 A:middle
and the students pull the
iPad out, they use it,

00:06:31.816 --> 00:06:35.236 A:middle
they put it back and then the
cart rolls to a different room.

00:06:36.066 --> 00:06:38.296 A:middle
A feature that was missing
until iOS 9.3 was the ability

00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:40.196 A:middle
for the students to have
a personalized experience

00:06:40.196 --> 00:06:41.206 A:middle
on each one of those iPads.

00:06:41.656 --> 00:06:43.376 A:middle
With Shared iPad they
can now have that

00:06:43.376 --> 00:06:44.736 A:middle
and that makes the cart
much more effective.

00:06:44.736 --> 00:06:46.486 A:middle
Lots of schools buy
fewer pieces of hardware

00:06:46.486 --> 00:06:48.046 A:middle
and spend more money
on the software.

00:06:48.746 --> 00:06:51.496 A:middle
I want to repeat that
they can spend more money

00:06:52.096 --> 00:06:55.166 A:middle
on your software because
they're buying fewer pieces

00:06:55.166 --> 00:06:55.956 A:middle
of hardware from us [applause].

00:06:57.156 --> 00:07:02.546 A:middle
So, the way you log in is
using a new Apple ID called a

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:57.156 --> 00:07:02.546 A:middle
So, the way you log in is
using a new Apple ID called a

00:07:02.546 --> 00:07:03.026 A:middle
managed ID.

00:07:03.026 --> 00:07:04.526 A:middle
This is Managed by the school.

00:07:04.846 --> 00:07:07.406 A:middle
They set their own user
list, they bind devices

00:07:07.406 --> 00:07:08.186 A:middle
to their organizations.

00:07:08.186 --> 00:07:10.616 A:middle
And only their accounts
can log onto the iPads.

00:07:10.616 --> 00:07:11.406 A:middle
It's really cool.

00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:14.096 A:middle
If you didn't go to Todd's
session before my session,

00:07:14.096 --> 00:07:16.406 A:middle
I recommend you review
it with the video source.

00:07:16.716 --> 00:07:19.006 A:middle
He talks a lot more
about Managed Apple IDs.

00:07:20.176 --> 00:07:22.986 A:middle
And finally, and
probably the thrust

00:07:22.986 --> 00:07:27.426 A:middle
of this presentation is a Shared
iPad use environment requires

00:07:27.426 --> 00:07:29.376 A:middle
the data be a Cloud.

00:07:29.376 --> 00:07:31.656 A:middle
So we've got the cart,
everyone understand the cart?

00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:34.496 A:middle
Student rolls the
cart in on Monday,

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:35.986 A:middle
pulls out an iPad, they use it.

00:07:37.336 --> 00:07:38.606 A:middle
Well Tuesday when the cart pulls

00:07:38.606 --> 00:07:40.156 A:middle
in they may not pull
out the same iPad.

00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:43.436 A:middle
If their data's not
been pushed to the Cloud

00:07:43.436 --> 00:07:45.896 A:middle
by your application, they won't
have the experience they had

00:07:45.896 --> 00:07:46.466 A:middle
on Monday.

00:07:46.746 --> 00:07:48.576 A:middle
They'll have a new iPad
experience on Tuesday

00:07:48.576 --> 00:07:49.556 A:middle
and that will depress them.

00:07:49.806 --> 00:07:51.326 A:middle
So we're going to talk a lot

00:07:51.326 --> 00:07:53.196 A:middle
about what technologies
Apple offers

00:07:53.276 --> 00:07:54.566 A:middle
and how Shared iPad works.

00:07:55.646 --> 00:07:57.666 A:middle
So first of all let me
give you a quick overview.

00:07:57.666 --> 00:07:59.646 A:middle
Again, I recommend you
review Todd's session.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:00.726 A:middle
There was a live demo of this.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:00.726 A:middle
There was a live demo of this.

00:08:00.726 --> 00:08:03.086 A:middle
I have some static slides
showing what a login looks like.

00:08:03.326 --> 00:08:05.816 A:middle
So a student pulls an
iPad out of the cart,

00:08:05.816 --> 00:08:08.606 A:middle
they see their grade, the
student that I'm going

00:08:08.606 --> 00:08:11.236 A:middle
to be demonstrating is
Mia, she's a fourth over,

00:08:11.836 --> 00:08:13.196 A:middle
fourth row down on the bottom.

00:08:13.396 --> 00:08:16.576 A:middle
Spent a lot of time with Mia
the past few weeks putting these

00:08:16.576 --> 00:08:17.186 A:middle
slides together.

00:08:17.186 --> 00:08:22.256 A:middle
So Mia taps on her picture,
Mia provides her passcode.

00:08:23.146 --> 00:08:25.536 A:middle
After she's satisfied that she
entered the correct passcode,

00:08:25.536 --> 00:08:27.786 A:middle
the iPad gets ready for her.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:30.276 A:middle
If she's used this iPad
before this screen is up there

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:31.616 A:middle
for a far shorter
period of time.

00:08:31.616 --> 00:08:33.166 A:middle
If she's going to use the
iPad for the first time,

00:08:33.616 --> 00:08:35.626 A:middle
this might take a little
longer as it downloads data

00:08:35.626 --> 00:08:36.816 A:middle
from the cloud to get her ready.

00:08:37.876 --> 00:08:40.186 A:middle
When it's done downloading
data form the Cloud,

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.775 A:middle
or the initial setup
data, Mia uses the iPad

00:08:42.775 --> 00:08:44.025 A:middle
for the entire class session.

00:08:44.025 --> 00:08:47.136 A:middle
She uses Pages, she uses Garage
Band, and she works with it

00:08:47.136 --> 00:08:49.106 A:middle
as her iPad for the
entire session.

00:08:49.706 --> 00:08:53.136 A:middle
When Mia's done, Mia logs out.

00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:56.846 A:middle
This is the opportunity that
the iPad has to push the data

00:08:56.846 --> 00:08:58.986 A:middle
up to the Cloud for any data
that wasn't being pushed

00:08:58.986 --> 00:09:00.306 A:middle
to the Cloud during the session.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.986 --> 00:09:00.306 A:middle
to the Cloud during the session.

00:09:00.826 --> 00:09:02.286 A:middle
And so we're going
to talk a little bit

00:09:02.286 --> 00:09:05.096 A:middle
about what technologies
Apple offers to do that.

00:09:05.436 --> 00:09:08.606 A:middle
So, all of Mia's data has to be
in the Cloud for this to work.

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:13.076 A:middle
Mia's using a different iPad
possibly from class to class.

00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:15.556 A:middle
My kids have six periods a day.

00:09:15.556 --> 00:09:17.456 A:middle
They might start in
science then go to math.

00:09:17.986 --> 00:09:20.386 A:middle
There might be a different cart
in each one of those classes

00:09:20.386 --> 00:09:23.236 A:middle
and so therefore their data
has to be in the cloud for each

00:09:23.286 --> 00:09:24.376 A:middle
of those iPads to be useful.

00:09:25.096 --> 00:09:28.866 A:middle
Even if they use the same
iPad throughout the course

00:09:28.866 --> 00:09:30.856 A:middle
of the day, or throughout
the course of a week,

00:09:31.326 --> 00:09:33.496 A:middle
the data may be purged by
the iPad because it may need

00:09:33.496 --> 00:09:36.856 A:middle
to expunge users from the iPad
to make room for new users

00:09:36.856 --> 00:09:38.316 A:middle
to log in throughout
the course of the week.

00:09:39.246 --> 00:09:43.266 A:middle
So, iOS provides four core
technologies that I'll be going

00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:45.306 A:middle
over later that you can
adopt, and be telling you

00:09:45.306 --> 00:09:47.436 A:middle
about a fifth technology
that you should be adopting

00:09:47.436 --> 00:09:50.046 A:middle
if you don't use any of
the iOS Cloud technologies.

00:09:50.546 --> 00:09:54.966 A:middle
But let's go over first a
review of the iPad expectations.

00:09:56.106 --> 00:09:59.266 A:middle
So, I get a lot of questions
about this from engineers,

00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:01.166 A:middle
both internally and
here at the conference,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:01.166 A:middle
both internally and
here at the conference,

00:10:01.166 --> 00:10:01.976 A:middle
we've been talking to people.

00:10:02.146 --> 00:10:03.336 A:middle
So what is Shared iPad?

00:10:03.766 --> 00:10:05.656 A:middle
Plain and simple,
it's a user switching.

00:10:06.136 --> 00:10:08.956 A:middle
So we are not allowing
multiple users to be logged

00:10:08.956 --> 00:10:10.916 A:middle
onto the iPad simultaneously.

00:10:11.166 --> 00:10:13.586 A:middle
There's only one active user
session at any given time.

00:10:13.586 --> 00:10:17.276 A:middle
For user to log into the
iPad another user has

00:10:17.276 --> 00:10:19.176 A:middle
to log out of the iPad.

00:10:19.776 --> 00:10:21.496 A:middle
So it's really user switching.

00:10:22.996 --> 00:10:25.576 A:middle
What do you as an
app developer see?

00:10:26.006 --> 00:10:27.536 A:middle
You see a single use device.

00:10:27.536 --> 00:10:29.846 A:middle
You do not know you're in
a Shared iPad environment,

00:10:29.846 --> 00:10:31.776 A:middle
you don't need to know you're
in a Shared iPad environment.

00:10:31.776 --> 00:10:34.736 A:middle
Nothing has really changed for
you as an application developer.

00:10:35.156 --> 00:10:37.066 A:middle
You don't need to participate
in this, you don't need

00:10:37.066 --> 00:10:37.966 A:middle
to do anything custom,

00:10:37.966 --> 00:10:39.506 A:middle
other than move your
data into the Cloud.

00:10:40.076 --> 00:10:43.566 A:middle
Signing out is the
moral equivalent

00:10:43.956 --> 00:10:45.326 A:middle
of powering the iPad down.

00:10:45.326 --> 00:10:47.776 A:middle
So your app has shut down, it's
not running in the foreground.

00:10:48.006 --> 00:10:50.636 A:middle
It's just like a
non-shared use iPad

00:10:51.006 --> 00:10:52.686 A:middle
when the user turns
the iPad off.

00:10:53.146 --> 00:10:57.016 A:middle
So if your app works well
between power cycles,

00:10:57.566 --> 00:10:59.396 A:middle
your app will work well in
a Shared iPad environment

00:10:59.396 --> 00:11:02.406 A:middle
as users log in and log out.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.396 --> 00:11:02.406 A:middle
as users log in and log out.

00:11:03.276 --> 00:11:06.626 A:middle
User data is cached
on the device.

00:11:06.626 --> 00:11:08.776 A:middle
Internally we started
educating people,

00:11:09.246 --> 00:11:11.366 A:middle
it's like volatile
cache, it's not volatile

00:11:11.366 --> 00:11:12.896 A:middle
when the user's logged
in, it's volatile

00:11:12.896 --> 00:11:14.286 A:middle
after the user's logged out.

00:11:14.546 --> 00:11:17.506 A:middle
So the data may be expunged
off the iPad at any given time,

00:11:18.016 --> 00:11:20.556 A:middle
but while you're logged
in it's a single use iPad.

00:11:20.626 --> 00:11:21.846 A:middle
The data's not going
to disappear

00:11:21.846 --> 00:11:22.636 A:middle
out from underneath you.

00:11:22.986 --> 00:11:25.346 A:middle
And caching has some obvious
benefits for performance.

00:11:25.616 --> 00:11:27.586 A:middle
It works for offline,
these iPads we expect

00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:28.806 A:middle
to be taken on field trips.

00:11:29.406 --> 00:11:33.456 A:middle
And the data will be purged by
iOS when iOS deems it necessary.

00:11:34.786 --> 00:11:38.736 A:middle
So we want you to move your
data to the Cloud so that Mia

00:11:38.926 --> 00:11:40.716 A:middle
as she's visiting different
iPads throughout the course

00:11:40.716 --> 00:11:42.966 A:middle
of the day and different iPads
during the course of the week

00:11:42.966 --> 00:11:45.016 A:middle
and the school year has
a consistent experience

00:11:45.686 --> 00:11:47.236 A:middle
on all the different devices.

00:11:47.616 --> 00:11:52.156 A:middle
The iCloud technologies
that we make available,

00:11:52.156 --> 00:11:54.636 A:middle
or some of the four key
technologies we make available

00:11:54.636 --> 00:12:00.706 A:middle
are CloudKit, iCloud Drive
NSUbiquitousKeyStore, KeyChain.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:54.636 --> 00:12:00.706 A:middle
are CloudKit, iCloud Drive
NSUbiquitousKeyStore, KeyChain.

00:12:01.336 --> 00:12:03.806 A:middle
And as an adjunct NSURLSession.

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:04.886 A:middle
We'll talk about why that's

00:12:04.886 --> 00:12:06.806 A:middle
on the list here later
in the presentation.

00:12:09.006 --> 00:12:12.836 A:middle
So, you're convinced, there's
a huge market for Shared iPad,

00:12:12.916 --> 00:12:14.966 A:middle
when should I flush my
data, when should I do the,

00:12:15.186 --> 00:12:17.996 A:middle
well the goal is for
you to flush the data

00:12:17.996 --> 00:12:20.266 A:middle
to the Cloud while your app
is still in the foreground.

00:12:20.266 --> 00:12:22.626 A:middle
So as Mia's making changes,
you're writing changes

00:12:22.626 --> 00:12:24.626 A:middle
to the CloudKit, okay you're
updating your Cloud document,

00:12:24.626 --> 00:12:26.636 A:middle
you're doing whatever's
appropriate for that.

00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:29.926 A:middle
You can sync data
during log out,

00:12:30.056 --> 00:12:32.756 A:middle
and you should sync data before
you receive the application will

00:12:32.756 --> 00:12:33.916 A:middle
resign active event.

00:12:34.506 --> 00:12:38.626 A:middle
But, generally we don't want
to put all the data syncing

00:12:39.366 --> 00:12:41.716 A:middle
up on the logout, it will
take the logout too long.

00:12:41.716 --> 00:12:44.636 A:middle
So you should be syncing
while your app's up to date.

00:12:44.636 --> 00:12:46.976 A:middle
You shouldn't be batching
this up to do it later

00:12:46.976 --> 00:12:49.196 A:middle
because you may not get
later if Mia logs out.

00:12:49.846 --> 00:12:53.156 A:middle
There is, if you adopt the
iOS technologies for CloudKit,

00:12:53.156 --> 00:12:55.136 A:middle
Cloud Drive,
NSUbiquitousKeyStore, KeyChain,

00:12:55.716 --> 00:12:58.616 A:middle
Mia's data can be synced even
when Mia's not logged in.

00:12:59.236 --> 00:13:03.696 A:middle
But, we prefer her to exit
clean with no dirty data.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.236 --> 00:13:03.696 A:middle
But, we prefer her to exit
clean with no dirty data.

00:13:06.696 --> 00:13:08.536 A:middle
So let's talk a little
bit about CloudKit.

00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:11.686 A:middle
CloudKit was introduced
in I believe iOS 8,

00:13:11.726 --> 00:13:12.606 A:middle
correct me if I'm wrong.

00:13:13.416 --> 00:13:16.236 A:middle
You can sync data, it's
taken care of automatically

00:13:16.806 --> 00:13:19.326 A:middle
and something that's very
important that you adopt,

00:13:19.326 --> 00:13:21.896 A:middle
if you adopt CloudKit
is LongLivedOperations.

00:13:22.326 --> 00:13:25.596 A:middle
These are a subclass
of CKOperation Classes.

00:13:25.786 --> 00:13:30.356 A:middle
The link to the developer
documentation is on screen.

00:13:30.356 --> 00:13:32.006 A:middle
This is important
if you want CloudKit

00:13:32.006 --> 00:13:34.216 A:middle
to sync your data while the
app is not in foreground.

00:13:34.596 --> 00:13:36.716 A:middle
Now, we 've had this feature
and this wasn't unique

00:13:36.746 --> 00:13:41.446 A:middle
to Shared iPad, but we've
leveraged this feature

00:13:41.576 --> 00:13:44.176 A:middle
to also be the mechanism
by which we sync data

00:13:44.176 --> 00:13:46.126 A:middle
when Mia's no longer
logged onto the device.

00:13:46.606 --> 00:13:48.566 A:middle
So if you most your
CloudKit documents

00:13:48.566 --> 00:13:52.156 A:middle
onto LongLivedOperations,
you can get your data

00:13:52.156 --> 00:13:54.956 A:middle
to sync using CloudKit even
when your app's not running,

00:13:54.956 --> 00:13:57.706 A:middle
or in the foreground, or even
when Mia's no longer logged in.

00:13:57.976 --> 00:14:01.716 A:middle
So, if you're going to adopt
CloudKit and you're going


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:57.976 --> 00:14:01.716 A:middle
So, if you're going to adopt
CloudKit and you're going

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:04.366 A:middle
to use CloudKit, I highly
recommend you invest and work

00:14:04.366 --> 00:14:06.016 A:middle
with the CloudKit engineers
while you're here this week,

00:14:06.226 --> 00:14:07.836 A:middle
to understand
LongLivedOperations,

00:14:08.046 --> 00:14:11.706 A:middle
adopt LongLivedOperations, and
make your application compatible

00:14:11.706 --> 00:14:13.496 A:middle
with LongLivedOperations.

00:14:14.436 --> 00:14:17.236 A:middle
Cloud Documents is perhaps
the easiest API to adopt,

00:14:17.236 --> 00:14:20.616 A:middle
for document-based applications
like Keynote or Pages.

00:14:20.616 --> 00:14:21.956 A:middle
There's very little
you need to do,

00:14:21.956 --> 00:14:24.116 A:middle
every managed IP
has an iCloud drive.

00:14:24.586 --> 00:14:26.186 A:middle
iCloud drives automatically
sync.

00:14:26.606 --> 00:14:29.006 A:middle
If you are already a
document based application,

00:14:29.146 --> 00:14:31.156 A:middle
you're good to go for education,

00:14:31.156 --> 00:14:32.616 A:middle
you've done everything
you need to do.

00:14:32.966 --> 00:14:36.176 A:middle
And Mia will have all of your
documents for your app available

00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:37.686 A:middle
on every device that she visits.

00:14:38.026 --> 00:14:39.206 A:middle
So it's simple and easy.

00:14:39.466 --> 00:14:41.536 A:middle
If you're a document-based
application this is the

00:14:41.536 --> 00:14:42.506 A:middle
preferred way to go.

00:14:44.606 --> 00:14:46.506 A:middle
Both of these texts
are sync on demand.

00:14:46.506 --> 00:14:48.396 A:middle
And this is really,
really important.

00:14:48.396 --> 00:14:51.856 A:middle
Mia could have several
gigabytes worth of data stored

00:14:51.856 --> 00:14:54.236 A:middle
in CloudKit, but she
will only page the data

00:14:54.236 --> 00:14:56.406 A:middle
onto the device that
she accesses.

00:14:56.906 --> 00:15:00.426 A:middle
So the device does not have
to download all 2 gigabytes


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:56.906 --> 00:15:00.426 A:middle
So the device does not have
to download all 2 gigabytes

00:15:00.426 --> 00:15:03.106 A:middle
of Mia's Cloud data in order
for her to use your app,

00:15:03.106 --> 00:15:05.716 A:middle
if your app's only accessing
a few megabytes' worth of data

00:15:05.716 --> 00:15:06.546 A:middle
that you stored in Cloud data,

00:15:06.756 --> 00:15:09.016 A:middle
only your app data would
be pulled onto the device

00:15:09.016 --> 00:15:11.076 A:middle
when your app is launched on
that device for the first time.

00:15:11.166 --> 00:15:14.666 A:middle
So it's very efficient, and if
you think about this at scale,

00:15:14.846 --> 00:15:17.846 A:middle
average US classroom has
30 to 40 students in it,

00:15:17.846 --> 00:15:20.206 A:middle
you've got 30 iPads
all fetching data.

00:15:20.206 --> 00:15:23.256 A:middle
If they all fetch the full 2
gigabytes when they logged on,

00:15:23.666 --> 00:15:24.746 A:middle
it would be relatively hard

00:15:24.746 --> 00:15:26.716 A:middle
for most schools' network
connections to handle that.

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:30.126 A:middle
So these are the best
[inaudible] technologies,

00:15:30.126 --> 00:15:33.346 A:middle
they only cache the data you
use, the data stored locally.

00:15:33.676 --> 00:15:36.116 A:middle
They're really, really
world-class Cloud technologies

00:15:36.116 --> 00:15:38.136 A:middle
that you can integrate into
your app and get your app

00:15:38.176 --> 00:15:40.076 A:middle
into these important markets.

00:15:41.256 --> 00:15:44.446 A:middle
And CloudKit is suitable
for large datasets.

00:15:44.776 --> 00:15:47.246 A:middle
I don't know what the
definition of large is,

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:49.356 A:middle
I would recommend you work
with the CloudKit folks to find

00:15:49.356 --> 00:15:50.476 A:middle
out if your dataset's too large.

00:15:50.476 --> 00:15:53.706 A:middle
I don't think they recommend it
for use of iMovie, but maybe.

00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:56.886 A:middle
Maybe for smaller
datasets it would be fine.

00:15:57.426 --> 00:16:01.036 A:middle
I specifically got this quote
from the CloudKit lead engineer,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:57.426 --> 00:16:01.036 A:middle
I specifically got this quote
from the CloudKit lead engineer,

00:16:01.826 --> 00:16:03.986 A:middle
this is in contrast to
the next technology that's

00:16:03.986 --> 00:16:06.756 A:middle
on the next slide, which is
NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore,

00:16:07.156 --> 00:16:08.956 A:middle
which is meant for
smaller datasets.

00:16:08.956 --> 00:16:10.076 A:middle
So I don't think you need to,

00:16:10.076 --> 00:16:12.066 A:middle
unless you're doing a
video editing application,

00:16:12.066 --> 00:16:13.436 A:middle
I don't think you need
to worry about the size

00:16:13.436 --> 00:16:15.386 A:middle
of the dataset you're
putting in the CloudKit.

00:16:15.686 --> 00:16:17.826 A:middle
That doesn't mean
that you can run amuck

00:16:17.826 --> 00:16:20.006 A:middle
and do really silly
things for performance,

00:16:20.636 --> 00:16:23.576 A:middle
but most applications that
are going to store data

00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:26.926 A:middle
that are reasonable, CloudKits
are perfectly suitable for that.

00:16:27.456 --> 00:16:30.076 A:middle
Let's talk about
NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.

00:16:30.576 --> 00:16:32.426 A:middle
To use this requires
an entitlement.

00:16:33.136 --> 00:16:35.416 A:middle
It's a drop-in replacement
for NSUser default.

00:16:35.416 --> 00:16:37.836 A:middle
So if you're already
using NSUser defaults,

00:16:38.426 --> 00:16:40.476 A:middle
you're already good to go, it
should be fairly easy for you

00:16:40.476 --> 00:16:42.006 A:middle
to transition to
NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.

00:16:42.006 --> 00:16:44.326 A:middle
And NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore
the data is stored in the Cloud,

00:16:44.326 --> 00:16:46.346 A:middle
so your app launches, it
stores key values pairs

00:16:46.346 --> 00:16:49.856 A:middle
in the NSUbiquitousKeyStore,
your app quits, it relaunches,

00:16:49.856 --> 00:16:51.066 A:middle
it gets the data
back from Cloud.

00:16:51.096 --> 00:16:53.896 A:middle
Your app on a different
device will get the same,

00:16:54.786 --> 00:16:56.826 A:middle
essentially NSUser
default package

00:16:56.826 --> 00:16:58.296 A:middle
when it launches on
the other device.

00:16:58.296 --> 00:17:02.326 A:middle
It's modelled on
NSDictionary and again talking


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.296 --> 00:17:02.326 A:middle
It's modelled on
NSDictionary and again talking

00:17:02.326 --> 00:17:04.296 A:middle
to the CloudKit engineering
team,

00:17:04.596 --> 00:17:06.366 A:middle
who originally did
NSUbiquitousKeyStore,

00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:09.356 A:middle
moved on to CloudKit,
smaller payload only please.

00:17:09.356 --> 00:17:11.185 A:middle
This data is not
fetch on demand,

00:17:11.185 --> 00:17:12.316 A:middle
it is fetched during log in.

00:17:12.876 --> 00:17:16.195 A:middle
And we just really
anticipate this

00:17:16.195 --> 00:17:19.276 A:middle
for some lighter weight datasets
used within your application

00:17:19.276 --> 00:17:21.256 A:middle
that are more appropriate
for an NSDictionary.

00:17:21.256 --> 00:17:22.656 A:middle
If you put it in
a NSDisctionary,

00:17:22.656 --> 00:17:24.026 A:middle
put it in an
NSUbiquitousKeyStore,

00:17:24.026 --> 00:17:26.806 A:middle
if it's too big to put it into
an NSDictionary, you might want

00:17:26.806 --> 00:17:27.626 A:middle
to put it into CloudKit.

00:17:28.996 --> 00:17:32.206 A:middle
So, as I mentioned data fetch
is part of the account sign on.

00:17:33.106 --> 00:17:35.826 A:middle
There is a side effect of this,
and we're going to be talking

00:17:35.826 --> 00:17:37.136 A:middle
about later in the presentation,

00:17:37.276 --> 00:17:39.866 A:middle
which is this also prepares
your app to be managed

00:17:39.866 --> 00:17:43.656 A:middle
by application management,
which is the simplest summary is

00:17:43.656 --> 00:17:45.586 A:middle
to talk about deploying
applications in scale.

00:17:45.586 --> 00:17:48.416 A:middle
If I'm an IT administrator
about to deploy 1000 iPads

00:17:48.416 --> 00:17:51.606 A:middle
at a major Fortune 500 company,
and I want to have your app set

00:17:51.606 --> 00:17:55.126 A:middle
up under default circumstance
for the day 1 that I deploy it,

00:17:55.486 --> 00:17:57.046 A:middle
they do it through
application management.

00:17:57.046 --> 00:17:59.146 A:middle
And we'll be talking about
that later in the presentation.

00:17:59.626 --> 00:18:02.076 A:middle
Essentially you can get an
initial application state


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.626 --> 00:18:02.076 A:middle
Essentially you can get an
initial application state

00:18:02.076 --> 00:18:06.226 A:middle
distributed to all of the iPads
via NSUbiquitousKeyValueStores.

00:18:08.176 --> 00:18:11.816 A:middle
So, I want to think
of a couple use cases

00:18:11.816 --> 00:18:13.606 A:middle
for NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore
value

00:18:14.016 --> 00:18:16.736 A:middle
or NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore,
that is a mouthful.

00:18:17.336 --> 00:18:19.706 A:middle
The biggest thing
is is let's think

00:18:19.706 --> 00:18:23.476 A:middle
about Mia visiting an iPad,
day 1 of a new school year.

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:26.606 A:middle
She launches your app, your
app has some setup data.

00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:28.346 A:middle
You want to pick
her favorite color,

00:18:28.596 --> 00:18:30.626 A:middle
maybe have her pick a
picture for her Avatar.

00:18:31.776 --> 00:18:34.096 A:middle
You don't want her
encountering that on every iPad

00:18:34.846 --> 00:18:36.246 A:middle
that she uses throughout
the year.

00:18:36.336 --> 00:18:39.076 A:middle
So an idea use case for
NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore is

00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:41.016 A:middle
to story your app's
initial setup data.

00:18:41.666 --> 00:18:43.966 A:middle
That way as your app is
run on different iPads,

00:18:43.966 --> 00:18:46.776 A:middle
Mia's initial preferences
for your app have been saved

00:18:46.776 --> 00:18:48.186 A:middle
in NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore

00:18:48.876 --> 00:18:52.766 A:middle
and she does not see the
application setup every time she

00:18:52.766 --> 00:18:53.766 A:middle
encounters a new iPad.

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:56.886 A:middle
An example of places where
we use internal of Apple is,

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:58.716 A:middle
I'm told by the Stocks
team and the Weather team,

00:18:58.716 --> 00:19:01.186 A:middle
we use NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore
to store the ticker,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.716 --> 00:19:01.186 A:middle
we use NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore
to store the ticker,

00:19:01.506 --> 00:19:03.946 A:middle
list and we use it to
save all the locations

00:19:03.946 --> 00:19:04.896 A:middle
for where you save in Weather.

00:19:07.326 --> 00:19:10.586 A:middle
Keychain. How many people
are using the Keychain

00:19:10.586 --> 00:19:11.446 A:middle
in their application?

00:19:12.086 --> 00:19:12.496 A:middle
Quite a few.

00:19:12.896 --> 00:19:14.876 A:middle
I have excellent news
for you, you're done.

00:19:16.076 --> 00:19:19.136 A:middle
You need do nothing, you can
tune out for the next couple

00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:19.916 A:middle
of minutes and check email.

00:19:19.916 --> 00:19:22.246 A:middle
You don't need to
do anything else.

00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:25.066 A:middle
You're already good to go.

00:19:26.056 --> 00:19:28.036 A:middle
Every Managed Apple
ID has a Keychain

00:19:28.276 --> 00:19:31.126 A:middle
and that Keychain is synced to
every device that they log into.

00:19:31.586 --> 00:19:35.756 A:middle
Obviously the Keychain is
there for secure user data.

00:19:35.756 --> 00:19:40.316 A:middle
And so it's the same API,
same user conventions,

00:19:40.316 --> 00:19:42.626 A:middle
in fact you as an app
cannot tell the difference

00:19:42.626 --> 00:19:46.196 A:middle
between a Shared iPad Keychain
and a normal iCloud Keychain.

00:19:46.426 --> 00:19:48.066 A:middle
Same API, same usage pattern.

00:19:48.426 --> 00:19:49.826 A:middle
A couple of minor things.

00:19:49.826 --> 00:19:53.806 A:middle
Some people do some rare
application store device only

00:19:53.806 --> 00:19:54.966 A:middle
data on the Keychain.

00:19:55.146 --> 00:19:56.916 A:middle
There is no such thing
as device only data

00:19:56.916 --> 00:19:58.186 A:middle
on a Shared iPad Keychain

00:19:58.736 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
and we recommend you
only store per user.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.736 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
and we recommend you
only store per user.

00:20:01.256 --> 00:20:05.486 A:middle
And you must set the exportable
flag or the share flag,

00:20:05.856 --> 00:20:07.906 A:middle
otherwise your data will not
be shared up to the thing.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:11.346 A:middle
But you should be
storing user credentials,

00:20:11.346 --> 00:20:13.336 A:middle
or user sensitive
information in the Keychain,

00:20:13.666 --> 00:20:16.586 A:middle
you should not be using the
Keychain to store bulk data.

00:20:16.796 --> 00:20:20.716 A:middle
It's kind of the same rules
as NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:22.546 A:middle
Don't use it to store bulk data.

00:20:22.546 --> 00:20:26.536 A:middle
If you want to store secure
bulk data, come to the labs,

00:20:26.996 --> 00:20:28.506 A:middle
we can suggest some
different approaches

00:20:28.506 --> 00:20:29.456 A:middle
that will solve that problem.

00:20:29.826 --> 00:20:32.106 A:middle
But yeah, if you're already
using the Keychain, good.

00:20:32.676 --> 00:20:34.676 A:middle
If your app has user
sensitive data

00:20:34.676 --> 00:20:36.116 A:middle
that should probably
be behind a password,

00:20:36.116 --> 00:20:38.366 A:middle
or a little more secure than
just putting it in a data store

00:20:38.366 --> 00:20:40.846 A:middle
like CloudKit or
NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore,

00:20:41.196 --> 00:20:43.376 A:middle
start putting it in the
Keychain, it's easy to adopt.

00:20:43.376 --> 00:20:45.456 A:middle
It makes the data secure and
makes it highly portable.

00:20:46.946 --> 00:20:50.626 A:middle
Finally, on the Cloud
technologies to adopt,

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:54.136 A:middle
how many of you already have
your own Cloud technologies

00:20:54.556 --> 00:20:56.156 A:middle
that you're using
rather than CloudKit.

00:20:56.156 --> 00:20:56.906 A:middle
I see quite a few.

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:57.776 A:middle
Very good.

00:20:58.546 --> 00:21:00.626 A:middle
You need to make sure that
either your code or the code

00:20:58.546 --> 00:21:00.626 A:middle
You need to make sure that
either your code or the code

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:02.686 A:middle
that you're using
uses NSURLsession.

00:21:02.756 --> 00:21:05.906 A:middle
NSURLsession is the
preferred option

00:21:05.906 --> 00:21:07.616 A:middle
for doing all networking on iOS.

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:10.896 A:middle
And it should be using it
because it does so much for you.

00:21:10.896 --> 00:21:12.206 A:middle
I've been at Apple
quite a while.

00:21:12.206 --> 00:21:14.036 A:middle
I don't want to say how
long, I think a little longer

00:21:14.036 --> 00:21:15.726 A:middle
than Todd has from
the previous session.

00:21:16.456 --> 00:21:20.166 A:middle
It does so many things for you

00:21:20.366 --> 00:21:22.456 A:middle
that you don't even
know that it does.

00:21:22.456 --> 00:21:26.246 A:middle
It does IPv6, it does all the
metricing, and controlling,

00:21:26.246 --> 00:21:27.816 A:middle
and accounting, it
does data throttling,

00:21:28.166 --> 00:21:29.436 A:middle
seamless network transitions.

00:21:29.496 --> 00:21:30.956 A:middle
And, I didn't even
know about this

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.176 A:middle
until I was putting
this slide together,

00:21:32.176 --> 00:21:33.206 A:middle
Cisco Fast Lane support.

00:21:33.206 --> 00:21:34.406 A:middle
How many people know
what that is?

00:21:35.476 --> 00:21:36.756 A:middle
Yeah it's a quality
of service thing

00:21:36.756 --> 00:21:38.376 A:middle
that allows network
administrators

00:21:38.376 --> 00:21:39.966 A:middle
to prioritize network traffic.

00:21:40.516 --> 00:21:44.956 A:middle
And if your app is not
using NSURLsession you have

00:21:45.006 --> 00:21:46.446 A:middle
to do that all yourself.

00:21:46.446 --> 00:21:49.226 A:middle
That's time you're going
to spend learning something

00:21:49.226 --> 00:21:50.746 A:middle
where NSURLsession's
already done that.

00:21:50.746 --> 00:21:53.066 A:middle
So, if you're not going to
use CloudKit, you're not going

00:21:53.066 --> 00:21:55.156 A:middle
to use iCloud Drive, you're
not going to use the Keychain,

00:21:55.156 --> 00:21:57.026 A:middle
and you're not going to use
NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore,

00:21:57.026 --> 00:21:59.346 A:middle
but you're motivated to move
your app into the Cloud,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:00.396 --> 00:22:02.886 A:middle
make sure that the frameworks
you're using, or the frameworks

00:22:02.886 --> 00:22:04.706 A:middle
that you're writing
are using NSURLsession

00:22:04.706 --> 00:22:05.766 A:middle
for all of the networking.

00:22:05.966 --> 00:22:09.206 A:middle
And you will pick a best
of breed network behaviors,

00:22:09.836 --> 00:22:11.496 A:middle
robustness, and resiliency.

00:22:13.146 --> 00:22:19.666 A:middle
So, like the LongLivedOperations
in CloudKit, another advantage

00:22:19.666 --> 00:22:23.116 A:middle
of moving to NSURLsession is
let's go back to user switching,

00:22:23.396 --> 00:22:24.556 A:middle
your app's not in
the foreground.

00:22:24.846 --> 00:22:28.556 A:middle
Your NSURLsession pass are not
running unless you've marked

00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:31.596 A:middle
them as background, or adopted
background configuration.

00:22:31.716 --> 00:22:34.736 A:middle
So, you have your own Cloud
technology, you're not

00:22:34.736 --> 00:22:38.056 A:middle
yet on NSURLsession, but you're
going to move onto NSURLsession.

00:22:38.226 --> 00:22:42.086 A:middle
When you do so you can review
the developer documentation

00:22:42.086 --> 00:22:44.496 A:middle
that talks about how to make
your NSURLsession data run

00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:45.106 A:middle
in the background.

00:22:45.106 --> 00:22:47.726 A:middle
And this has two advantages
to you as an app developer.

00:22:48.056 --> 00:22:51.326 A:middle
Advantage number one, your
data can continue to sync

00:22:51.456 --> 00:22:53.146 A:middle
to your proprietary Cloud store

00:22:53.596 --> 00:22:54.936 A:middle
when your app is not
in the foreground.

00:22:56.006 --> 00:22:59.826 A:middle
And advantage number two, your
data will sync when Mia's logged

00:22:59.826 --> 00:23:01.896 A:middle
out and isn't even
active on your platform.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.826 --> 00:23:01.896 A:middle
out and isn't even
active on your platform.

00:23:02.756 --> 00:23:05.466 A:middle
So if you're not using
NSURLsession, start.

00:23:06.206 --> 00:23:08.556 A:middle
And when you do start
using NSURLsession,

00:23:09.236 --> 00:23:11.766 A:middle
review for background
usage and make sure

00:23:11.766 --> 00:23:14.036 A:middle
that your app can sync data
when it's not in the foreground

00:23:14.036 --> 00:23:17.576 A:middle
or the user isn't even active.

00:23:17.766 --> 00:23:18.646 A:middle
So, let's review.

00:23:21.056 --> 00:23:23.096 A:middle
By now I think I should have
convinced you Cloud based data

00:23:23.096 --> 00:23:26.666 A:middle
is essential for your app in
the new Shared iPad environment,

00:23:26.666 --> 00:23:28.106 A:middle
which we introduced
with iOS 9.3.

00:23:28.176 --> 00:23:29.826 A:middle
This is a huge market worldwide.

00:23:29.826 --> 00:23:31.416 A:middle
We know that it's being
used in Australia.

00:23:31.826 --> 00:23:33.246 A:middle
We know it's being
used it he US.

00:23:33.366 --> 00:23:34.506 A:middle
It's rolling out to Europe.

00:23:35.216 --> 00:23:38.396 A:middle
This allows Managed Apple
IDs to move between devices,

00:23:38.396 --> 00:23:40.176 A:middle
and we want that to be
as seamless an experience

00:23:40.176 --> 00:23:42.226 A:middle
as possible, and you as the
app developers have a role

00:23:42.226 --> 00:23:44.326 A:middle
to play there in getting
your app data into the Cloud.

00:23:46.486 --> 00:23:49.706 A:middle
Apple feels, and I believe we
provide a complete solution.

00:23:49.736 --> 00:23:51.746 A:middle
If you don't have any
of this working yet,

00:23:52.336 --> 00:23:53.856 A:middle
there's nothing you
need to wait for.

00:23:53.856 --> 00:23:56.376 A:middle
iOS has all the baseline
technologies you need

00:23:56.376 --> 00:23:57.596 A:middle
to move your data
into the Cloud.

00:23:57.666 --> 00:23:59.026 A:middle
If you don't feel that way,

00:23:59.026 --> 00:24:01.216 A:middle
come to the lab we'll
try to help you out.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.026 --> 00:24:01.216 A:middle
come to the lab we'll
try to help you out.

00:24:02.876 --> 00:24:04.856 A:middle
If you're doing your own
networking of any kind,

00:24:04.856 --> 00:24:07.456 A:middle
Cloud based or otherwise,
please use NSURLsession.

00:24:07.596 --> 00:24:09.136 A:middle
A huge amount of
advantages for you

00:24:09.136 --> 00:24:10.986 A:middle
in adopting those technologies.

00:24:11.356 --> 00:24:13.616 A:middle
And you pick up a whole
bunch of functionality.

00:24:13.616 --> 00:24:15.126 A:middle
And again we don't talk
about future features,

00:24:15.126 --> 00:24:16.126 A:middle
like Pod in this session,

00:24:16.356 --> 00:24:17.886 A:middle
but we're not done
with NSURLsession.

00:24:17.886 --> 00:24:19.906 A:middle
As we need more networking,
it's all going to get rolled

00:24:19.906 --> 00:24:22.116 A:middle
into there, and apps that are
already on it are just going

00:24:22.116 --> 00:24:24.696 A:middle
to ride that wave
onto the next round

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:26.696 A:middle
of feature improvements
to NSURLsession.

00:24:27.876 --> 00:24:30.796 A:middle
So, in addition to the Cloud,

00:24:30.796 --> 00:24:32.186 A:middle
there's some additional
considerations

00:24:32.186 --> 00:24:33.526 A:middle
for Shared iPad that
you need to do.

00:24:33.526 --> 00:24:37.666 A:middle
And this is more about
changing your thinking and less

00:24:37.666 --> 00:24:40.976 A:middle
about specific technologies
you need to adopt.

00:24:42.446 --> 00:24:44.006 A:middle
First of all, there's
data separation

00:24:44.006 --> 00:24:44.946 A:middle
between user accounts.

00:24:44.946 --> 00:24:47.836 A:middle
Now that should seem obvious, or
some people might be going duh,

00:24:47.916 --> 00:24:49.806 A:middle
but I want to talk about
that, because some apps,

00:24:50.016 --> 00:24:53.336 A:middle
iOS 9.3 is the first release
of iOS' for shared users,

00:24:53.336 --> 00:24:56.296 A:middle
and well that's 9 versions of
iOS prior to that that didn't,

00:24:56.296 --> 00:24:58.676 A:middle
and so some apps needed
to support shared users.

00:24:58.946 --> 00:25:00.756 A:middle
And they kind of wrote
their own little user picker


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:58.946 --> 00:25:00.756 A:middle
And they kind of wrote
their own little user picker

00:25:00.756 --> 00:25:01.486 A:middle
within their app.

00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:04.696 A:middle
So the first thing is, is we
have true data separation.

00:25:04.696 --> 00:25:06.286 A:middle
Mia cannot see Liam's data

00:25:06.286 --> 00:25:08.926 A:middle
and Liam cannot see Mia's
data while they are active

00:25:08.926 --> 00:25:09.646 A:middle
on the device.

00:25:10.036 --> 00:25:13.126 A:middle
Therefore, this is now a tool
you can use as an app developer,

00:25:13.126 --> 00:25:14.306 A:middle
to where you no longer need

00:25:14.306 --> 00:25:17.126 A:middle
to have your own app
or multi-user picker.

00:25:17.476 --> 00:25:20.086 A:middle
There are some applications out
there than when you launch it,

00:25:20.086 --> 00:25:22.106 A:middle
it says are you Mia
or are you Liam,

00:25:22.106 --> 00:25:23.346 A:middle
and you can set multiple
user data.

00:25:23.946 --> 00:25:26.086 A:middle
I think the time
has passed for that.

00:25:26.086 --> 00:25:27.986 A:middle
So if you are doing a
multi-user application,

00:25:28.426 --> 00:25:30.946 A:middle
your app should just run on a
single device, it should run

00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:33.276 A:middle
within the shared user mode
and you'll get data separation

00:25:33.276 --> 00:25:36.086 A:middle
for free and you can retire
the code that's doing that sort

00:25:36.086 --> 00:25:37.056 A:middle
of multi-user management.

00:25:37.576 --> 00:25:41.306 A:middle
And that avoids comingling
data between Liam and Mia,

00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:44.856 A:middle
which is sometimes a
potential privacy issue

00:25:44.856 --> 00:25:49.746 A:middle
if two different students
could see each other's data.

00:25:49.896 --> 00:25:51.286 A:middle
Shared iPads have quotas.

00:25:51.286 --> 00:25:53.746 A:middle
Todd had an excellent animation,
I forgot to rip it off

00:25:53.746 --> 00:25:55.476 A:middle
for my presentation,
my apologies.

00:25:56.226 --> 00:25:58.586 A:middle
iPads will enforce quota.

00:25:58.716 --> 00:26:00.626 A:middle
Now there are two types
of quotas on an iPad.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.716 --> 00:26:00.626 A:middle
Now there are two types
of quotas on an iPad.

00:26:00.626 --> 00:26:02.826 A:middle
There's the number of accounts
that can be on a Shared iPad.

00:26:02.826 --> 00:26:04.026 A:middle
That's like six, eight or ten.

00:26:04.546 --> 00:26:06.906 A:middle
And there's the amount of data
that can be stored per account.

00:26:07.066 --> 00:26:08.636 A:middle
Why does this affect
you, as you developers,

00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:11.016 A:middle
well you will be
getting new errors

00:26:11.016 --> 00:26:12.756 A:middle
out of any file system
operations you do.

00:26:12.756 --> 00:26:18.046 A:middle
There's the EDQUOT error,
treat it the same as ENOSPC.

00:26:18.516 --> 00:26:21.016 A:middle
So, instead of getting this
full, you'll get quota errors.

00:26:21.476 --> 00:26:23.576 A:middle
If your app has recovery
mechanisms you have to do

00:26:23.576 --> 00:26:25.636 A:middle
when you're out of disk
space, treat them the same.

00:26:25.716 --> 00:26:26.766 A:middle
But this is a new error code

00:26:26.766 --> 00:26:28.376 A:middle
that you might see more
frequently when running

00:26:28.436 --> 00:26:31.836 A:middle
in a Shared iPad environment.

00:26:32.966 --> 00:26:35.346 A:middle
Another technology that's
really, really interesting

00:26:35.536 --> 00:26:38.806 A:middle
in the case of Shared iPad
is On-Demand Resources.

00:26:38.916 --> 00:26:42.966 A:middle
If your app has On-Demand
Resources, or has assets

00:26:42.966 --> 00:26:45.136 A:middle
that you haven't moved into
Apple's On-Demand Resources

00:26:45.136 --> 00:26:46.716 A:middle
but that you download On-Demand.

00:26:47.596 --> 00:26:49.866 A:middle
If you're downloading them
into the user directory,

00:26:49.866 --> 00:26:52.296 A:middle
and you're on an iPad with eight
users, you've now duplicated

00:26:52.296 --> 00:26:53.516 A:middle
that app resource eight times.

00:26:55.116 --> 00:26:57.956 A:middle
Not only that, you've downloaded
the resource eight times

00:26:58.196 --> 00:26:59.686 A:middle
and that's burdened
the school's network,

00:26:59.686 --> 00:27:01.546 A:middle
multiply that times 30 iPads,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.686 --> 00:27:01.546 A:middle
multiply that times 30 iPads,

00:27:01.546 --> 00:27:03.736 A:middle
you've now downloaded
that 240 times.

00:27:04.706 --> 00:27:06.456 A:middle
So you really should
consider moving

00:27:06.456 --> 00:27:08.116 A:middle
to using On-Demand Resources.

00:27:08.616 --> 00:27:10.746 A:middle
If your app moves to
On-Demand Resources,

00:27:10.746 --> 00:27:13.636 A:middle
you will only download an
On-Demand Resource once

00:27:13.636 --> 00:27:14.456 A:middle
per device.

00:27:14.736 --> 00:27:16.966 A:middle
It will be downloaded
for all users, current

00:27:17.016 --> 00:27:18.426 A:middle
and future on that device.

00:27:18.656 --> 00:27:21.806 A:middle
And more importantly it will
not be deleted or purged

00:27:22.156 --> 00:27:24.166 A:middle
when a particular
user's account is purged

00:27:24.166 --> 00:27:26.586 A:middle
by the operating system to
make room for new users.

00:27:26.676 --> 00:27:29.246 A:middle
So if you have large
resources, or you have just

00:27:29.246 --> 00:27:31.166 A:middle
in time resources, or
you thinned out your app,

00:27:31.506 --> 00:27:36.036 A:middle
and you're downloading those
resources later, adopt ODR

00:27:36.366 --> 00:27:39.186 A:middle
and you will get the resources
you need onto the iPad just

00:27:39.186 --> 00:27:42.026 A:middle
when you need them and you
will minimize the amount

00:27:42.026 --> 00:27:44.446 A:middle
of impact you've had on that
iPad both local storage,

00:27:44.596 --> 00:27:48.456 A:middle
the user's quota, and the
school or institution's network.

00:27:50.016 --> 00:27:53.006 A:middle
So this is again a
screenshot form the developer

00:27:53.006 --> 00:27:55.026 A:middle
documentation, talking
about On-Demand Resources.

00:27:55.496 --> 00:27:57.066 A:middle
I have it at the end of
the slide, but I'm going

00:27:57.066 --> 00:27:57.836 A:middle
to give you a preview.

00:27:57.836 --> 00:28:01.196 A:middle
I think Thursday is
On-Demand Resources In-Depth.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.836 --> 00:28:01.196 A:middle
I think Thursday is
On-Demand Resources In-Depth.

00:28:01.746 --> 00:28:04.666 A:middle
Highly recommend you attend that
session if you have large assets

00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:07.026 A:middle
that you want to get out of your
app bundle and not download it

00:28:07.026 --> 00:28:07.906 A:middle
into a user directory.

00:28:10.776 --> 00:28:12.306 A:middle
Remote notifications.

00:28:13.256 --> 00:28:16.576 A:middle
Again, the iPad story and the
shared environment is a little

00:28:16.576 --> 00:28:20.756 A:middle
different here than it has
been previously, but not much.

00:28:21.336 --> 00:28:24.036 A:middle
Notifications work the
same as a single user iPad.

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:27.516 A:middle
So how does the Shared
iPad work?

00:28:27.516 --> 00:28:29.616 A:middle
It works like a single-user
iPad, but logging in is

00:28:29.616 --> 00:28:32.216 A:middle
like powering up the
iPad and logging out is

00:28:32.216 --> 00:28:33.586 A:middle
like powering down the iPad.

00:28:34.166 --> 00:28:36.596 A:middle
You won't get notifications
until an iPad's logged in.

00:28:36.596 --> 00:28:37.756 A:middle
And you won't get notifications

00:28:37.756 --> 00:28:40.256 A:middle
if an iPad's logged
out or powered down.

00:28:40.706 --> 00:28:42.366 A:middle
Same exists for log
in and log out.

00:28:43.676 --> 00:28:46.266 A:middle
So this is very much like your
app being turned on and off

00:28:46.266 --> 00:28:48.306 A:middle
on the device when the device
is powered up or powered down.

00:28:50.186 --> 00:28:54.386 A:middle
Remote notifications will not
be primed if your app runs

00:28:54.416 --> 00:28:55.726 A:middle
at least once per device.

00:28:56.136 --> 00:28:58.816 A:middle
So if Mia has only encountered
the device for the first time,

00:28:58.816 --> 00:29:01.126 A:middle
and your app relies on
push notifications working,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.816 --> 00:29:01.126 A:middle
and your app relies on
push notifications working,

00:29:01.126 --> 00:29:04.756 A:middle
or remote notifications
working, unless she's run

00:29:04.756 --> 00:29:06.286 A:middle
that app least once
on that device,

00:29:06.286 --> 00:29:07.626 A:middle
she will not see
the notifications.

00:29:07.916 --> 00:29:10.996 A:middle
This is just like a non-Shared
iPad, but I think it's going

00:29:10.996 --> 00:29:13.656 A:middle
to come up more often because
changing devices is now

00:29:13.656 --> 00:29:14.766 A:middle
so much more easy for Mia.

00:29:16.016 --> 00:29:18.316 A:middle
And signing out is like
powering off as I said earlier.

00:29:18.316 --> 00:29:20.736 A:middle
You will not receive
remote notifications.

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:24.146 A:middle
Why did we include a
whole slide about this?

00:29:24.506 --> 00:29:27.306 A:middle
I think there's some apps
out there that may not work

00:29:27.306 --> 00:29:29.336 A:middle
as fluidly or as
smoothly as you might want

00:29:29.916 --> 00:29:31.256 A:middle
without push notifications.

00:29:31.256 --> 00:29:34.136 A:middle
So if you have work flows
or use cases in your app

00:29:34.136 --> 00:29:36.506 A:middle
that really rely on
remote notifications

00:29:36.506 --> 00:29:37.776 A:middle
to trigger something,
something like that.

00:29:38.206 --> 00:29:40.506 A:middle
Think it through
evaluate your app,

00:29:40.836 --> 00:29:42.326 A:middle
and see what changes
you can make.

00:29:42.386 --> 00:29:45.236 A:middle
Because as Mia's moving
from device to device,

00:29:45.746 --> 00:29:47.916 A:middle
she may not get the push
notifications until she thinks

00:29:47.916 --> 00:29:49.106 A:middle
to run your app for
the first time.

00:29:49.496 --> 00:29:51.226 A:middle
And if there's something you
can do to help her with that,

00:29:51.226 --> 00:29:54.226 A:middle
or even just document for the
administrators making deployment

00:29:54.226 --> 00:29:56.196 A:middle
decisions about your app,
this will be very helpful.

00:29:57.516 --> 00:30:00.246 A:middle
So review your usage of
remote notifications and think


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:57.516 --> 00:30:00.246 A:middle
So review your usage of
remote notifications and think

00:30:00.246 --> 00:30:02.416 A:middle
about how well your app would
work if Mia's been working

00:30:02.416 --> 00:30:04.516 A:middle
on an iPad on it for
say a whole week.

00:30:04.556 --> 00:30:07.666 A:middle
And then she suddenly gets a new
iPad, will your app work as well

00:30:08.196 --> 00:30:11.886 A:middle
until she launches
it the first time.

00:30:12.086 --> 00:30:13.166 A:middle
Managed Apple ID's.

00:30:13.316 --> 00:30:16.106 A:middle
So this is a new
type of Apple ID.

00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:17.636 A:middle
It's set up by the institution.

00:30:18.036 --> 00:30:19.726 A:middle
The institution controls
the names,

00:30:19.726 --> 00:30:22.346 A:middle
the institution controls the
password, but there's also a set

00:30:22.346 --> 00:30:24.176 A:middle
of different capabilities
associated

00:30:24.176 --> 00:30:25.106 A:middle
with the managed iPad.

00:30:26.116 --> 00:30:29.936 A:middle
The most important that
it has is there are no

00:30:29.936 --> 00:30:30.826 A:middle
commerce features.

00:30:30.826 --> 00:30:33.596 A:middle
There are very few
schools, very few schools

00:30:33.836 --> 00:30:35.576 A:middle
that want the students
purchasing music

00:30:35.576 --> 00:30:38.206 A:middle
on their credit card when
they deploy their application.

00:30:38.206 --> 00:30:40.216 A:middle
So we've turned off the
commerce application,

00:30:40.786 --> 00:30:41.896 A:middle
the commerce and
stuff like that.

00:30:42.286 --> 00:30:46.146 A:middle
The impact for some developers
is I have seen some applications

00:30:47.036 --> 00:30:49.776 A:middle
put functionality
behind a pay wall

00:30:50.236 --> 00:30:52.316 A:middle
or put functionality
behind an in-app purchase.

00:30:52.316 --> 00:30:54.086 A:middle
Schools aren't going to want

00:30:54.086 --> 00:30:55.606 A:middle
to license an application
like that.

00:30:55.606 --> 00:30:57.076 A:middle
They're going to be
deployed into an environment

00:30:57.076 --> 00:30:59.216 A:middle
where the individual Apple
IDs don't have any commerce.

00:30:59.386 --> 00:31:00.926 A:middle
There's no credit card
bound to the account,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.386 --> 00:31:00.926 A:middle
There's no credit card
bound to the account,

00:31:01.336 --> 00:31:04.226 A:middle
your app cannot function
in that environment.

00:31:04.476 --> 00:31:05.956 A:middle
Now, I'm not saying
that you should do this

00:31:05.956 --> 00:31:07.906 A:middle
for your general app, you may
need to do a different app

00:31:07.906 --> 00:31:09.086 A:middle
for schools that you license

00:31:09.086 --> 00:31:10.846 A:middle
that don't require in-app
purchases just for it

00:31:10.846 --> 00:31:11.656 A:middle
to be fully functional.

00:31:11.656 --> 00:31:12.936 A:middle
And you should adjust
your licensing

00:31:12.936 --> 00:31:14.056 A:middle
and pricing appropriately.

00:31:14.476 --> 00:31:16.736 A:middle
But the app itself that the
school deploys should be

00:31:16.736 --> 00:31:17.436 A:middle
fully functional.

00:31:18.076 --> 00:31:20.436 A:middle
So don't want for
commerce activity

00:31:20.436 --> 00:31:22.696 A:middle
to happen before your
app is fully functional.

00:31:24.656 --> 00:31:26.506 A:middle
Also check for specific
frameworks

00:31:26.506 --> 00:31:27.446 A:middle
and features that you need.

00:31:27.446 --> 00:31:29.936 A:middle
Just don't assume that because
they have an iCloud identity

00:31:29.936 --> 00:31:30.846 A:middle
that they have everything.

00:31:32.266 --> 00:31:34.016 A:middle
We've combed through
the operating system

00:31:34.016 --> 00:31:36.476 A:middle
and where things are disabled,

00:31:36.476 --> 00:31:38.216 A:middle
those frameworks will
return appropriate errors.

00:31:38.216 --> 00:31:39.576 A:middle
A concrete example is StoreKit.

00:31:40.056 --> 00:31:43.386 A:middle
If you use StoreKit and you
try to use it while logged

00:31:43.386 --> 00:31:44.506 A:middle
on as a Managed Apple ID,

00:31:44.506 --> 00:31:47.126 A:middle
you will get an appropriate
error telling you StoreKit's

00:31:47.126 --> 00:31:48.306 A:middle
offline or unavailable.

00:31:48.576 --> 00:31:51.996 A:middle
So, don't assume
it's all or nothing,

00:31:51.996 --> 00:31:54.006 A:middle
if I have this then I have
all these other services.

00:31:54.006 --> 00:31:55.566 A:middle
Start checking for
individual frameworks

00:31:55.566 --> 00:31:57.496 A:middle
to be present that you need.

00:31:57.596 --> 00:31:59.316 A:middle
If those frameworks
were to return an error,

00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:02.176 A:middle
how would your app behave
and thank that through


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:02.176 A:middle
how would your app behave
and thank that through

00:32:02.176 --> 00:32:05.916 A:middle
for this type of use case.

00:32:06.256 --> 00:32:08.716 A:middle
Generally, you can follow the
existing practices you've been

00:32:08.716 --> 00:32:10.456 A:middle
following if you're
already compatible with VPP,

00:32:10.456 --> 00:32:13.906 A:middle
which is Volume Purchase Plan,
and device based licensing.

00:32:13.906 --> 00:32:16.466 A:middle
If your app conforms
to VPP licensing

00:32:16.466 --> 00:32:19.086 A:middle
and device based deployment,
you're already most

00:32:19.086 --> 00:32:20.956 A:middle
of the way there, if not
all of the way there.

00:32:21.336 --> 00:32:23.746 A:middle
But for developers that don't
know about VPP and don't know

00:32:23.746 --> 00:32:26.006 A:middle
about device based licensing,
work with us in the labs,

00:32:26.006 --> 00:32:26.956 A:middle
we can bring you up to speed.

00:32:27.196 --> 00:32:30.716 A:middle
This will make your app
more approachable and open

00:32:30.716 --> 00:32:31.666 A:middle
up new markets for you.

00:32:32.806 --> 00:32:36.066 A:middle
And finally a quick shout
out to web developers.

00:32:36.576 --> 00:32:38.646 A:middle
We gave this a lot of thought.

00:32:38.646 --> 00:32:39.646 A:middle
So there is a Keychain.

00:32:40.086 --> 00:32:43.506 A:middle
I love the Safari AutoFill
feature that saves passwords

00:32:43.506 --> 00:32:44.856 A:middle
and syncs them in
the iCloud Keychain,

00:32:44.856 --> 00:32:46.986 A:middle
it made it just hugely
useful when we deployed that.

00:32:47.236 --> 00:32:52.106 A:middle
But we're thinking Mia
logging on to a Shared iPad,

00:32:52.106 --> 00:32:54.816 A:middle
and then logging on
to a personal account,

00:32:55.526 --> 00:32:57.786 A:middle
we may not want that
password saved

00:32:57.786 --> 00:32:59.836 A:middle
in the keychain where
it's stored.

00:32:59.836 --> 00:33:02.106 A:middle
So we've given schools
the ability


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.836 --> 00:33:02.106 A:middle
So we've given schools
the ability

00:33:02.106 --> 00:33:05.436 A:middle
to list what particular
websites they want

00:33:05.436 --> 00:33:07.356 A:middle
to save passwords
for in the Keychain.

00:33:07.356 --> 00:33:09.436 A:middle
Now, consider moving
it to a native app.

00:33:09.496 --> 00:33:11.696 A:middle
This is overwhelmingly
the best solution.

00:33:12.226 --> 00:33:14.176 A:middle
And the solution that
our customers expect

00:33:14.176 --> 00:33:15.176 A:middle
and your customers expect.

00:33:15.696 --> 00:33:19.266 A:middle
If, however, you remain
a web-based developer

00:33:19.266 --> 00:33:20.206 A:middle
and web-based content,

00:33:20.406 --> 00:33:23.036 A:middle
at a minimum there's some
documentation update you might

00:33:23.036 --> 00:33:25.936 A:middle
want to remind your customers
to add your domain name

00:33:25.936 --> 00:33:28.906 A:middle
to the Safari domain whitelist
so that as the students set

00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:31.606 A:middle
up your site for the first
time, Safari will prompt them

00:33:31.606 --> 00:33:33.316 A:middle
to save their password,
and it will get saved

00:33:33.316 --> 00:33:36.526 A:middle
into their Managed
Apple ID Keychain.

00:33:36.916 --> 00:33:39.316 A:middle
And then the next time they
visit a different iPad and log

00:33:39.316 --> 00:33:40.386 A:middle
onto your website,
they won't have

00:33:40.386 --> 00:33:42.146 A:middle
to provide their
credentials a second time.

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:44.456 A:middle
If you do not list your
website or your domain

00:33:45.136 --> 00:33:48.336 A:middle
on this domain whitelist,
Mia would be forced to log

00:33:48.336 --> 00:33:50.026 A:middle
in every time she
encounters a new iPad

00:33:50.026 --> 00:33:52.316 A:middle
and that would be a
frustrating experience

00:33:52.316 --> 00:33:53.356 A:middle
for Mia and the school.

00:33:53.436 --> 00:33:55.386 A:middle
At a minimum there's a
documentation update.

00:33:55.426 --> 00:33:59.076 A:middle
At most, maybe use this as a
notice that it might be time

00:33:59.076 --> 00:34:01.366 A:middle
to consider moving your app
to be native on the platform.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.076 --> 00:34:01.366 A:middle
to consider moving your app
to be native on the platform.

00:34:02.466 --> 00:34:04.156 A:middle
I've been talking
about Shared iPad.

00:34:05.316 --> 00:34:07.436 A:middle
I've been talking
about business.

00:34:07.746 --> 00:34:10.106 A:middle
I've been talking about the
new markets that this opens up.

00:34:10.626 --> 00:34:11.646 A:middle
But I'm also going to point out,

00:34:12.255 --> 00:34:15.335 A:middle
there's nothing here that's
unique to Shared iPad.

00:34:15.335 --> 00:34:19.096 A:middle
My assertion is is that while
Cloud based data is required

00:34:19.096 --> 00:34:20.585 A:middle
for Shared iPad to
work functionally,

00:34:21.676 --> 00:34:23.106 A:middle
all of your users will benefit

00:34:23.386 --> 00:34:24.516 A:middle
from moving your
app to the Cloud.

00:34:24.516 --> 00:34:28.146 A:middle
My wife, just two weeks
ago face planted her iPad.

00:34:29.096 --> 00:34:30.976 A:middle
We took it to the Genius
Bar, they fixed it.

00:34:31.176 --> 00:34:33.446 A:middle
She got a new iPad, she
started setting up her apps.

00:34:34.376 --> 00:34:36.456 A:middle
The apps that didn't
get Cloud data,

00:34:36.656 --> 00:34:38.755 A:middle
didn't get reinstalled
on her app.

00:34:38.846 --> 00:34:40.946 A:middle
She just didn't have time.

00:34:41.085 --> 00:34:43.565 A:middle
And it makes it easy for
them to change devices.

00:34:43.565 --> 00:34:45.275 A:middle
So these changes that
you're going to invest

00:34:45.275 --> 00:34:47.366 A:middle
in are not just investing
for Shared iPad.

00:34:47.686 --> 00:34:49.735 A:middle
This will make it better
for all of your users.

00:34:49.735 --> 00:34:51.226 A:middle
All of your users
have Cloud data.

00:34:51.556 --> 00:34:53.396 A:middle
All of your users
have iCloud documents.

00:34:53.396 --> 00:34:54.896 A:middle
All of your users
have Keychains.

00:34:55.315 --> 00:34:58.106 A:middle
All of your users have
NSUbiquitousKeyStore.

00:34:58.436 --> 00:35:02.996 A:middle
Moving your application
data into the Cloud is going


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.436 --> 00:35:02.996 A:middle
Moving your application
data into the Cloud is going

00:35:02.996 --> 00:35:04.836 A:middle
to make it better for
your entire ecosystem.

00:35:05.126 --> 00:35:07.656 A:middle
And in addition to that
make it more suitable

00:35:07.656 --> 00:35:09.106 A:middle
for education and business use.

00:35:09.836 --> 00:35:12.626 A:middle
So business also
favors the Cloud.

00:35:12.626 --> 00:35:15.746 A:middle
They change devices, they change
employees, they hand new devices

00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:17.196 A:middle
to a different employee
on Monday

00:35:17.196 --> 00:35:18.346 A:middle
than was using it on Tuesday.

00:35:18.346 --> 00:35:21.866 A:middle
If you can make it more rapid
to set up your account and have

00:35:21.866 --> 00:35:24.336 A:middle
that employee's data
online and accessible

00:35:24.336 --> 00:35:26.646 A:middle
on that iPad sooner rather than
later, businesses are going

00:35:26.646 --> 00:35:29.276 A:middle
to consider your app a favorite
choice for them to deploy.

00:35:29.856 --> 00:35:33.236 A:middle
So, my argument is the
Cloud's a long term trend.

00:35:33.766 --> 00:35:36.106 A:middle
If you haven't considered
moving your data to the Cloud,

00:35:36.466 --> 00:35:37.446 A:middle
this might be the year

00:35:37.446 --> 00:35:39.666 A:middle
that that's finally no
longer a tenable position.

00:35:40.176 --> 00:35:43.216 A:middle
If you're already on the Cloud,
review your usage and make sure

00:35:43.216 --> 00:35:45.466 A:middle
that everything is working
well, because we just opened

00:35:45.466 --> 00:35:49.926 A:middle
up a huge new market for
you with Shared iPads.

00:35:50.746 --> 00:35:53.356 A:middle
So you've done all this, you've
moved your user secure data

00:35:53.406 --> 00:35:56.216 A:middle
into the Keychain, you've used
CloudKit to store the bulk data,

00:35:56.216 --> 00:35:58.336 A:middle
because you're not using
NSUbiquitousKeyStore for that.

00:35:58.806 --> 00:36:00.366 A:middle
You've used NSUbiquitousKeyStore


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:58.806 --> 00:36:00.366 A:middle
You've used NSUbiquitousKeyStore

00:36:00.366 --> 00:36:01.846 A:middle
to store your apps
initial settings.

00:36:02.516 --> 00:36:04.716 A:middle
And you took all your custom
networking you moved it

00:36:04.716 --> 00:36:05.966 A:middle
up onto NSURLsession.

00:36:05.966 --> 00:36:08.576 A:middle
You moved up background
tasks for it so that it runs

00:36:08.576 --> 00:36:09.556 A:middle
when your app's not
in the foreground.

00:36:09.996 --> 00:36:11.156 A:middle
Now you need to test it.

00:36:11.516 --> 00:36:12.776 A:middle
Make sure that it
all actually works.

00:36:12.776 --> 00:36:14.626 A:middle
So here's some high-level
recommendations

00:36:15.136 --> 00:36:16.236 A:middle
on how to test for the app.

00:36:16.616 --> 00:36:19.046 A:middle
And there are basically three
methods of testing that all boil

00:36:19.046 --> 00:36:21.516 A:middle
down to the same method, but
we'll go through them one by.

00:36:21.516 --> 00:36:22.396 A:middle
Two devices.

00:36:23.146 --> 00:36:24.536 A:middle
iPad a, iPad b.

00:36:24.536 --> 00:36:27.916 A:middle
You install your app on iPad
a, set up an iCloud identity.

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:29.056 A:middle
Run your app.

00:36:30.356 --> 00:36:31.956 A:middle
Go through the cycle
of storing your data.

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:34.156 A:middle
Maybe your stock app, you
store your ticker information,

00:36:34.156 --> 00:36:35.906 A:middle
you do all of that
sort of stuff.

00:36:36.576 --> 00:36:37.386 A:middle
Wait for it to sync.

00:36:38.156 --> 00:36:43.166 A:middle
Launch iPad b, log onto the same
account, launch your application

00:36:43.226 --> 00:36:46.056 A:middle
and see if your data
shows up on iCloud b.

00:36:47.016 --> 00:36:49.146 A:middle
If not commence the
debugging cycle.

00:36:49.326 --> 00:36:52.366 A:middle
If it does work,
great, you're done.

00:36:52.416 --> 00:36:54.886 A:middle
And that will allow you, so
basically two different devices

00:36:54.886 --> 00:36:58.466 A:middle
with the same iCloud identity is
all you need to test to verify

00:36:58.466 --> 00:37:00.456 A:middle
that your app's working in
a Shared iPad environment.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:58.466 --> 00:37:00.456 A:middle
that your app's working in
a Shared iPad environment.

00:37:01.186 --> 00:37:04.016 A:middle
If you don't have two devices,
or you just don't want to bother

00:37:04.016 --> 00:37:07.116 A:middle
with two devices, you can
do the same sort of testing

00:37:07.116 --> 00:37:09.076 A:middle
by adding your app,
setting up all the data,

00:37:09.536 --> 00:37:12.266 A:middle
waiting for the app to sync
the data, delete the app

00:37:12.266 --> 00:37:14.136 A:middle
and add the app back
to the device.

00:37:14.296 --> 00:37:15.886 A:middle
That will pull all
of the data back.

00:37:15.926 --> 00:37:17.636 A:middle
That will pull the
NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore,

00:37:17.636 --> 00:37:18.946 A:middle
the CloudKit, the
Cloud documents.

00:37:18.946 --> 00:37:19.966 A:middle
All of that data will come back.

00:37:20.506 --> 00:37:24.216 A:middle
If all of that data comes back,
again you can check off the box

00:37:24.216 --> 00:37:26.406 A:middle
that says you've moved
your data to the Cloud.

00:37:27.706 --> 00:37:29.886 A:middle
In an extrema case,
and most of you

00:37:30.246 --> 00:37:32.196 A:middle
in the audience realize
this is just a variation

00:37:32.196 --> 00:37:33.416 A:middle
on these things.

00:37:33.476 --> 00:37:35.756 A:middle
If you really want to know
that you've really nailed this,

00:37:35.756 --> 00:37:37.956 A:middle
you can erase the iPad
between testing sessions.

00:37:38.266 --> 00:37:39.386 A:middle
I don't think that's necessary,

00:37:39.386 --> 00:37:40.796 A:middle
but I just put it
here for completeness.

00:37:41.386 --> 00:37:43.506 A:middle
That's really kind
of the acid test.

00:37:44.046 --> 00:37:46.136 A:middle
Set up your iPad get a
whole bunch of data in it.

00:37:46.276 --> 00:37:48.236 A:middle
Trust that your Cloud
is working,

00:37:48.416 --> 00:37:51.026 A:middle
trust that Apple stored the data
for you, blow the device away,

00:37:51.326 --> 00:37:52.696 A:middle
set it up from scratch again.

00:37:52.696 --> 00:37:53.816 A:middle
Does all your data come back?

00:37:54.536 --> 00:37:55.136 A:middle
You're in great shape.

00:37:56.356 --> 00:37:58.456 A:middle
If your app can pass
that sort of test,

00:37:59.056 --> 00:38:02.876 A:middle
you have nailed the Shared iPad
case and made things better


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:59.056 --> 00:38:02.876 A:middle
you have nailed the Shared iPad
case and made things better

00:38:02.876 --> 00:38:04.116 A:middle
for your consumer users.

00:38:05.146 --> 00:38:07.366 A:middle
So verify all of your
app's functionality.

00:38:07.366 --> 00:38:08.736 A:middle
Verify there's no data loss.

00:38:08.736 --> 00:38:10.166 A:middle
Verify offline works.

00:38:10.166 --> 00:38:12.516 A:middle
So put the iPad into
airplane mode and verify

00:38:12.516 --> 00:38:14.756 A:middle
that your user CloudKit,
that all the data syncs later

00:38:14.756 --> 00:38:16.386 A:middle
when you take it out
of airplane mode.

00:38:17.336 --> 00:38:19.716 A:middle
Verify your app never asks you
for the setup screen again.

00:38:20.816 --> 00:38:21.896 A:middle
A very simple test.

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:23.866 A:middle
Install your app, run
through the setup screen,

00:38:23.866 --> 00:38:25.506 A:middle
delete your app,
relaunch your app.

00:38:25.506 --> 00:38:26.496 A:middle
Do you get the setup screen?

00:38:26.656 --> 00:38:27.276 A:middle
Not done yet.

00:38:27.986 --> 00:38:30.736 A:middle
So testing's important.

00:38:30.736 --> 00:38:32.126 A:middle
Moving into the Cloud's
a very big deal.

00:38:32.456 --> 00:38:34.316 A:middle
Once it's there I think
you'll be very satisfied

00:38:34.316 --> 00:38:35.836 A:middle
with the results and
here's some help.

00:38:35.836 --> 00:38:37.746 A:middle
If you want more help
or more assistance,

00:38:37.986 --> 00:38:39.506 A:middle
again there's a lab
right after this.

00:38:39.816 --> 00:38:41.346 A:middle
We'll all be there to
answer questions for you.

00:38:42.556 --> 00:38:46.856 A:middle
This was a plea, we
had a lot of this

00:38:46.856 --> 00:38:48.796 A:middle
from the internal developers.

00:38:50.136 --> 00:38:52.736 A:middle
Log out actually tries
to do an orderly shutdown

00:38:52.996 --> 00:38:53.816 A:middle
of everybody's app.

00:38:54.546 --> 00:38:57.346 A:middle
If you're leaking UI background
tasks, logout can't complete.

00:38:57.626 --> 00:38:59.366 A:middle
And this is upsetting to people.

00:38:59.816 --> 00:39:03.236 A:middle
Liam can't log in until Mia's
logout session is finished.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.816 --> 00:39:03.236 A:middle
Liam can't log in until Mia's
logout session is finished.

00:39:03.236 --> 00:39:05.136 A:middle
If you're leaking
UI background tasks,

00:39:05.426 --> 00:39:07.246 A:middle
your app cannot be terminated.

00:39:07.246 --> 00:39:08.626 A:middle
It will eventually time out.

00:39:08.886 --> 00:39:10.196 A:middle
It will eventually be killed.

00:39:10.336 --> 00:39:11.556 A:middle
But that's not good for anybody.

00:39:11.876 --> 00:39:14.146 A:middle
So make sure you're not
leaking UI background tasks,

00:39:14.146 --> 00:39:15.666 A:middle
because those will block logout.

00:39:20.056 --> 00:39:22.686 A:middle
So, that's the technologies
you need to adopt

00:39:23.636 --> 00:39:25.106 A:middle
and the changes you
need to make.

00:39:25.176 --> 00:39:27.766 A:middle
And all of these changes make
it better for Shared iPad

00:39:27.766 --> 00:39:29.616 A:middle
and business use
case, but they're kind

00:39:29.616 --> 00:39:31.636 A:middle
of the bare minimum changes
you need to be useful

00:39:31.636 --> 00:39:32.456 A:middle
in those environments.

00:39:32.996 --> 00:39:35.726 A:middle
The work that you're
going to do is also useful

00:39:35.726 --> 00:39:37.026 A:middle
for even your consumer use case.

00:39:37.026 --> 00:39:39.576 A:middle
So the good news is is this
sort of investment is not just

00:39:39.576 --> 00:39:42.376 A:middle
for education and business, it's
also for your consumer use case.

00:39:42.576 --> 00:39:44.526 A:middle
And it will become baseline
for your application.

00:39:45.686 --> 00:39:48.036 A:middle
Now there's opportunities to go
beyond the minimum requirements

00:39:48.036 --> 00:39:50.676 A:middle
of putting your data in the
Cloud and you can really,

00:39:50.676 --> 00:39:53.756 A:middle
really have your app be world
class and be a preferred choice

00:39:54.006 --> 00:39:55.356 A:middle
for potential licensers.

00:39:55.596 --> 00:39:58.096 A:middle
Like going beyond just adopting
the Cloud and adopting some

00:39:58.096 --> 00:39:59.466 A:middle
of the newer technologies
this year.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:00.536 --> 00:40:03.226 A:middle
The first and most exciting
technology, how many people were

00:40:03.226 --> 00:40:04.536 A:middle
in the session before
this with Todd?

00:40:05.666 --> 00:40:08.116 A:middle
Oh, good. A good number,
the classroom app,

00:40:08.446 --> 00:40:09.526 A:middle
one of the most exciting apps.

00:40:09.526 --> 00:40:12.466 A:middle
It's kind of silly but it's
really kind of cool to be God

00:40:12.466 --> 00:40:13.646 A:middle
and sit up there with
the Classroom app

00:40:13.646 --> 00:40:16.686 A:middle
and control an entire lab
form an iPad is really,

00:40:16.686 --> 00:40:18.916 A:middle
really kind of very powerful.

00:40:19.856 --> 00:40:21.476 A:middle
And one of the key technologies

00:40:21.476 --> 00:40:24.786 A:middle
that Classroom app
leverages is Universal Links.

00:40:25.846 --> 00:40:28.106 A:middle
Universal Links is
not new with iOS 9.3,

00:40:28.106 --> 00:40:29.346 A:middle
it was introduced with iOS 9.

00:40:30.036 --> 00:40:33.406 A:middle
And it provides a
feature that allows you

00:40:33.406 --> 00:40:37.306 A:middle
to share external links back to
your application off the device.

00:40:37.376 --> 00:40:38.686 A:middle
It also enables sharing

00:40:39.266 --> 00:40:42.756 A:middle
and searching inside
your app on the device.

00:40:42.756 --> 00:40:44.306 A:middle
It's a huge advantage for
you to adopt Universal Links.

00:40:44.656 --> 00:40:48.116 A:middle
What's new this year is we've
built on Universal Links

00:40:48.116 --> 00:40:50.826 A:middle
as a basic understanding that
a lot of apps support this.

00:40:51.636 --> 00:40:53.746 A:middle
And universal links is
one of the key features

00:40:53.966 --> 00:40:57.926 A:middle
that Classroom leverages
to guide your app,

00:40:57.926 --> 00:41:00.296 A:middle
or control your app while
in a classroom situation.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:57.926 --> 00:41:00.296 A:middle
or control your app while
in a classroom situation.

00:41:00.296 --> 00:41:02.066 A:middle
So if your app supports
Universal Links,

00:41:02.586 --> 00:41:05.736 A:middle
a teacher anywhere in the world
can decide your app is the

00:41:05.736 --> 00:41:08.146 A:middle
coolest app in the world, and
she can integrate your app

00:41:08.146 --> 00:41:09.416 A:middle
into her course curriculum.

00:41:09.646 --> 00:41:11.626 A:middle
And she will then use that
with the Classroom app

00:41:11.626 --> 00:41:13.296 A:middle
to use your app during
the session.

00:41:13.296 --> 00:41:16.206 A:middle
This will make your app world
class and the most desirable app

00:41:16.206 --> 00:41:18.056 A:middle
in the App Store for
the school to license.

00:41:18.896 --> 00:41:21.796 A:middle
If you can't use Universal
Links, it will make it harder

00:41:21.866 --> 00:41:24.226 A:middle
for a teachers to integrate
your app into their curriculum

00:41:24.406 --> 00:41:26.256 A:middle
and harder for them to use
it with the Classroom app.

00:41:26.626 --> 00:41:29.286 A:middle
And therefore this is an
opportunity for you to surprise

00:41:29.286 --> 00:41:31.616 A:middle
and delight your customers

00:41:31.616 --> 00:41:32.996 A:middle
in that your app
will work really well

00:41:32.996 --> 00:41:33.956 A:middle
in a classroom situation.

00:41:33.956 --> 00:41:36.866 A:middle
But the key to this
is Universal Links.

00:41:36.866 --> 00:41:39.126 A:middle
And just like the Cloud stuff
this is beneficial for your app

00:41:39.126 --> 00:41:41.116 A:middle
in or out of a shared
use case environment,

00:41:41.406 --> 00:41:43.786 A:middle
but this is more
evidence that we're piling

00:41:43.786 --> 00:41:46.386 A:middle
on these core technologies
to make your app

00:41:46.386 --> 00:41:50.036 A:middle
as useful as possible.

00:41:50.626 --> 00:41:53.266 A:middle
Another new feature
with iOS 9.3.2,

00:41:53.266 --> 00:41:56.056 A:middle
some app developers do automatic
assessment apps, these are apps

00:41:56.056 --> 00:41:59.606 A:middle
that do standardized testing
or assessment of a student.

00:41:59.606 --> 00:42:01.286 A:middle
They put it in full screen
mode, they lock it down.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:59.606 --> 00:42:01.286 A:middle
They put it in full screen
mode, they lock it down.

00:42:01.736 --> 00:42:04.166 A:middle
We've made some changes to
make this more accessible.

00:42:04.166 --> 00:42:05.946 A:middle
The biggest change
is you can now be

00:42:05.946 --> 00:42:07.126 A:middle
in automatic assessment app

00:42:07.126 --> 00:42:08.646 A:middle
without being on
a supervised iPad.

00:42:08.766 --> 00:42:11.536 A:middle
You get an entitlement for
this, you can request it.

00:42:11.866 --> 00:42:14.936 A:middle
And in particular you
can now call an API

00:42:15.536 --> 00:42:17.346 A:middle
to request different
keyboard features.

00:42:17.346 --> 00:42:19.706 A:middle
Like you may not want a spelling
app allowing auto correction

00:42:19.706 --> 00:42:21.066 A:middle
happening while the
student is being assessed

00:42:21.066 --> 00:42:22.226 A:middle
for their spelling test.

00:42:22.226 --> 00:42:23.666 A:middle
So apps can now drive this.

00:42:23.906 --> 00:42:25.626 A:middle
They can request an
entitlement for this

00:42:26.396 --> 00:42:28.856 A:middle
and more importantly
it's no longer restricted

00:42:28.856 --> 00:42:32.376 A:middle
to just shared, or supervised
iPads it can run on any iPad.

00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:34.566 A:middle
And so if you're an
assessment-based application

00:42:34.566 --> 00:42:36.706 A:middle
or were considering being an
assessment-based application,

00:42:36.706 --> 00:42:39.106 A:middle
iOS 9.3.2 has opened up
more opportunities for you.

00:42:39.466 --> 00:42:41.486 A:middle
Again come to the lab, we
can give you more details.

00:42:41.766 --> 00:42:45.006 A:middle
But that's part of iOS 9.3.2.

00:42:46.696 --> 00:42:48.246 A:middle
Managed App Configuration.

00:42:49.036 --> 00:42:51.736 A:middle
This was introduced with iOS 7

00:42:52.516 --> 00:42:54.786 A:middle
and basically what this
does is allows administrator

00:42:54.786 --> 00:42:58.106 A:middle
to blast initial app settings
out to thousands, or hundreds,

00:42:58.596 --> 00:43:01.156 A:middle
or tens of thousands of iPads
so that every app starts


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:58.596 --> 00:43:01.156 A:middle
or tens of thousands of iPads
so that every app starts

00:43:01.156 --> 00:43:02.536 A:middle
in an initial configuration.

00:43:02.966 --> 00:43:04.486 A:middle
It's really simple to adopt.

00:43:05.096 --> 00:43:07.406 A:middle
There's just an additional
key in your NSUser defaults.

00:43:07.406 --> 00:43:09.256 A:middle
If you see that key,
the key points

00:43:09.256 --> 00:43:10.836 A:middle
to an app specific
dictionary that you,

00:43:10.836 --> 00:43:11.936 A:middle
as the developer, control.

00:43:12.266 --> 00:43:14.496 A:middle
And the administrator who set

00:43:14.496 --> 00:43:16.776 A:middle
up those things will provide the
default dictionary for your app.

00:43:18.216 --> 00:43:19.956 A:middle
The problem was is
there was different ways

00:43:19.956 --> 00:43:22.526 A:middle
that MDM vendors chose
to send this information,

00:43:22.526 --> 00:43:24.506 A:middle
configuration this information
on how to package it.

00:43:24.626 --> 00:43:27.986 A:middle
So new for this year is there's
a community, not affiliated

00:43:27.986 --> 00:43:29.416 A:middle
with Apple, but we're
a participant,

00:43:29.956 --> 00:43:31.396 A:middle
where all the various MDM,

00:43:31.576 --> 00:43:34.496 A:middle
Mobile Device Management server
vendors are standardizing

00:43:34.496 --> 00:43:36.146 A:middle
the payloads.

00:43:36.606 --> 00:43:38.266 A:middle
The standardization
efforts documented

00:43:38.266 --> 00:43:39.776 A:middle
at the URL you see
here on the website.

00:43:40.256 --> 00:43:44.136 A:middle
The biggest advantage is you
can now have a single app

00:43:44.686 --> 00:43:46.336 A:middle
that supports multiple
MDM vendors.

00:43:46.336 --> 00:43:48.886 A:middle
And as I was researching
this presentation and I'm new

00:43:49.236 --> 00:43:51.856 A:middle
to the device management realm
within the past 18 months.

00:43:51.856 --> 00:43:53.676 A:middle
I was surprised to find
out that this was the case.

00:43:54.006 --> 00:43:56.906 A:middle
So right now there's an app
in the App Store, today,

00:43:56.906 --> 00:44:00.166 A:middle
we're not making this up,
that has this many SKU's.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:56.906 --> 00:44:00.166 A:middle
we're not making this up,
that has this many SKU's.

00:44:00.216 --> 00:44:02.726 A:middle
Now what I can tell you is
they're not using auto layout

00:44:02.726 --> 00:44:04.016 A:middle
so that's why they
have a different screen

00:44:04.016 --> 00:44:05.156 A:middle
on iPhone and an iPad app.

00:44:05.566 --> 00:44:07.596 A:middle
But the six that you
see, and you see each one

00:44:07.596 --> 00:44:10.806 A:middle
of these six icons represents
a different MDM server

00:44:11.696 --> 00:44:12.726 A:middle
that they have to support.

00:44:14.036 --> 00:44:15.846 A:middle
So, as you can imagine
this is a bit

00:44:15.846 --> 00:44:17.196 A:middle
of a nightmare for
them to maintain.

00:44:17.196 --> 00:44:19.946 A:middle
So by moving onto the new app,

00:44:19.946 --> 00:44:23.436 A:middle
the managed application
consortium, they should be able

00:44:23.436 --> 00:44:26.436 A:middle
to turn their apps
from this into this.

00:44:26.796 --> 00:44:28.286 A:middle
They can have one
version for the phone

00:44:28.286 --> 00:44:29.666 A:middle
that supports all
the MDM vendors

00:44:29.666 --> 00:44:31.276 A:middle
and they can have one
version for the iPad

00:44:31.936 --> 00:44:32.786 A:middle
that supports all the MDMs.

00:44:32.786 --> 00:44:34.166 A:middle
So that would be a
huge advantage alone.

00:44:34.756 --> 00:44:36.556 A:middle
If they move onto Auto
Layout and use all

00:44:36.556 --> 00:44:38.876 A:middle
of Apple's latest technologies,
they should be able to do this.

00:44:39.816 --> 00:44:42.116 A:middle
That would be one
SKU in the App Store

00:44:42.276 --> 00:44:44.166 A:middle
that supports all the
different screen sizes

00:44:44.436 --> 00:44:48.426 A:middle
and also can be managed from all
of the major MDM server vendors.

00:44:48.496 --> 00:44:50.436 A:middle
So if you're going to
go into this market

00:44:50.436 --> 00:44:51.856 A:middle
and you want your
app to be managed

00:44:52.366 --> 00:44:56.086 A:middle
through application management,
look into the new consortium,

00:44:56.296 --> 00:44:59.256 A:middle
work with them and learn
to adopt what they've got.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:01.146 --> 00:45:06.856 A:middle
So, in conclusion, along with
Shared iPad, I hope to leave you

00:45:06.856 --> 00:45:09.276 A:middle
with a message that regards
to what market you're selling

00:45:09.276 --> 00:45:13.306 A:middle
into the iOS ecosystem is rich,
it's vibrant, it's profitable,

00:45:13.776 --> 00:45:14.846 A:middle
it's open to everybody.

00:45:15.556 --> 00:45:19.556 A:middle
But it's also very demanding
in that customers expect a lot.

00:45:19.716 --> 00:45:21.856 A:middle
They expect Auto Layout,
they expect the flexibility,

00:45:21.856 --> 00:45:23.086 A:middle
they expect you to be on Swift,

00:45:23.086 --> 00:45:24.836 A:middle
they want AirPlay,
they want 3D touch.

00:45:25.096 --> 00:45:27.506 A:middle
And this year, new right
over here, SiriKit.

00:45:28.466 --> 00:45:30.306 A:middle
So that's another technology.

00:45:30.356 --> 00:45:32.756 A:middle
What can your app do with Siri
that could be revolutionary

00:45:32.756 --> 00:45:34.366 A:middle
in an educational
business environment

00:45:34.366 --> 00:45:35.396 A:middle
for you to adopt SiriKit?

00:45:35.476 --> 00:45:37.026 A:middle
So keep your app fresh.

00:45:37.026 --> 00:45:37.976 A:middle
Keep your app vibrant.

00:45:38.236 --> 00:45:39.686 A:middle
Adopt the cloud technologies.

00:45:39.686 --> 00:45:41.476 A:middle
And what you're doing is
making your app better

00:45:41.476 --> 00:45:43.646 A:middle
for your consumers and
better for business use

00:45:43.646 --> 00:45:46.326 A:middle
and institutional use, and
in particular, education.

00:45:46.546 --> 00:45:49.146 A:middle
So, I appreciate your time.

00:45:49.686 --> 00:45:50.996 A:middle
I've really enjoyed
speaking to you.

00:45:50.996 --> 00:45:52.296 A:middle
I'll be happy to
answer questions

00:45:52.296 --> 00:45:53.636 A:middle
in the lab later
if you have any.

00:45:53.636 --> 00:45:56.386 A:middle
I have co-workers there and
I have some guidance for you.

00:45:56.386 --> 00:45:58.406 A:middle
So there will be
links, any links found

00:45:58.406 --> 00:45:59.596 A:middle
in this session will
be at this link.

00:46:00.146 --> 00:46:03.526 A:middle
And here's a little roadmap of
either stuff to review on video

00:46:03.526 --> 00:46:05.296 A:middle
if you've already missed it,
or stuff that's upcoming.

00:46:05.296 --> 00:46:07.386 A:middle
So we've got What's New in Apple
Device Management, you're going

00:46:07.386 --> 00:46:09.486 A:middle
to have to review that on
video if you didn't see it.

00:46:09.976 --> 00:46:12.316 A:middle
Improving Existing Apps
with Modern Best Practices.

00:46:12.616 --> 00:46:15.136 A:middle
This is at 3 p.m. immediately
following this session.

00:46:15.136 --> 00:46:16.836 A:middle
So this will be a
more in-depth view

00:46:16.836 --> 00:46:19.306 A:middle
of the best modern
implementation techniques

00:46:19.306 --> 00:46:19.706 A:middle
for apps.

00:46:20.156 --> 00:46:23.146 A:middle
Optimizing the use of On-Demand
Resources is happening Thursday.

00:46:23.766 --> 00:46:26.256 A:middle
Extending your App with SiriKit
is happening on Thursday.

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:27.956 A:middle
What's New in CloudKit,
Thursday.

00:46:28.276 --> 00:46:29.386 A:middle
CloudKit Best Practices.

00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:30.276 A:middle
If you're going to move your app

00:46:30.276 --> 00:46:31.646 A:middle
into the Cloud these are
the engineers that are going

00:46:31.646 --> 00:46:33.376 A:middle
to tell you in gory
detail how to do it.

00:46:34.586 --> 00:46:37.626 A:middle
Again, thank you for your time,
and I appreciate you attending.
