[ Applause ]

00:00:31.896 --> 00:00:32.506 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:37.576 A:middle
We're going to be moving the
attendee bash to my house

00:00:37.576 --> 00:00:40.936 A:middle
over in Berkley, it's a
lot more fun over there.

00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:47.776 A:middle
So welcome to Session
717, Beyond Dictation,

00:00:48.326 --> 00:00:51.706 A:middle
Enhanced Voice-Control for
macOS and Applications.

00:00:51.846 --> 00:00:54.506 A:middle
I'm Sal Saghoian, I'm
the Product Manager

00:00:54.506 --> 00:00:56.996 A:middle
for Automation Technologies
at Apple.

00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:01.386 A:middle
Today we're going to be
talking about the Mac,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:01.386 A:middle
Today we're going to be
talking about the Mac,

00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:09.176 A:middle
macOS and what happens when you
combine the speech recognition

00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:15.806 A:middle
architecture in the macOS with
the native automation frameworks

00:01:15.806 --> 00:01:17.246 A:middle
that are available to you

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:20.316 A:middle
to produce some really
incredible results.

00:01:21.256 --> 00:01:23.986 A:middle
Now when you're talking
about speech recognition

00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:28.066 A:middle
and dictation it's grouped
into four different categories.

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:33.296 A:middle
The first dictation is
basically about transcription,

00:01:33.786 --> 00:01:37.096 A:middle
about you speaking something
that getting transcribed and put

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.816 A:middle
into the current text field.

00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:47.246 A:middle
Enhanced dictation advances that
ability by adding the ability

00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:51.406 A:middle
to edit the text and to
navigate within a text field.

00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:56.596 A:middle
Advanced commands
include the ability

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.516 A:middle
to control an application's
interface,

00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:02.736 A:middle
as well as perform
dictation tasks as well.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:02.736 A:middle
as well as perform
dictation tasks as well.

00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:06.716 A:middle
You can click buttons, tabs,
menus, those kinds of things.

00:02:07.546 --> 00:02:11.986 A:middle
And finally, user commands are
custom dictation commands you

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:14.836 A:middle
create yourself to
perform the kind of things

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:18.136 A:middle
that aren't a part of the
standard library of commands

00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:19.556 A:middle
that come with the computer.

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:24.286 A:middle
So in macOS in the
latest version a lot

00:02:24.286 --> 00:02:26.726 A:middle
of things got moved
around, so what I'm going

00:02:26.726 --> 00:02:30.616 A:middle
to do is take a very short
couple minutes and review

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:34.086 A:middle
where all these different
technologies live,

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:37.006 A:middle
how to turn them on
and then we're going

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:37.976 A:middle
to have some real fun.

00:02:38.996 --> 00:02:43.416 A:middle
So begin with we'll take
a look at basic dictation.

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:50.306 A:middle
Now if you open up the System
Preferences app the controls

00:02:50.306 --> 00:02:53.836 A:middle
for speech and dictation
used to be in this window,

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:58.636 A:middle
but instead of where they
were there is now the

00:02:58.636 --> 00:02:59.696 A:middle
Siri preference.

00:02:59.696 --> 00:03:02.146 A:middle
And if we open the Siri
preference you'll see


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.696 --> 00:03:02.146 A:middle
And if we open the Siri
preference you'll see

00:03:02.146 --> 00:03:05.286 A:middle
that there are no controls in
there for dictation and speech.

00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:10.196 A:middle
It's important to understand
that Siri and dictation

00:03:10.196 --> 00:03:13.106 A:middle
and speech are two
different technologies.

00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:16.146 A:middle
They have different
functions, different uses,

00:03:16.146 --> 00:03:17.466 A:middle
and different purposes.

00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:20.306 A:middle
So if we close this
and we go back

00:03:20.306 --> 00:03:24.156 A:middle
out to the main preference
window and we search

00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:26.306 A:middle
for the word dictation
in the search field

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:28.786 A:middle
at the top right you'll see

00:03:28.786 --> 00:03:33.006 A:middle
that interestingly the keyboard
preference is now selected.

00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:39.566 A:middle
And if we open that you'll see a
new button added to the Tab bar

00:03:39.566 --> 00:03:42.476 A:middle
of that window at the end
and it's for dictation.

00:03:42.566 --> 00:03:46.766 A:middle
If we select that there are
the dictation controls now

00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:50.826 A:middle
in macOS are now within the
Keyboard System Preference pane.

00:03:51.516 --> 00:03:54.136 A:middle
There's a couple of radio
buttons there initially

00:03:54.136 --> 00:03:55.606 A:middle
for turning it off and on.

00:03:55.606 --> 00:03:58.956 A:middle
And when you turn on
dictation, basic dictation,

00:03:59.396 --> 00:04:02.786 A:middle
you'll see this sheet drop
down and it has two bits


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:59.396 --> 00:04:02.786 A:middle
you'll see this sheet drop
down and it has two bits

00:04:02.786 --> 00:04:04.976 A:middle
of information that are
important to understand.

00:04:05.786 --> 00:04:13.206 A:middle
The first is that what you say
gets recorded by the computer

00:04:13.206 --> 00:04:16.505 A:middle
and sent to Apple servers
so that it's transcribed

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:20.166 A:middle
and that text is then sent
back to your computer.

00:04:20.856 --> 00:04:26.366 A:middle
In addition, for accuracy they
send up the names and addresses

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:31.526 A:middle
from your contacts list so
that they can better match some

00:04:31.526 --> 00:04:33.016 A:middle
of the phrases that
you're saying.

00:04:33.926 --> 00:04:35.976 A:middle
If those terms are
okay with you,

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:38.656 A:middle
then you just click the
Enable Dictation button

00:04:39.256 --> 00:04:41.566 A:middle
and now dictation is on.

00:04:41.786 --> 00:04:45.196 A:middle
And you can dictate
into any text field

00:04:45.196 --> 00:04:50.056 A:middle
like a TextEdit document,
into a messages window,

00:04:50.616 --> 00:04:54.626 A:middle
into a mail message, and even

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:58.356 A:middle
into a URL input
field for Safari.

00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:02.056 A:middle
You can use dictation
anywhere on the computer


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:02.056 A:middle
You can use dictation
anywhere on the computer

00:05:02.056 --> 00:05:03.366 A:middle
where you have a text field.

00:05:03.816 --> 00:05:07.566 A:middle
And it's good for doing short
things, names, addresses,

00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:10.106 A:middle
some short phrases, it's
really good for that.

00:05:10.626 --> 00:05:12.326 A:middle
But it does have
some limitations

00:05:12.326 --> 00:05:15.206 A:middle
in that you do need an
active Internet connection

00:05:15.206 --> 00:05:16.686 A:middle
to connect to the servers.

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:21.606 A:middle
And it's also not intended
for use with long dictations

00:05:21.606 --> 00:05:26.056 A:middle
like if you're doing a business
letter, it's not really designed

00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:27.736 A:middle
for that kind of thing.

00:05:28.026 --> 00:05:30.916 A:middle
You'll have to keep activating
the dictation command all the

00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:34.206 A:middle
time and there really are no
editing controls for dealing

00:05:34.206 --> 00:05:35.796 A:middle
with mistakes or
changes you want

00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:37.486 A:middle
to make to the dictated text.

00:05:38.696 --> 00:05:41.626 A:middle
Which brings us to
the next category,

00:05:41.856 --> 00:05:43.416 A:middle
which is enhanced dictation.

00:05:43.806 --> 00:05:46.346 A:middle
Not only can you
dictate into text fields,

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:48.946 A:middle
but you could navigate between
the different text fields

00:05:48.946 --> 00:05:52.926 A:middle
of a window and edit the text
that you have there as well.

00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:55.216 A:middle
That was a pretty nice
little animation there,

00:05:55.216 --> 00:05:55.816 A:middle
did you like that?

00:05:56.226 --> 00:05:59.256 A:middle
So if we go back to our
Preferences window here,

00:05:59.686 --> 00:06:02.416 A:middle
below the On Off button
that we just turned off


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.686 --> 00:06:02.416 A:middle
below the On Off button
that we just turned off

00:06:02.416 --> 00:06:06.186 A:middle
and on is a checkbox called
Use Enhanced Dictation.

00:06:06.886 --> 00:06:09.696 A:middle
And when you select this
three things happen.

00:06:10.356 --> 00:06:14.476 A:middle
The first is it allows your
computer to be used offline.

00:06:15.216 --> 00:06:18.676 A:middle
You no longer have to --
require an Internet connection

00:06:18.676 --> 00:06:19.916 A:middle
to Apple servers.

00:06:20.206 --> 00:06:24.876 A:middle
All the transcription is done
locally on your computer.

00:06:25.926 --> 00:06:28.676 A:middle
In addition, you can
dictate continuously.

00:06:28.676 --> 00:06:31.176 A:middle
So you can sit there
over a 20 minute period

00:06:31.176 --> 00:06:34.996 A:middle
to dictate a letter and work
continuously with the computer

00:06:35.336 --> 00:06:37.356 A:middle
so that it will actually
grab what you say

00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:38.596 A:middle
and type it in for you.

00:06:39.256 --> 00:06:42.796 A:middle
And the third thing is that
the computer can now give you

00:06:42.796 --> 00:06:44.016 A:middle
live feedback.

00:06:44.526 --> 00:06:48.276 A:middle
It can give you an audio
sound or a visual cue

00:06:48.276 --> 00:06:51.036 A:middle
that it has heard you, that it
has recognized what you have

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:51.546 A:middle
to say.

00:06:52.766 --> 00:06:57.526 A:middle
So we're going to turn
that on and then go back

00:06:57.526 --> 00:06:59.296 A:middle
out to the main Preferences
window.

00:06:59.946 --> 00:07:04.416 A:middle
Now to see what kind of commands
are available to us we're going


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:59.946 --> 00:07:04.416 A:middle
Now to see what kind of commands
are available to us we're going

00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:07.456 A:middle
to go to the Accessibility
System Preference pane

00:07:07.966 --> 00:07:10.596 A:middle
and scroll down that
list on the left

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:12.636 A:middle
and select the thing
that says Dictation.

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:17.616 A:middle
Your preferences for using
dictation on the computer

00:07:18.056 --> 00:07:20.866 A:middle
in an enhanced mode are now
displayed here on the right.

00:07:21.476 --> 00:07:24.936 A:middle
You have an option to mute the
audio when you're dictating.

00:07:24.936 --> 00:07:26.266 A:middle
So if you have iTunes playing

00:07:26.266 --> 00:07:28.946 A:middle
and you started dictation
it automatically mutes it.

00:07:29.556 --> 00:07:32.726 A:middle
You can have it play
a confirmation sound,

00:07:32.726 --> 00:07:35.206 A:middle
which is usually like a
little [swish sound] just

00:07:35.206 --> 00:07:37.486 A:middle
to let you know that
it heard you.

00:07:37.836 --> 00:07:41.406 A:middle
You'll hear this being used when
I do some demos here for you.

00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:44.886 A:middle
And you can also
assign a key word

00:07:44.886 --> 00:07:47.876 A:middle
so that the computer will
not react to what you say

00:07:48.086 --> 00:07:50.736 A:middle
until it hears that
key word first

00:07:51.036 --> 00:07:53.576 A:middle
like computer what time is it.

00:07:54.586 --> 00:07:57.296 A:middle
So to see the commands that
you've now enabled we're going

00:07:57.296 --> 00:08:01.066 A:middle
to click the Dictation Commands
button and we get this sheet


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:57.296 --> 00:08:01.066 A:middle
to click the Dictation Commands
button and we get this sheet

00:08:01.066 --> 00:08:03.476 A:middle
that comes down and it
lists all the commands.

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:06.626 A:middle
Commands are grouped into suites

00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:09.726 A:middle
and suites contain
one or more commands.

00:08:10.906 --> 00:08:14.266 A:middle
You can search through all the
available commands using the

00:08:14.266 --> 00:08:16.156 A:middle
search field at the top.

00:08:16.376 --> 00:08:19.816 A:middle
And when you have a command
selected you can turn it off

00:08:19.816 --> 00:08:22.956 A:middle
or on by selecting that
checkbox to the left of it.

00:08:23.566 --> 00:08:28.076 A:middle
And you can also see the
syntactical options available

00:08:28.076 --> 00:08:30.306 A:middle
to you on the right-hand side.

00:08:30.306 --> 00:08:34.416 A:middle
A lot of commands can be spoken
a variety of different ways

00:08:34.416 --> 00:08:37.006 A:middle
and all of those different
ways will trigger the command

00:08:37.006 --> 00:08:37.765 A:middle
to execute.

00:08:39.476 --> 00:08:40.986 A:middle
So let's look at the first suite

00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:42.586 A:middle
of commands, the
Selection Suite.

00:08:43.006 --> 00:08:45.606 A:middle
This suite is designed
to select text.

00:08:45.606 --> 00:08:49.146 A:middle
So you can select a word,
a paragraph, a sentence

00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:51.416 A:middle
and you'll notice that
there is even a command

00:08:51.416 --> 00:08:52.796 A:middle
for selecting a phrase.

00:08:54.196 --> 00:08:57.486 A:middle
The Navigation Suite
is for navigating

00:08:57.486 --> 00:08:59.836 A:middle
within your editing area.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:00.546 --> 00:09:03.136 A:middle
So you can go to the end, go
to the beginning, go to the end

00:09:03.136 --> 00:09:04.646 A:middle
of the sentence that
kind of thing.

00:09:04.866 --> 00:09:08.236 A:middle
You can scroll up, scroll
down, move left, move right.

00:09:08.786 --> 00:09:12.026 A:middle
So it's really designed to
help you move around a window

00:09:12.026 --> 00:09:16.456 A:middle
between different fields and
scrolling the view plane.

00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:20.916 A:middle
There is a short editing suite
that contains the ability

00:09:20.916 --> 00:09:24.326 A:middle
to cut, copy, paste, as well
as perform some transformations

00:09:24.326 --> 00:09:27.436 A:middle
like capitalize,
lowercase, uppercase,

00:09:27.436 --> 00:09:28.596 A:middle
those kinds of things.

00:09:29.426 --> 00:09:32.646 A:middle
And you'll notice that there
is one special command there

00:09:32.646 --> 00:09:33.876 A:middle
called Replace.

00:09:34.186 --> 00:09:36.796 A:middle
So you can say replace
this phrase

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:39.476 A:middle
with this phrase,
that's quite handy.

00:09:40.466 --> 00:09:43.796 A:middle
There's a small formatting suite
for doing things like bold,

00:09:43.876 --> 00:09:47.976 A:middle
italicized underline and
there is a small system suite

00:09:47.976 --> 00:09:52.936 A:middle
for stopping dictation and for
also displaying a floating HUD

00:09:53.376 --> 00:09:55.246 A:middle
that lists all of the commands.

00:09:55.246 --> 00:09:57.606 A:middle
So if you're in the
middle of a dictation

00:09:57.606 --> 00:09:59.646 A:middle
and you're not sure what
command is available,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:00.006 --> 00:10:02.976 A:middle
you can say show Commands and
this little HUD will appear.

00:10:04.196 --> 00:10:07.586 A:middle
So together these make a
pretty comprehensive set

00:10:07.586 --> 00:10:10.846 A:middle
for doing some basic
good editing

00:10:10.886 --> 00:10:12.126 A:middle
of what you're dictating.

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:15.336 A:middle
And to show you I
recorded a little video

00:10:15.336 --> 00:10:17.226 A:middle
of me doing it in pages.

00:10:17.486 --> 00:10:21.296 A:middle
So I just said something
it gets transcribed.

00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:24.656 A:middle
Replace Brazil with America.

00:10:26.206 --> 00:10:41.236 A:middle
Select power, capitalize that,
go to end, new line, new line,

00:10:43.336 --> 00:10:48.056 A:middle
the future of wind
power is amazing period.

00:10:48.946 --> 00:10:53.676 A:middle
So I dictated to the computer,
it transcribed what I said.

00:10:53.676 --> 00:10:57.906 A:middle
I said select -- wait
until you see me live.

00:10:59.406 --> 00:11:02.366 A:middle
So then I used the Replace
command, I selected Brazil,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.406 --> 00:11:02.366 A:middle
So then I used the Replace
command, I selected Brazil,

00:11:02.366 --> 00:11:03.526 A:middle
changed it to America,

00:11:03.526 --> 00:11:06.366 A:middle
I capitalized something,
I navigated around.

00:11:06.456 --> 00:11:10.096 A:middle
So you get the idea that, you
know, this is very powerful.

00:11:10.666 --> 00:11:13.516 A:middle
Enhanced dictation
gives you many things.

00:11:13.516 --> 00:11:17.116 A:middle
It allows you to work
continuously offline

00:11:17.116 --> 00:11:21.276 A:middle
on your computer with no
interaction necessary.

00:11:21.276 --> 00:11:23.126 A:middle
It's giving you live feedback,

00:11:24.066 --> 00:11:26.016 A:middle
but it does have
some limitations

00:11:26.306 --> 00:11:28.256 A:middle
and I call it it's procedural.

00:11:28.746 --> 00:11:31.136 A:middle
It means that it's
like describing how

00:11:31.136 --> 00:11:33.026 A:middle
to make a peanut
butter sandwich.

00:11:33.386 --> 00:11:36.646 A:middle
You hold the jar with this
hand, you turn the top this way.

00:11:36.816 --> 00:11:39.146 A:middle
So you have to guide
the computer

00:11:39.516 --> 00:11:41.726 A:middle
through the process
of what you're doing.

00:11:42.206 --> 00:11:45.976 A:middle
You have to tell it to move to
the end, new line, new line.

00:11:46.426 --> 00:11:49.566 A:middle
And that can take some
getting used to in order

00:11:49.566 --> 00:11:50.986 A:middle
to be able to do that smoothly.

00:11:52.676 --> 00:11:57.756 A:middle
The next category of recognition
is advanced commands and that's

00:11:57.756 --> 00:12:01.076 A:middle
where you augment the dictation
abilities with the ability


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:57.756 --> 00:12:01.076 A:middle
where you augment the dictation
abilities with the ability

00:12:01.076 --> 00:12:03.516 A:middle
to control the application
interface.

00:12:04.416 --> 00:12:07.556 A:middle
So not only are you
being able to dictate,

00:12:07.556 --> 00:12:08.986 A:middle
but you can push buttons.

00:12:09.586 --> 00:12:12.196 A:middle
So if we go back to
this accessibility sheet

00:12:12.196 --> 00:12:13.996 A:middle
that we were looking at down

00:12:13.996 --> 00:12:19.906 A:middle
at the bottom is a checkbox
called Enable Advanced Commands.

00:12:20.736 --> 00:12:26.466 A:middle
And if you select that it turns
on new suites and expands some

00:12:26.466 --> 00:12:28.526 A:middle
of the suites of commands
that are available.

00:12:29.216 --> 00:12:33.896 A:middle
So the Navigation Suite now
expands to include things

00:12:33.896 --> 00:12:36.566 A:middle
for controlling the
application interface.

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:40.456 A:middle
You can say show numbers
and a number will be placed

00:12:40.456 --> 00:12:42.766 A:middle
over every control
in the application

00:12:42.956 --> 00:12:45.666 A:middle
and then you can just speak
the number and that button

00:12:45.736 --> 00:12:48.656 A:middle
or menu will be pressed
and activated.

00:12:49.596 --> 00:12:54.166 A:middle
The System Suite is now
expanded to include the ability

00:12:54.396 --> 00:12:58.716 A:middle
to search spotlight and
that is really useful.

00:12:59.296 --> 00:13:00.766 A:middle
You can also show commands


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.296 --> 00:13:00.766 A:middle
You can also show commands

00:13:00.766 --> 00:13:03.106 A:middle
and hide commands just
the same way as before.

00:13:03.806 --> 00:13:07.686 A:middle
There is now an Application
Suite for switching

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:10.976 A:middle
between applications, for
quitting an application,

00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:13.216 A:middle
and hiding an application.

00:13:13.486 --> 00:13:17.236 A:middle
And there's a small Document
Suite that lets you open,

00:13:17.276 --> 00:13:22.056 A:middle
create, save, close documents
within an application.

00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:27.236 A:middle
So in addition to this existing
set of commands that we have,

00:13:27.836 --> 00:13:32.236 A:middle
the new set augments
that and expands some

00:13:32.236 --> 00:13:33.396 A:middle
of the key things there.

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:36.926 A:middle
So let me show you how
that works when you use it.

00:13:37.076 --> 00:13:38.786 A:middle
And in this case
I'm going to use it

00:13:38.786 --> 00:13:40.426 A:middle
to create a document in Keynote.

00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:46.376 A:middle
So switch to Keynote and Keynote
will come forward, Show Commands

00:13:47.346 --> 00:13:50.046 A:middle
and you'll get that
floating HUD that has a list

00:13:50.046 --> 00:13:51.766 A:middle
of all the commands
that are available.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.546 A:middle
And if we look at the
document section there,

00:13:54.546 --> 00:13:56.016 A:middle
there's a command for new item.

00:13:56.456 --> 00:14:00.816 A:middle
And this is same thing as going
Command End on the keyboard


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:56.456 --> 00:14:00.816 A:middle
And this is same thing as going
Command End on the keyboard

00:14:01.036 --> 00:14:03.576 A:middle
or selecting New
from the File menu.

00:14:04.256 --> 00:14:09.176 A:middle
So I'll say New Item, it
recognizes and since we're

00:14:09.176 --> 00:14:11.566 A:middle
in Keynote it brings
up the Template Picker

00:14:11.566 --> 00:14:14.256 A:middle
so I can pick what kind of
presentation I want to make.

00:14:15.076 --> 00:14:17.726 A:middle
I'm looking to make
a wide presentation

00:14:17.916 --> 00:14:21.486 A:middle
and at the top is a
button that I would click

00:14:21.966 --> 00:14:23.566 A:middle
if I was doing this by hand

00:14:23.886 --> 00:14:26.376 A:middle
to see the wide presentation
templates.

00:14:26.726 --> 00:14:30.006 A:middle
So I'll click Wide and that
will press the button for me

00:14:30.006 --> 00:14:32.456 A:middle
and reveal all the
wide presentations.

00:14:33.016 --> 00:14:34.836 A:middle
Now I'm looking for parchment,

00:14:34.836 --> 00:14:37.006 A:middle
so it doesn't appear
in this view.

00:14:37.216 --> 00:14:40.746 A:middle
So I'll have it scroll the
window by saying Scroll Down

00:14:41.316 --> 00:14:43.826 A:middle
and then there's
parchment at the very end.

00:14:44.136 --> 00:14:47.306 A:middle
And I can select that by
saying Click Parchment.

00:14:48.286 --> 00:14:53.166 A:middle
And once I do it will open
up a new Keynote document

00:14:53.216 --> 00:14:56.196 A:middle
with the parchment theme.

00:14:57.256 --> 00:15:02.766 A:middle
So you can see that advanced
commands augment dictation


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:57.256 --> 00:15:02.766 A:middle
So you can see that advanced
commands augment dictation

00:15:03.046 --> 00:15:06.216 A:middle
by giving you control of
the application interface.

00:15:06.366 --> 00:15:08.576 A:middle
All the buttons and
tabs are available.

00:15:08.966 --> 00:15:12.516 A:middle
But again, like the
other categories

00:15:12.516 --> 00:15:15.366 A:middle
of speech recognition
there are some limitations

00:15:15.366 --> 00:15:17.066 A:middle
and it too is procedural.

00:15:17.346 --> 00:15:19.446 A:middle
You notice I had to
walk through each step

00:15:19.596 --> 00:15:24.356 A:middle
of doing the things required
to create a Keynote document.

00:15:24.546 --> 00:15:28.276 A:middle
I'm basically using my voice
as a mouse or a keyboard

00:15:29.136 --> 00:15:34.656 A:middle
and not all applications have
complete accessibility support.

00:15:34.656 --> 00:15:36.616 A:middle
Generally, they do
have good support,

00:15:36.966 --> 00:15:38.516 A:middle
but that could also be an issue.

00:15:38.516 --> 00:15:41.016 A:middle
You might not be able to
give a command for the thing

00:15:41.016 --> 00:15:42.176 A:middle
that you want it to do.

00:15:43.846 --> 00:15:47.096 A:middle
But here's the good
news user commands.

00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:50.746 A:middle
This is where we leave the
world of accessibility behind.

00:15:51.536 --> 00:15:56.036 A:middle
This is where the power of
automation and the power

00:15:56.036 --> 00:15:58.576 A:middle
of speech recognition
fuse together

00:15:58.936 --> 00:16:01.076 A:middle
to produce incredible tools.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.936 --> 00:16:01.076 A:middle
to produce incredible tools.

00:16:01.636 --> 00:16:04.546 A:middle
So let me show you how you
access these on the computer.

00:16:05.796 --> 00:16:09.836 A:middle
So in this window is a
secret button for turning

00:16:09.836 --> 00:16:15.036 A:middle
on this power ability and it
is right here, this + button.

00:16:15.856 --> 00:16:19.056 A:middle
It doesn't look like much, it
looks like any other + button,

00:16:19.296 --> 00:16:24.956 A:middle
but when you press that + button
a new suite is added called User

00:16:24.956 --> 00:16:29.196 A:middle
Commands and by default a new
blank command is set up for you.

00:16:29.806 --> 00:16:34.396 A:middle
So now we can create our own
command and to do that I'm going

00:16:34.396 --> 00:16:38.326 A:middle
to describe some parameters on
the left-hand side beginning

00:16:38.326 --> 00:16:41.686 A:middle
with what is the phrase that
I want to use as a command.

00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:46.046 A:middle
So let's say I want to create
a command to tell the computer

00:16:46.046 --> 00:16:47.856 A:middle
to take my picture right.

00:16:48.306 --> 00:16:50.886 A:middle
So I enter take my
picture in there.

00:16:50.886 --> 00:16:54.246 A:middle
So when I say the words take my
picture the computer will do the

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:56.236 A:middle
actions I want it to do.

00:16:56.826 --> 00:17:01.236 A:middle
Now you can determine if this
command is always available


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:56.826 --> 00:17:01.236 A:middle
Now you can determine if this
command is always available

00:17:01.236 --> 00:17:04.116 A:middle
or only within a
specific application

00:17:04.116 --> 00:17:05.646 A:middle
by selecting it from
this pop-up.

00:17:05.646 --> 00:17:08.195 A:middle
I'm going to leave it
set for Any Application.

00:17:08.866 --> 00:17:14.326 A:middle
And to perform the action you
have a menu of possible things

00:17:14.356 --> 00:17:19.026 A:middle
that the computer will do for
you upon dictating that command.

00:17:19.386 --> 00:17:22.776 A:middle
You can have the computer
open up certain finder items

00:17:22.776 --> 00:17:24.996 A:middle
like certain documents
that you want opened.

00:17:25.606 --> 00:17:28.766 A:middle
You can have the computer
open a specific URL.

00:17:29.056 --> 00:17:31.746 A:middle
You can have it paste
text that you've liked

00:17:31.746 --> 00:17:33.736 A:middle
like your favorite
legalese statement.

00:17:34.156 --> 00:17:37.816 A:middle
You can have it paste data like
your favorite corporate logo.

00:17:38.326 --> 00:17:40.706 A:middle
You can have it press
a keyboard shortcut.

00:17:41.166 --> 00:17:44.066 A:middle
You can have it select any
menu in any application

00:17:44.556 --> 00:17:48.046 A:middle
and you can even have it
run an Automator workflow

00:17:48.046 --> 00:17:50.586 A:middle
or AppleScript or
JavaScript script.

00:17:50.826 --> 00:17:52.846 A:middle
And as a matter fact
the OS ships

00:17:52.846 --> 00:17:55.836 A:middle
with nine pre-done
Automator workflows for you.

00:17:56.316 --> 00:17:59.936 A:middle
The first three here are
for starting a recording

00:17:59.936 --> 00:18:01.076 A:middle
in the QuickTime player.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:59.936 --> 00:18:01.076 A:middle
in the QuickTime player.

00:18:01.076 --> 00:18:02.976 A:middle
You can say new audio recording,

00:18:02.976 --> 00:18:05.066 A:middle
new screen recording,
new video recording.

00:18:05.066 --> 00:18:08.806 A:middle
There is one for going to
the Apple website of course

00:18:09.556 --> 00:18:13.066 A:middle
and there are five for
navigating within iTunes.

00:18:13.346 --> 00:18:16.286 A:middle
So you can say show me
the top family movies

00:18:16.286 --> 00:18:18.186 A:middle
and it will go right
to that page

00:18:18.186 --> 00:18:20.246 A:middle
within the iTunes application.

00:18:20.946 --> 00:18:24.416 A:middle
And at the bottom is
a choice for other

00:18:24.416 --> 00:18:28.036 A:middle
that will let you pick
your own Automator workflow

00:18:28.036 --> 00:18:31.206 A:middle
or own JavaScript or
AppleScript script and make

00:18:31.206 --> 00:18:32.966 A:middle
that the action that gets run.

00:18:33.536 --> 00:18:35.786 A:middle
But you'll notice there is
one for take my picture,

00:18:35.786 --> 00:18:38.866 A:middle
so I'm going to select that
and click the Done button

00:18:38.866 --> 00:18:40.266 A:middle
to create this command.

00:18:40.266 --> 00:18:43.876 A:middle
And it automatically gets
added to the list of commands.

00:18:44.106 --> 00:18:48.736 A:middle
So my user suite now has one
command called take my picture

00:18:48.976 --> 00:18:51.006 A:middle
and this is what it looks
like when you run it.

00:18:51.866 --> 00:18:57.396 A:middle
So I start dictation, I go
take my picture, it recognizes,

00:18:57.656 --> 00:19:04.306 A:middle
brings up the camera picker, I
smile and it takes my picture


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:57.656 --> 00:19:04.306 A:middle
brings up the camera picker, I
smile and it takes my picture

00:19:04.306 --> 00:19:06.386 A:middle
and puts it in photos
for me automatically.

00:19:08.496 --> 00:19:14.016 A:middle
So user commands are different
than the other types of commands

00:19:14.206 --> 00:19:16.446 A:middle
because they're task oriented.

00:19:16.866 --> 00:19:19.496 A:middle
They're not so much procedural
where you're telling it

00:19:19.496 --> 00:19:21.656 A:middle
to do this, then
this, then this.

00:19:22.236 --> 00:19:25.766 A:middle
You're basically
giving a command

00:19:26.126 --> 00:19:30.226 A:middle
to execute this particular task
no matter how many steps it

00:19:30.226 --> 00:19:32.316 A:middle
takes, no matter
what it needs to do.

00:19:32.926 --> 00:19:36.436 A:middle
And it really does expose
all the power of automation

00:19:37.226 --> 00:19:40.036 A:middle
that is available to you
on the operating system.

00:19:41.206 --> 00:19:43.786 A:middle
And you still get all the
other dictation abilities

00:19:43.786 --> 00:19:45.506 A:middle
that you currently have
with the other ones.

00:19:45.846 --> 00:19:49.156 A:middle
It's hands-free, always
on, visual feedback,

00:19:49.406 --> 00:19:50.826 A:middle
you don't need a net connect.

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:53.126 A:middle
It is incredibly powerful,

00:19:53.596 --> 00:19:56.506 A:middle
but as you saw how
many steps it took me

00:19:56.506 --> 00:20:01.766 A:middle
to make a user dictation command
if I wanted to make a hundred


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:56.506 --> 00:20:01.766 A:middle
to make a user dictation command
if I wanted to make a hundred

00:20:01.766 --> 00:20:05.106 A:middle
of those to really do
something with a particular app,

00:20:05.466 --> 00:20:07.056 A:middle
it might be a little
bit cumbersome

00:20:07.056 --> 00:20:09.606 A:middle
to create that until today.

00:20:11.026 --> 00:20:14.976 A:middle
Today, there's a set of
custom dictation commands

00:20:14.976 --> 00:20:17.356 A:middle
that I'm going to give you today

00:20:18.086 --> 00:20:22.026 A:middle
that will let you control
the Finder iWork and Photos

00:20:22.336 --> 00:20:23.656 A:middle
and some of the other apps.

00:20:24.246 --> 00:20:26.926 A:middle
And they take advantage
of this automation

00:20:26.996 --> 00:20:30.526 A:middle
and speech recognition
technology together.

00:20:31.486 --> 00:20:36.566 A:middle
So let me switch over here and
we'll watch these in action.

00:20:37.196 --> 00:20:43.486 A:middle
Okay, so I'm getting over a
cold my voice is a bit lower,

00:20:43.486 --> 00:20:46.056 A:middle
so we'll see if she even
pays attention to me today.

00:20:46.636 --> 00:20:48.856 A:middle
And I have a mic set
up here because we're

00:20:48.856 --> 00:20:50.496 A:middle
in this huge boomy
[phonetic] room.

00:20:50.496 --> 00:20:53.006 A:middle
But let me tell you
when I'm in the office

00:20:53.136 --> 00:20:57.156 A:middle
at Apple I just use the computer
it's open there connected

00:20:57.156 --> 00:21:00.446 A:middle
to my monitor and I can talk to
this thing from across the room


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:57.156 --> 00:21:00.446 A:middle
to my monitor and I can talk to
this thing from across the room

00:21:00.446 --> 00:21:01.406 A:middle
and it works perfectly.

00:21:01.796 --> 00:21:05.356 A:middle
So I'm going to be using
this today and I expect one

00:21:05.356 --> 00:21:07.626 A:middle
or two errors, but
let's see what happens.

00:21:07.746 --> 00:21:09.056 A:middle
So let's try that thing

00:21:09.056 --> 00:21:12.806 A:middle
about creating a new
presentation in Keynote.

00:21:13.286 --> 00:21:21.266 A:middle
Switch to Keynote, make
a new presentation okay.

00:21:21.416 --> 00:21:25.006 A:middle
How about let's make
a different one.

00:21:26.016 --> 00:21:28.216 A:middle
Make a wide presentation,
oh okay.

00:21:28.856 --> 00:21:33.686 A:middle
How about one with a
particular template.

00:21:34.636 --> 00:21:38.076 A:middle
Make a new wide presentation
using the gradient template.

00:21:38.076 --> 00:21:42.456 A:middle
Oh that's pretty good,
let's try a different theme.

00:21:43.736 --> 00:21:47.926 A:middle
Make a new standard presentation
with the brush canvas theme.

00:21:49.076 --> 00:21:51.536 A:middle
Pretty good.

00:21:53.176 --> 00:21:54.486 A:middle
Close all without saving.

00:21:57.606 --> 00:22:02.556 A:middle
So the whole idea of
having to be procedural


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:57.606 --> 00:22:02.556 A:middle
So the whole idea of
having to be procedural

00:22:03.356 --> 00:22:05.036 A:middle
to create a document
you saw me go

00:22:05.036 --> 00:22:07.226 A:middle
through all the steps
is now like no.

00:22:07.906 --> 00:22:11.296 A:middle
I'm thinking about what I need
to do, give me a new document

00:22:11.296 --> 00:22:14.106 A:middle
with this template, this
width I'm done, I'm there.

00:22:15.296 --> 00:22:19.166 A:middle
So that's good for
creating a new document,

00:22:19.166 --> 00:22:22.606 A:middle
let's see how you can work
with an existing document.

00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:26.326 A:middle
So let me pull up a document
that I have on the computer

00:22:26.326 --> 00:22:29.496 A:middle
and let's work with
it a little bit.

00:22:29.706 --> 00:22:32.596 A:middle
Search spotlight for
presentation the States

00:22:32.656 --> 00:22:41.000 A:middle
of the United States,
open result.

00:22:49.056 --> 00:22:50.046 A:middle
She's chugging today.

00:22:51.216 --> 00:22:54.976 A:middle
Start at the top.

00:22:55.516 --> 00:23:02.606 A:middle
[ Music ]


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:55.516 --> 00:23:02.606 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:23:03.106 --> 00:23:05.206 A:middle
Oh I'm good with slides,
I'm good with slides.

00:23:06.508 --> 00:23:08.508 A:middle
[ Music ]

00:23:11.046 --> 00:23:11.536 A:middle
Next slide.

00:23:16.476 --> 00:23:18.016 A:middle
Go to slide nine.

00:23:22.396 --> 00:23:24.206 A:middle
Read the presenter notes.

00:23:24.726 --> 00:23:29.176 A:middle
Read the presenter notes.

00:23:29.796 --> 00:23:32.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; California's diverse
geography ranges

00:23:32.816 --> 00:23:35.886 A:middle
from the Sierra Nevada in
the east to the Pacific Coast

00:23:35.886 --> 00:23:38.646 A:middle
in the west and from the
redwood forests of the northwest

00:23:39.116 --> 00:23:41.666 A:middle
to the Mohave Desert
areas in the southeast.

00:23:42.406 --> 00:23:47.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Tell me about this image.

00:23:47.446 --> 00:23:50.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Although Death Valley is a
below sea level basin a great

00:23:50.666 --> 00:23:53.526 A:middle
diversity of life flourishes
in this land of extremes.

00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:56.176 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Take a break.

00:23:57.266 --> 00:23:59.656 A:middle
Take a break.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:01.156 --> 00:24:07.146 A:middle
Export the presenter
notes to mail.

00:24:08.296 --> 00:24:10.186 A:middle
Export presenter notes to mail.

00:24:10.726 --> 00:24:16.576 A:middle
That's pretty handy I could
use that a couple times.

00:24:17.986 --> 00:24:20.826 A:middle
Switch to Keynote.

00:24:22.256 --> 00:24:25.526 A:middle
Show related items.

00:24:27.436 --> 00:24:30.696 A:middle
So we have a spotlight window
down here with all the items

00:24:30.696 --> 00:24:31.896 A:middle
that are related to this.

00:24:32.126 --> 00:24:36.516 A:middle
There's a GarageBand file with
the shaker song in it okay.

00:24:37.096 --> 00:24:39.256 A:middle
There's even the email
that I just sent.

00:24:39.256 --> 00:24:42.316 A:middle
There's a bunch of
images that I used.

00:24:42.846 --> 00:24:45.516 A:middle
There's a picture
of the US flag.

00:24:45.516 --> 00:24:51.236 A:middle
There's also an audio
recording that I put in right,

00:24:51.236 --> 00:24:53.286 A:middle
that was the audio
recording and some links.

00:24:53.796 --> 00:24:57.866 A:middle
So it was really easy for me
to find things that are related

00:24:57.866 --> 00:25:02.096 A:middle
to the document that I'm working
on just by asking for them.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:57.866 --> 00:25:02.096 A:middle
to the document that I'm working
on just by asking for them.

00:25:02.646 --> 00:25:04.156 A:middle
Close this without saving.

00:25:04.776 --> 00:25:11.436 A:middle
So you can see this concept

00:25:12.146 --> 00:25:16.556 A:middle
of having task oriented
things is really useful

00:25:17.136 --> 00:25:20.816 A:middle
because it doesn't really
interfere with the mental flow

00:25:20.816 --> 00:25:24.686 A:middle
that you have going, especially
when you're creating something.

00:25:24.686 --> 00:25:28.436 A:middle
So let me use user commands
and dictation commands

00:25:29.096 --> 00:25:30.586 A:middle
to create some content.

00:25:30.626 --> 00:25:33.806 A:middle
So we've seen it open a
document, create a new document

00:25:33.806 --> 00:25:35.476 A:middle
and we've seen it
work with a document.

00:25:35.726 --> 00:25:39.456 A:middle
Let me actually create some
content using these commands.

00:25:39.926 --> 00:25:43.186 A:middle
Switch to photos.

00:25:44.486 --> 00:25:51.216 A:middle
These are some photos I took on
my trip down the Rhone River.

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:53.326 A:middle
I took one of those
Viking type cruises.

00:25:53.786 --> 00:25:55.696 A:middle
Lots of fun I highly
recommend that.

00:25:56.576 --> 00:25:57.856 A:middle
Select all photos.

00:25:58.886 --> 00:26:02.466 A:middle
Help me to add titles.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.886 --> 00:26:02.466 A:middle
Help me to add titles.

00:26:03.626 --> 00:26:08.146 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Enter the title
for image one of five.

00:26:08.346 --> 00:26:11.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You know, normally doing this
kind of thing is a real pain

00:26:11.066 --> 00:26:13.806 A:middle
because you've got to get down
there in the interface and look

00:26:13.806 --> 00:26:14.886 A:middle
at these little things.

00:26:14.886 --> 00:26:19.396 A:middle
And, you know, being able
to have this guide you

00:26:19.396 --> 00:26:22.026 A:middle
through something sometimes
is just the easiest way

00:26:22.026 --> 00:26:22.956 A:middle
to do something.

00:26:23.466 --> 00:26:26.686 A:middle
On the Rhone River yeah,

00:26:26.686 --> 00:26:28.866 A:middle
you need that special
character there.

00:26:29.566 --> 00:26:30.176 A:middle
Rhone River.

00:26:30.686 --> 00:26:33.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Five of five.

00:26:33.246 --> 00:26:35.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; This was an incredible
Roman temple right

00:26:35.706 --> 00:26:38.116 A:middle
in the middle of town.

00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:38.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Done.

00:26:40.556 --> 00:26:43.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So using that command I was
able to add titles to a bunch

00:26:43.536 --> 00:26:44.806 A:middle
of images really quickly.

00:26:46.276 --> 00:26:53.000 A:middle
Select all photos, make a
new presentation with these.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:07.196 --> 00:27:09.036 A:middle
Okay, so it just did [applause].

00:27:12.166 --> 00:27:13.686 A:middle
Yeah, I mean that's
a pain right,

00:27:13.686 --> 00:27:16.916 A:middle
who wants to do the 40 steps
that it takes to do that.

00:27:17.106 --> 00:27:20.236 A:middle
I can think of it why can't I
just ask the computer do it,

00:27:20.316 --> 00:27:21.806 A:middle
obviously it can right.

00:27:22.956 --> 00:27:23.926 A:middle
Go to slide one.

00:27:26.516 --> 00:27:28.936 A:middle
Change master slide
to title center.

00:27:31.416 --> 00:27:34.086 A:middle
Scratch that.

00:27:35.186 --> 00:27:37.606 A:middle
Change master slide
to title center.

00:27:42.556 --> 00:27:45.926 A:middle
And let's see vacation photos.

00:27:49.176 --> 00:27:59.696 A:middle
Select Photos, capitalize
that, stop, edit.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:01.116 --> 00:28:05.516 A:middle
Okay, let's see what
I've got here.

00:28:06.856 --> 00:28:09.916 A:middle
Move the slide to the end.

00:28:10.936 --> 00:28:11.396 A:middle
Okay.

00:28:12.666 --> 00:28:12.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Done.

00:28:13.046 --> 00:28:15.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And then I want this
to go down around there.

00:28:15.506 --> 00:28:18.956 A:middle
I think no, the lock came
first and then that okay.

00:28:19.026 --> 00:28:21.906 A:middle
This needs some tweaking,
this is bad.

00:28:22.786 --> 00:28:24.076 A:middle
Edit this in photos.

00:28:25.556 --> 00:28:30.546 A:middle
So the computer knows where
that photo came from doesn't it.

00:28:31.396 --> 00:28:34.666 A:middle
Why should I have to go spend my
time doing that kind of thing?

00:28:35.346 --> 00:28:38.026 A:middle
Let's set it to crop and I'll
straighten this out a little bit

00:28:38.426 --> 00:28:43.216 A:middle
and then as long as I'm adding
I'm going to crop it to get rid

00:28:43.216 --> 00:28:44.356 A:middle
of the guy standing there

00:28:44.356 --> 00:28:47.426 A:middle
and make this a little bit
more interesting, more focused

00:28:47.426 --> 00:28:51.576 A:middle
on the lock rather than the
rest of the stuff around it.

00:28:52.586 --> 00:28:54.996 A:middle
And Photos has some
nice little tools

00:28:54.996 --> 00:29:00.176 A:middle
for doing that, so
that looks good.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:54.996 --> 00:29:00.176 A:middle
for doing that, so
that looks good.

00:29:00.476 --> 00:29:01.546 A:middle
Show this in Keynote.

00:29:03.536 --> 00:29:05.186 A:middle
Show this in Keynote.

00:29:06.176 --> 00:29:09.716 A:middle
It knows where it
is in Keynote right.

00:29:10.896 --> 00:29:15.746 A:middle
Let me select it,
update this image.

00:29:16.316 --> 00:29:17.476 A:middle
Update this image.

00:29:18.356 --> 00:29:23.966 A:middle
So I don't have to go
through that whole process

00:29:23.966 --> 00:29:25.646 A:middle
about doing stuff
I'm just thinking,

00:29:25.646 --> 00:29:27.376 A:middle
I'm creating here
on the fly right.

00:29:27.796 --> 00:29:29.036 A:middle
Let's make his little bit bigger

00:29:29.036 --> 00:29:31.656 A:middle
so that it looks a little
bit more interesting.

00:29:32.256 --> 00:29:37.936 A:middle
And then -- oh this is
great, the Popes' Palace,

00:29:37.936 --> 00:29:38.916 A:middle
it's really interesting.

00:29:39.716 --> 00:29:42.616 A:middle
Show this in Maps.

00:29:45.056 --> 00:29:52.006 A:middle
So here it is in Maps and
let's use the nice 3-D feature

00:29:52.006 --> 00:29:53.116 A:middle
of Apple Maps.

00:29:53.316 --> 00:29:56.566 A:middle
And let's see if we can get a
nice background for that photo

00:29:56.566 --> 00:29:59.926 A:middle
to show people the context and
the fact that the thing's right

00:29:59.926 --> 00:30:01.976 A:middle
in the middle of this
old Roman part of town.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.926 --> 00:30:01.976 A:middle
in the middle of this
old Roman part of town.

00:30:02.566 --> 00:30:04.546 A:middle
You can see the circular
area that was

00:30:04.546 --> 00:30:08.246 A:middle
like the original
village there right.

00:30:08.906 --> 00:30:10.786 A:middle
Okay, export this
map to Keynote.

00:30:11.316 --> 00:30:18.606 A:middle
All right, very good
and let's kind

00:30:18.606 --> 00:30:21.296 A:middle
of crop this in here
a little bit.

00:30:21.296 --> 00:30:22.306 A:middle
There we go.

00:30:22.306 --> 00:30:28.596 A:middle
I haven't done the command
yet for crop the slide.

00:30:28.946 --> 00:30:30.756 A:middle
It's a good idea though.

00:30:30.986 --> 00:30:33.086 A:middle
Let's go paste it and
put it to the back here.

00:30:33.356 --> 00:30:36.146 A:middle
I'm going to copy this and
put this on top of this,

00:30:36.146 --> 00:30:37.756 A:middle
it's like a little trick right.

00:30:38.106 --> 00:30:41.316 A:middle
So that I can do like a
magic move and then reveal.

00:30:41.976 --> 00:30:45.866 A:middle
So I need to apply a magic move.

00:30:46.536 --> 00:30:48.066 A:middle
Apply magic move.

00:30:49.276 --> 00:30:50.426 A:middle
Apply a dissolve.

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:54.356 A:middle
Do that again.

00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:58.346 A:middle
Do that again.

00:30:59.216 --> 00:31:02.336 A:middle
Do that again.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:59.216 --> 00:31:02.336 A:middle
Do that again.

00:31:03.136 --> 00:31:08.686 A:middle
Okay, so I got the transitions
and then oh, Pont du Gard.

00:31:09.096 --> 00:31:12.016 A:middle
Okay, this one we need
to fix a little bit.

00:31:12.466 --> 00:31:14.426 A:middle
Scale this to fit slide width.

00:31:15.416 --> 00:31:19.206 A:middle
All right, that's good.

00:31:19.506 --> 00:31:23.426 A:middle
And make a long panoramic
sequence.

00:31:24.446 --> 00:31:25.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Done.

00:31:25.916 --> 00:31:30.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay and while we're
at it put descriptions

00:31:30.806 --> 00:31:31.976 A:middle
on top of every image.

00:31:36.076 --> 00:31:37.716 A:middle
That could take a while to do.

00:31:38.746 --> 00:31:43.186 A:middle
And so after this trip I was so
impressed with these locations

00:31:43.186 --> 00:31:45.596 A:middle
that I went on the
Internet, I did some research

00:31:45.596 --> 00:31:48.586 A:middle
as to how many people visit
these sites every year.

00:31:48.866 --> 00:31:51.236 A:middle
And I have a spreadsheet
that has that information.

00:31:52.196 --> 00:31:57.946 A:middle
Search spotlight for
spreadsheet tourism in France.

00:31:59.376 --> 00:31:59.976 A:middle
Open result.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:04.536 --> 00:32:08.626 A:middle
Select the table.

00:32:08.776 --> 00:32:14.936 A:middle
Select the table.

00:32:15.096 --> 00:32:17.536 A:middle
Export this table to
Keynote as a chart.

00:32:21.756 --> 00:32:24.546 A:middle
Export this table to
Keynote as a chart.

00:32:26.646 --> 00:32:29.656 A:middle
Good, that could be handy.

00:32:31.376 --> 00:32:33.326 A:middle
And let's scale this
down a little bit

00:32:33.326 --> 00:32:35.176 A:middle
so that it fits there nice.

00:32:35.356 --> 00:32:38.736 A:middle
Okay, start from the top.

00:32:39.556 --> 00:32:44.626 A:middle
All right, so this was a Roman
temple right in the middle

00:32:44.626 --> 00:32:46.056 A:middle
of town, it's been
around forever.

00:32:46.256 --> 00:32:48.566 A:middle
They actually turned it into
a movie theater for a while.

00:32:49.666 --> 00:32:52.546 A:middle
And this was us going through
a lock on the Rhone River,

00:32:52.546 --> 00:32:54.946 A:middle
there's about four or five
locks during the course of that.

00:32:55.286 --> 00:32:57.166 A:middle
This is the power
station that they use

00:32:57.166 --> 00:32:59.076 A:middle
to provide power for Arles.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:00.726 --> 00:33:02.706 A:middle
And this is Pont du Gard,

00:33:02.706 --> 00:33:05.376 A:middle
which is this incredible
Roman aqueduct

00:33:05.376 --> 00:33:07.426 A:middle
that was built like
3,000 years ago.

00:33:07.756 --> 00:33:11.976 A:middle
And the fact that this huge
thing that's three stories tall

00:33:12.406 --> 00:33:15.796 A:middle
it's still here today and
still in the condition it's

00:33:15.796 --> 00:33:17.516 A:middle
in is absolutely amazing.

00:33:17.906 --> 00:33:23.196 A:middle
It spans this entire long valley
and I'll bet if we try to do

00:33:23.196 --> 00:33:26.126 A:middle
that today it would run in
the billions of dollars.

00:33:26.436 --> 00:33:27.596 A:middle
But it's quite impressive.

00:33:28.206 --> 00:33:30.926 A:middle
And that's Pont du Gard.

00:33:31.316 --> 00:33:36.076 A:middle
And of course, there
is the Popes' Palace

00:33:36.586 --> 00:33:40.816 A:middle
and it's located right in the
center of the old Roman town

00:33:40.996 --> 00:33:42.086 A:middle
like you can see here.

00:33:42.856 --> 00:33:45.526 A:middle
And people find these
sites really interesting,

00:33:45.526 --> 00:33:47.346 A:middle
there's millions and
millions means of people

00:33:47.346 --> 00:33:48.906 A:middle
that visit these every year.

00:33:49.546 --> 00:33:51.066 A:middle
Save this presentation.

00:33:51.936 --> 00:33:59.566 A:middle
And as a matter fact, why
don't I while I'm at it,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:00.396 --> 00:34:02.446 A:middle
but I don't have
a free port here.

00:34:03.136 --> 00:34:05.736 A:middle
Let's see if I can copy
this to my thumb drive.

00:34:06.516 --> 00:34:11.456 A:middle
So I'm going to stick
a thumb drive in here.

00:34:11.696 --> 00:34:15.406 A:middle
Save this presentation to
my thumb drive and eject it.

00:34:17.235 --> 00:34:19.216 A:middle
Scratch that.

00:34:21.456 --> 00:34:23.755 A:middle
Scratch that.

00:34:24.726 --> 00:34:29.246 A:middle
Save this presentation to
my thumb drive and eject it.

00:34:29.616 --> 00:34:31.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Saving document
vacation photos

00:34:31.536 --> 00:34:33.146 A:middle
to drive digital briefcase.

00:34:34.056 --> 00:34:35.985 A:middle
Dismounting digital briefcase.

00:34:37.866 --> 00:34:41.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So this is the kind of thing
that you can do where, you know,

00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:43.856 A:middle
you're still in the
application you don't have

00:34:43.856 --> 00:34:46.146 A:middle
to leave what you're doing
to dismount something,

00:34:46.146 --> 00:34:47.815 A:middle
to eject something,
to copy something.

00:34:47.815 --> 00:34:48.045 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Done.

00:34:48.295 --> 00:34:49.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That deals something
with the Finder.

00:34:49.896 --> 00:34:52.306 A:middle
I mean you just tell
the computer to do it.

00:34:52.306 --> 00:34:54.176 A:middle
It knows how to do
this stuff right.

00:34:54.496 --> 00:34:57.306 A:middle
Why shouldn't we just be
able to tell it to do that?

00:34:58.026 --> 00:35:00.356 A:middle
So where do you get this stuff?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.026 --> 00:35:00.356 A:middle
So where do you get this stuff?

00:35:01.686 --> 00:35:03.000 A:middle
Add a blank slide.

00:35:26.046 --> 00:35:28.506 A:middle
Turn this into a QR code.

00:35:30.666 --> 00:35:32.986 A:middle
Scale down 10%.

00:35:34.596 --> 00:35:37.496 A:middle
Scale down 10%.

00:35:38.916 --> 00:35:40.486 A:middle
Scale down 10%.

00:35:41.526 --> 00:35:43.136 A:middle
There we go.

00:35:43.906 --> 00:35:48.036 A:middle
So all of this material is
available for to you today

00:35:48.036 --> 00:35:49.506 A:middle
and I'm going to show
you where to get it.

00:35:50.056 --> 00:35:57.926 A:middle
So let's go back to the slides
here and my slide advancer.

00:35:58.376 --> 00:36:01.926 A:middle
So what are these type
of commands useful for?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:58.376 --> 00:36:01.926 A:middle
So what are these type
of commands useful for?

00:36:02.626 --> 00:36:05.956 A:middle
Well we saw that they're really
good for when you want to remain

00:36:05.956 --> 00:36:09.436 A:middle
in context and you want actions
and tasks performed for you.

00:36:10.156 --> 00:36:13.646 A:middle
They are really good for
performing multistep tasks

00:36:14.416 --> 00:36:16.786 A:middle
and like when I had to
go through and name all

00:36:16.786 --> 00:36:19.726 A:middle
of those images, so that I could
use their descriptions later.

00:36:20.656 --> 00:36:23.476 A:middle
They're also good for tasks
that require dexterity.

00:36:23.716 --> 00:36:28.616 A:middle
Can you imagine copying the
description from an image file

00:36:28.616 --> 00:36:32.956 A:middle
on a slide and then creating a
text box, placing it just so on

00:36:32.956 --> 00:36:35.676 A:middle
that and doing that for
an entire presentation?

00:36:36.146 --> 00:36:39.416 A:middle
Boy, you have to be a wizard
to be able to do that quickly.

00:36:39.716 --> 00:36:41.376 A:middle
But with voice command,

00:36:41.376 --> 00:36:45.016 A:middle
with a dictation command that's
just asking that be done.

00:36:46.006 --> 00:36:47.286 A:middle
You can also move data.

00:36:47.286 --> 00:36:52.126 A:middle
So like I had the map in Maps,
I wanted it over in Keynote.

00:36:52.426 --> 00:36:55.856 A:middle
So voice commands and dictation
commands are perfect for that

00:36:56.316 --> 00:36:59.016 A:middle
and excellent for
data transformation.

00:36:59.276 --> 00:37:04.466 A:middle
So I had a table with data that
I wanted as a chart in Keynote


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:59.276 --> 00:37:04.466 A:middle
So I had a table with data that
I wanted as a chart in Keynote

00:37:04.836 --> 00:37:08.316 A:middle
and I was able to give it a
command and have that executed.

00:37:09.786 --> 00:37:12.756 A:middle
You can perform tasks
that aren't available

00:37:12.756 --> 00:37:14.836 A:middle
in the application
UI that you're in.

00:37:14.906 --> 00:37:17.726 A:middle
For example, turn
this into a QR code.

00:37:17.886 --> 00:37:20.436 A:middle
That's a perfect example of
something you'd want to do

00:37:20.436 --> 00:37:23.686 A:middle
in a presentation, but
it's just not there.

00:37:24.756 --> 00:37:28.736 A:middle
And things that the user wants
to do, but doesn't know how.

00:37:28.736 --> 00:37:31.526 A:middle
Man, all the people in
my family do not know how

00:37:31.526 --> 00:37:35.296 A:middle
to use the Clipboard, do not
know how to do a screen capture,

00:37:35.536 --> 00:37:37.526 A:middle
do not know how to use AirDrop.

00:37:37.876 --> 00:37:41.166 A:middle
So being able to do that with
a spoken dictation command

00:37:41.166 --> 00:37:41.996 A:middle
is perfect.

00:37:43.346 --> 00:37:44.976 A:middle
So what are they good for?

00:37:45.146 --> 00:37:49.106 A:middle
Dictation commands are good for
solving all of these problems

00:37:49.386 --> 00:37:51.056 A:middle
and for being a solution.

00:37:51.636 --> 00:37:55.206 A:middle
So how does it work?

00:37:55.826 --> 00:38:00.776 A:middle
Well, I only have a couple
minutes so I'm going to kind


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:37:55.826 --> 00:38:00.776 A:middle
Well, I only have a couple
minutes so I'm going to kind

00:38:00.776 --> 00:38:06.586 A:middle
of boot out of that for a second
and jump past that section.

00:38:07.116 --> 00:38:11.426 A:middle
It's basically magic and
I'm going to kick back in

00:38:12.526 --> 00:38:16.456 A:middle
and tell you where to go
to get these resources.

00:38:16.906 --> 00:38:19.036 A:middle
Everything you need to
know about how they work

00:38:19.476 --> 00:38:22.776 A:middle
and the collection I just
showed you is available for you

00:38:22.776 --> 00:38:24.986 A:middle
on dictationcommands.com.

00:38:25.726 --> 00:38:30.236 A:middle
So to summarize, the power
of speech recognition

00:38:30.236 --> 00:38:33.726 A:middle
and automation working
together makes it

00:38:33.726 --> 00:38:37.326 A:middle
so that dictation is no
longer just another way

00:38:37.646 --> 00:38:39.956 A:middle
to enter text into a text field.

00:38:40.716 --> 00:38:44.456 A:middle
And speech is no longer just
an assistive technology.

00:38:45.286 --> 00:38:50.426 A:middle
And now voice is a peer
to touch, keys and cursor.

00:38:51.146 --> 00:38:53.476 A:middle
You can use your
voice the same way

00:38:53.476 --> 00:38:56.016 A:middle
that you use the other
inputs into the computer.

00:38:57.286 --> 00:39:02.466 A:middle
And this is what's possible
when you have macOS and all


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:57.286 --> 00:39:02.466 A:middle
And this is what's possible
when you have macOS and all

00:39:02.466 --> 00:39:04.336 A:middle
of these technologies
working together.

00:39:04.336 --> 00:39:06.636 A:middle
It's only something that
can happen on a Mac.

00:39:07.406 --> 00:39:10.416 A:middle
So thank you so much for
being part of my day.

00:39:10.416 --> 00:39:11.646 A:middle
Thank you for being here.
