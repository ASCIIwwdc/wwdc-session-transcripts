00:00:28.606 --> 00:00:29.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good evening.

00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:31.906 A:middle
My name is Robby Walker,
tonight I will be joined

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:35.376 A:middle
by Brandon Newendorp and Corey
Peterson to talk about SiriKit.

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.906 A:middle
First I'm going to start
by talking a little bit

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:42.016 A:middle
about what SiriKit is, and at
a high level, how it works.

00:00:43.146 --> 00:00:45.456 A:middle
Then Brandon's going to talk
about building an extension

00:00:45.456 --> 00:00:48.186 A:middle
or two to connect your
application to SiriKit.

00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:51.196 A:middle
And then Corey's going to
talk about how to build

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:53.816 A:middle
and design a great
conversational experience,

00:00:53.976 --> 00:00:55.106 A:middle
which is meaningfully different

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:57.356 A:middle
than designing a great
graphical user interface.

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:00.206 A:middle
But first, let's
talk about Siri.

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:00.206 A:middle
But first, let's
talk about Siri.

00:01:00.206 --> 00:01:00.906 A:middle
Who is Siri?

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:07.816 A:middle
Siri is your virtual assistant,
always ready to help you,

00:01:08.046 --> 00:01:08.976 A:middle
whether it's by adding
a bit of humor,

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:15.896 A:middle
or much more frequently, by
helping you get things done,

00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:19.376 A:middle
and alerting you to potential
conflicts proactively.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:23.076 A:middle
We're going to talk about an
example app that integrates

00:01:23.076 --> 00:01:25.436 A:middle
with Siri, and when
we built this app,

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.646 A:middle
we built a fake application.

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:29.646 A:middle
So we wanted to name it
after something fake,

00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:32.056 A:middle
but we kind of felt like it was
really valuable so we wanted

00:01:32.056 --> 00:01:34.346 A:middle
to name it after a very
valuable sounding fake thing.

00:01:34.836 --> 00:01:36.276 A:middle
So we called it Unicorn Chat.

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:40.616 A:middle
And then because we wanted it
to seem even more valuable,

00:01:40.896 --> 00:01:41.976 A:middle
we gave it a really sweet icon.

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:48.136 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:50.796 A:middle
So you can imagine someone
saying something like, "Hey,

00:01:50.796 --> 00:01:52.576 A:middle
Siri, send a Unicorn
Chat message."

00:01:53.896 --> 00:01:55.666 A:middle
Siri might respond "To whom?"

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.006 A:middle
Then you might say,
"Celestra", which is one

00:01:58.006 --> 00:01:59.936 A:middle
of the Unicorn names of
one of my colleagues.

00:02:00.596 --> 00:02:03.216 A:middle
Then you would -- then Siri
would ask, "What do you want

00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:05.996 A:middle
to say to Celestra, and then
I might say something like,

00:02:06.246 --> 00:02:07.766 A:middle
"Let's add more sparkle
transitions,"

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:08.846 A:middle
because as everyone knows,

00:02:09.076 --> 00:02:10.436 A:middle
Unicorns love sparkle
transitions.

00:02:11.036 --> 00:02:13.946 A:middle
But there's a lot of ways to
say the same thing to Siri.

00:02:15.556 --> 00:02:18.366 A:middle
Someone else might say
it in just two steps,

00:02:18.616 --> 00:02:19.916 A:middle
saying something
like, "Send a message

00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:21.316 A:middle
to Celestra in Unicorn Chat."

00:02:21.316 --> 00:02:24.586 A:middle
And then of course, Siri
would ask a question

00:02:24.586 --> 00:02:27.996 A:middle
and then the user would fill
in the rest of their intent.

00:02:27.996 --> 00:02:30.936 A:middle
Other users might do the exact
same thing in only one line,

00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:33.446 A:middle
"Unicorn Chat Celestra, let's
add more sparkle transitions."

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:37.416 A:middle
Somebody else might say an
equivalent concept in Chinese,

00:02:37.606 --> 00:02:40.716 A:middle
which I will not attempt to say.

00:02:40.716 --> 00:02:43.516 A:middle
And other users will be
incredibly polite and verbose,

00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:45.486 A:middle
and might say something
like, "Hey, Siri,

00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:48.076 A:middle
can you please do me a favor
and launch the Unicorn Chat app

00:02:48.076 --> 00:02:49.926 A:middle
to send a text with the
message let's add more

00:02:49.926 --> 00:02:50.806 A:middle
sparkle transitions."

00:02:51.556 --> 00:02:54.326 A:middle
And despite using 27 words
to describe a simple concept,

00:02:54.326 --> 00:02:56.186 A:middle
they actually forgot to
say who they were going

00:02:56.186 --> 00:02:56.866 A:middle
to send the message to.

00:02:56.936 --> 00:03:00.836 A:middle
And then even then, they
would be incredibly verbose

00:02:56.936 --> 00:03:00.836 A:middle
And then even then, they
would be incredibly verbose

00:03:00.836 --> 00:03:02.736 A:middle
and say something like, "My
very best friend Celestra."

00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:05.856 A:middle
So the point is, there
are a lot of ways

00:03:05.856 --> 00:03:07.276 A:middle
to say the same thing to Siri.

00:03:07.276 --> 00:03:10.146 A:middle
And there are also a lot of
ways that Siri will respond.

00:03:10.506 --> 00:03:12.686 A:middle
So for example, if
you're holding your phone,

00:03:12.686 --> 00:03:14.766 A:middle
and you're pressing the
Home button, Siri's going

00:03:14.766 --> 00:03:17.626 A:middle
to provide more visual responses
and say less things out loud.

00:03:18.146 --> 00:03:20.136 A:middle
But if you're invoking
using Hey Siri,

00:03:20.376 --> 00:03:23.156 A:middle
like our friend Cookie Monster,
or if you're in the car,

00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:25.676 A:middle
Siri's going to say
more and show you less.

00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:29.096 A:middle
And the Siri experience is
also carefully optimized

00:03:29.206 --> 00:03:31.666 A:middle
to meet the accessibility
needs of our users and responds

00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:34.016 A:middle
to a lot of different
accessibility settings.

00:03:35.376 --> 00:03:37.426 A:middle
So in the end of the day,

00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:40.436 A:middle
there's basically a
combinatorial explosion of ways

00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:41.746 A:middle
that people use Siri,
both in terms

00:03:41.746 --> 00:03:43.806 A:middle
of how they phrase
something to Siri and in terms

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.226 A:middle
of how Siri will respond.

00:03:45.656 --> 00:03:47.216 A:middle
And the question then becomes,

00:03:47.606 --> 00:03:49.586 A:middle
how do we make sure we're
building a high quality

00:03:49.586 --> 00:03:51.756 A:middle
experience for our users?

00:03:51.956 --> 00:03:55.176 A:middle
How do we make sure it's really
consistent across applications

00:03:55.176 --> 00:03:56.056 A:middle
within a single domain?

00:03:56.816 --> 00:03:58.686 A:middle
And most importantly, for
everyone in this room,

00:03:59.036 --> 00:04:00.726 A:middle
how do we make sure it's
nice and easy to adopt,

00:03:59.036 --> 00:04:00.726 A:middle
how do we make sure it's
nice and easy to adopt,

00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:03.116 A:middle
so that as many people as
possible can use as many

00:04:03.116 --> 00:04:05.446 A:middle
of their favorite applications
in a conversational way?

00:04:05.446 --> 00:04:09.446 A:middle
And the answer is that Siri
handles the conversation

00:04:09.826 --> 00:04:11.936 A:middle
and your application just
handles the functionality

00:04:11.936 --> 00:04:14.276 A:middle
So I'll go into a little more
detail about what that means.

00:04:15.576 --> 00:04:16.906 A:middle
The first thing that Siri does,

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:18.846 A:middle
is understand what
the user said.

00:04:18.846 --> 00:04:21.805 A:middle
So we take audio and
we turn it into text.

00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:24.226 A:middle
Then we take that
text and we turn it

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:26.276 A:middle
into a structured representation
of what the user is trying

00:04:26.276 --> 00:04:28.216 A:middle
to do, something
we call an intent.

00:04:28.926 --> 00:04:32.386 A:middle
Based on that intent, Siri then
takes action performing the task

00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:33.676 A:middle
the user wanted to accomplish.

00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:37.006 A:middle
And then Siri provides
responses as I said,

00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:38.246 A:middle
both visual and verbal.

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:40.406 A:middle
And so there's a lot here.

00:04:40.576 --> 00:04:42.446 A:middle
There's a lot of work that
goes into these four steps.

00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:44.506 A:middle
There's a lot of deep
learning technologies.

00:04:44.506 --> 00:04:45.866 A:middle
There's convolutional
neural nets.

00:04:45.866 --> 00:04:47.026 A:middle
There's LSTMs, there's CRFs,

00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:49.126 A:middle
there's SVMs, there's
a lot here.

00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:51.366 A:middle
And we wanted to make sure
that as app developers,

00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:53.316 A:middle
you could really
focus on the things

00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:55.596 A:middle
that your app already does, and
there's three parts to that.

00:04:56.626 --> 00:04:57.836 A:middle
The first one is vocabulary.

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:01.136 A:middle
This is how your application
tells Siri words Siri needs

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:01.136 A:middle
This is how your application
tells Siri words Siri needs

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:01.666 A:middle
to know about.

00:05:02.106 --> 00:05:04.156 A:middle
And Brandon will tell you
more about it in a bit.

00:05:04.576 --> 00:05:06.326 A:middle
The second one is app logic.

00:05:06.696 --> 00:05:08.476 A:middle
This is the functionality
of your application.

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:11.416 A:middle
And then the last one is of
course, a great user interface.

00:05:12.836 --> 00:05:14.186 A:middle
So let's go through
this example again,

00:05:14.186 --> 00:05:15.356 A:middle
and see a little bit
about how it works.

00:05:17.566 --> 00:05:18.916 A:middle
So somebody says, "Hey Siri,

00:05:18.916 --> 00:05:20.826 A:middle
please send a Unicorn
Chat message to Celestra."

00:05:21.436 --> 00:05:23.176 A:middle
The first rule that your
application plays is

00:05:23.176 --> 00:05:24.656 A:middle
to help Siri understand
the speech.

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:26.746 A:middle
So Siri doesn't have
the name Celestra

00:05:27.296 --> 00:05:29.686 A:middle
in its database,
but your app does.

00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:31.836 A:middle
So by sharing that information
with Siri, you make sure

00:05:31.836 --> 00:05:33.216 A:middle
that Siri understands
what the user said.

00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:36.496 A:middle
This also helps Siri
identify the fact

00:05:36.496 --> 00:05:37.756 A:middle
that Celestra is a contact

00:05:37.756 --> 00:05:39.206 A:middle
because when you provide
this kind vocabulary,

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:41.526 A:middle
you will provide it by saying
these are names of contacts,

00:05:41.526 --> 00:05:42.916 A:middle
or in another example
it might be,

00:05:42.916 --> 00:05:45.546 A:middle
these are names of photo albums.

00:05:45.706 --> 00:05:48.316 A:middle
Now Siri understands that
in the messaging domain,

00:05:48.316 --> 00:05:49.916 A:middle
to send a message you
actually need more than,

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:50.926 A:middle
of course, just a recipient.

00:05:50.926 --> 00:05:51.816 A:middle
You need a message.

00:05:52.146 --> 00:05:55.016 A:middle
And so Siri will quickly check
with your extension to ask,

00:05:55.016 --> 00:05:57.916 A:middle
"Do you actually require
content for this message?"

00:05:57.976 --> 00:05:59.616 A:middle
And if your application
says yes,

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:01.656 A:middle
then Siri will ask a
follow up question.

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:01.656 A:middle
then Siri will ask a
follow up question.

00:06:02.016 --> 00:06:04.096 A:middle
So really that's all your
application has to do is sort

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:07.356 A:middle
of specify on an individual
parameter basis what are

00:06:07.356 --> 00:06:07.976 A:middle
your constraints.

00:06:11.126 --> 00:06:13.046 A:middle
The next thing that happens
is Siri structures all

00:06:13.046 --> 00:06:14.516 A:middle
that information
up into an object.

00:06:14.866 --> 00:06:16.806 A:middle
So rather than having to
deal with all of the vagaries

00:06:16.806 --> 00:06:19.336 A:middle
of language and phrasing, and
all those things that we talked

00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:21.736 A:middle
about earlier, your application
really just gets this nice

00:06:21.736 --> 00:06:22.426 A:middle
simple object.

00:06:22.936 --> 00:06:25.826 A:middle
And then it hands off to your
application to help with,

00:06:26.046 --> 00:06:29.896 A:middle
you know, processing the intent
and performing the action.

00:06:30.046 --> 00:06:30.816 A:middle
And then of course,
along the way,

00:06:30.816 --> 00:06:32.806 A:middle
Siri provides a user
interface for the user.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.026 A:middle
And you have the option to
provide a second extension

00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:38.976 A:middle
to customize the user interface
to make it look extra Unicorny.

00:06:42.156 --> 00:06:44.586 A:middle
So that's a very, very high
level of how SiriKit works.

00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:47.536 A:middle
The idea was to make it
incredibly simple to adopt,

00:06:47.926 --> 00:06:49.276 A:middle
but still connect
you to the power

00:06:49.276 --> 00:06:50.516 A:middle
of conversational interactions.

00:06:50.796 --> 00:06:53.266 A:middle
And now to tell you a little bit
more about how that all works,

00:06:53.266 --> 00:06:54.796 A:middle
is my colleague Brandon
Newendorp,

00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:56.726 A:middle
also known to me, as Celestra.

&gt;&gt; Thanks Robby, I
am incredibly excited

00:07:06.206 --> 00:07:09.326 A:middle
to tell you all a little bit
more about how SiriKit works,

00:07:09.676 --> 00:07:11.916 A:middle
and how you're going to be
speaking Siri's language

00:07:12.156 --> 00:07:14.616 A:middle
when you adopt SiriKit
in your own applications.

00:07:15.096 --> 00:07:17.176 A:middle
Now pay close attention
because this is some seriously

00:07:17.176 --> 00:07:17.916 A:middle
"intents" stuff.

00:07:18.996 --> 00:07:20.956 A:middle
To get started, I want to talk

00:07:20.956 --> 00:07:23.916 A:middle
about how SiriKit
communicates about the world.

00:07:24.466 --> 00:07:27.396 A:middle
At a high level, Siri
thinks about everything

00:07:27.396 --> 00:07:28.666 A:middle
in the idea of a domain.

00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:31.276 A:middle
Where a domain is a
broad category of things

00:07:31.276 --> 00:07:34.066 A:middle
that Siri understands and
knows how to talk about.

00:07:34.656 --> 00:07:37.996 A:middle
For example, things like
messaging, placing VOIP calls,

00:07:38.106 --> 00:07:41.246 A:middle
and sending payments, are
great examples of domains,

00:07:41.476 --> 00:07:43.926 A:middle
and are some of the
domains that we are opening

00:07:43.926 --> 00:07:45.026 A:middle
up with SiriKit this year.

00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:48.296 A:middle
Within a domain,
we have an intent.

00:07:48.816 --> 00:07:50.916 A:middle
Where an intent describes
a known action

00:07:50.916 --> 00:07:54.406 A:middle
that Siri understands, and can
communicate to your application.

00:07:55.096 --> 00:07:57.256 A:middle
Now I'd like to break down
an intent a little bit more

00:07:57.486 --> 00:07:59.656 A:middle
with another example, in
a little bit more detail

00:07:59.656 --> 00:08:01.116 A:middle
than what Robby was
just talking about.

00:07:59.656 --> 00:08:01.116 A:middle
than what Robby was
just talking about.

00:08:02.046 --> 00:08:03.646 A:middle
So in this case, we have
the Unicorn Pay app.

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:06.496 A:middle
Hey Siri, send Buttercup
85 bucks

00:08:06.496 --> 00:08:08.626 A:middle
on Unicorn Pay for
rainbow polish.

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.916 A:middle
Now Siri understands
that this is a request

00:08:12.126 --> 00:08:13.286 A:middle
in the payments domain.

00:08:13.876 --> 00:08:16.076 A:middle
And specifically,
we've recognized

00:08:16.076 --> 00:08:18.196 A:middle
that this is a send
payment intent.

00:08:19.196 --> 00:08:22.226 A:middle
Now every intent has
the idea of parameters.

00:08:22.656 --> 00:08:26.356 A:middle
Where parameters are specific
items that Siri can recognize,

00:08:26.766 --> 00:08:29.516 A:middle
understand, and communicate
to your application.

00:08:29.516 --> 00:08:32.236 A:middle
And there's a lot of parameters
on the send message intent.

00:08:33.275 --> 00:08:35.596 A:middle
We've recognized that
the app is Unicorn Pay,

00:08:35.596 --> 00:08:38.025 A:middle
and that the user is
trying to send the money

00:08:38.025 --> 00:08:39.366 A:middle
to someone named Buttercup.

00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:44.566 A:middle
We've also recognized an amount
of 85, and then Siri is going

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:47.816 A:middle
to be very smart, and recognize
that when the user said "bucks,"

00:08:48.066 --> 00:08:49.696 A:middle
they probably meant US Dollars.

00:08:50.186 --> 00:08:52.616 A:middle
And Siri can use a lot
of powerful capabilities

00:08:52.686 --> 00:08:55.826 A:middle
to understand what we think the
user means in a case like this,

00:08:56.206 --> 00:08:58.206 A:middle
basing it on things like
the user's location,

00:08:58.666 --> 00:09:01.386 A:middle
their Siri locale, and
other information available

00:08:58.666 --> 00:09:01.386 A:middle
their Siri locale, and
other information available

00:09:01.386 --> 00:09:02.116 A:middle
to our system.

00:09:03.056 --> 00:09:05.826 A:middle
And finally, we recognize
that the user is asking

00:09:05.826 --> 00:09:07.976 A:middle
to send a payment
for rainbow polish.

00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:13.286 A:middle
So there's this common language
that we've created for Sirikit,

00:09:13.776 --> 00:09:17.686 A:middle
of intents that describe
actions and intent responses

00:09:17.686 --> 00:09:19.636 A:middle
that are used to
describe results coming

00:09:19.636 --> 00:09:21.926 A:middle
from your application
back to Siri.

00:09:24.256 --> 00:09:26.836 A:middle
So let's talk a little
bit more about an intent.

00:09:27.756 --> 00:09:29.596 A:middle
As I said, an intent
is an action

00:09:29.596 --> 00:09:32.366 A:middle
that we're asking your app
to perform, and something

00:09:32.366 --> 00:09:33.256 A:middle
that we can communicate

00:09:33.256 --> 00:09:35.736 A:middle
about between Apple
and your application.

00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:40.226 A:middle
Every intent will have zero to
many parameters, and it's going

00:09:40.226 --> 00:09:43.766 A:middle
to vary based on the
individual intent and domain,

00:09:43.966 --> 00:09:46.086 A:middle
and what Siri understands
within that domain,

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:49.046 A:middle
and what we think is relevant to
communicate to your application.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:52.476 A:middle
And no matter what, an intent
will always be classified

00:09:52.476 --> 00:09:53.216 A:middle
into a domain.

00:09:53.696 --> 00:09:55.056 A:middle
So this is something
you want to think

00:09:55.056 --> 00:09:57.796 A:middle
about when you're getting
started with adopting SiriKit

00:09:57.986 --> 00:10:00.686 A:middle
in your application, is look
at the domains that are a part

00:09:57.986 --> 00:10:00.686 A:middle
in your application, is look
at the domains that are a part

00:10:00.686 --> 00:10:03.086 A:middle
of SiriKit, and think
about which ones are going

00:10:03.086 --> 00:10:04.976 A:middle
to make the most sense
for your application.

00:10:06.736 --> 00:10:08.996 A:middle
Now we also have
intent responses.

00:10:08.996 --> 00:10:12.646 A:middle
And these are how you tell Siri
about the results of the intent

00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:14.366 A:middle
that your app just performed.

00:10:15.796 --> 00:10:17.266 A:middle
You're always going
to use one of these

00:10:17.266 --> 00:10:18.566 A:middle
to communicate the result

00:10:18.806 --> 00:10:21.816 A:middle
because there's always an intent
response paired with its intent.

00:10:22.946 --> 00:10:25.856 A:middle
Intent responses also can have
parameters attached to them,

00:10:26.296 --> 00:10:29.356 A:middle
which are used to describe
what your app actually did

00:10:29.416 --> 00:10:30.116 A:middle
with that intent.

00:10:30.776 --> 00:10:33.346 A:middle
Sometimes those parameters are
going to be the same as the one

00:10:33.346 --> 00:10:35.526 A:middle
on the intent, and other
times they'll be different

00:10:35.666 --> 00:10:37.416 A:middle
because there's something
that's only communicated

00:10:37.656 --> 00:10:39.306 A:middle
from your app back to Siri.

00:10:40.626 --> 00:10:44.246 A:middle
We also accept a response code
attached to an intent response.

00:10:44.926 --> 00:10:47.926 A:middle
These are used to tell
Siri at a broad level

00:10:47.926 --> 00:10:50.816 A:middle
about whether your app was able
to complete the request or not,

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:54.486 A:middle
and there's default ones,
such as success, or failure,

00:10:54.766 --> 00:10:56.616 A:middle
or failure that requires
an app launch.

00:10:57.096 --> 00:10:59.616 A:middle
Some intents and domains have
more specific error codes.

00:11:00.566 --> 00:11:04.396 A:middle
It's very important that you
tell Siri an accurate response

00:11:04.396 --> 00:11:07.326 A:middle
code back for your application
because we're going to use this

00:11:07.326 --> 00:11:10.156 A:middle
to drive dialogue and make
a better user experience

00:11:10.366 --> 00:11:11.486 A:middle
for all of your users.

00:11:12.846 --> 00:11:15.596 A:middle
Finally, we have an
NSUserActivity attached

00:11:15.596 --> 00:11:16.526 A:middle
to an intent response.

00:11:17.206 --> 00:11:19.556 A:middle
Now if you're already supporting
hand off in your application,

00:11:19.766 --> 00:11:21.426 A:middle
you're familiar with
NSUserActivity.

00:11:22.416 --> 00:11:25.026 A:middle
We use NSUserActivities
to launch your application

00:11:25.216 --> 00:11:28.296 A:middle
if the user needs to leave
the Siri experience and move

00:11:28.296 --> 00:11:29.286 A:middle
onto your application.

00:11:30.096 --> 00:11:34.206 A:middle
Now by default, Siri is going to
generate our own user activity

00:11:34.206 --> 00:11:36.716 A:middle
with the intent and
intent response to give

00:11:36.716 --> 00:11:39.316 A:middle
to your application, so
that you can pick up exactly

00:11:39.316 --> 00:11:40.676 A:middle
where you left off from Siri.

00:11:41.166 --> 00:11:45.186 A:middle
If you'd like to, you can
provide your own user activity,

00:11:45.306 --> 00:11:47.256 A:middle
and populate the
user info dictionary

00:11:47.496 --> 00:11:49.546 A:middle
with information that's
unique to your application.

00:11:49.916 --> 00:11:52.356 A:middle
Just to make sure you create
the best possible experience

00:11:52.356 --> 00:11:55.136 A:middle
when users leave Siri and
move on to your application.

00:11:56.046 --> 00:11:58.836 A:middle
So those are intents,
and intent responses.

00:11:59.316 --> 00:12:02.176 A:middle
They're the fundamental
language that Siri uses to talk

00:11:59.316 --> 00:12:02.176 A:middle
They're the fundamental
language that Siri uses to talk

00:12:02.176 --> 00:12:03.266 A:middle
to your application

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:06.086 A:middle
and understand what your
application was able to perform

00:12:06.346 --> 00:12:06.976 A:middle
on behalf of the user.

00:12:12.296 --> 00:12:15.116 A:middle
The next thing I'd like to
talk about, is how your app

00:12:15.256 --> 00:12:17.796 A:middle
and Siri are going to
communicate about intents.

00:12:18.226 --> 00:12:19.996 A:middle
Now there's three steps
that we're going to ask you

00:12:19.996 --> 00:12:22.406 A:middle
to go through, while
communicating about intents.

00:12:23.106 --> 00:12:24.366 A:middle
The first of those is resolve.

00:12:24.936 --> 00:12:26.016 A:middle
We're going to ask your app

00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:28.476 A:middle
to resolve every
parameter on an intent.

00:12:28.896 --> 00:12:31.396 A:middle
And in fact, we will call
resolve multiple times

00:12:31.616 --> 00:12:34.226 A:middle
for every parameter and
sometimes multiple times

00:12:34.226 --> 00:12:37.516 A:middle
for the same parameter
until you and the user agree

00:12:37.576 --> 00:12:38.656 A:middle
on what they requested.

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:42.866 A:middle
The second step is confirm,
which is a chance for your app

00:12:42.906 --> 00:12:45.206 A:middle
to make sure that it's going to
be able to handle the intent,

00:12:45.546 --> 00:12:47.196 A:middle
and tell us about
the expected outcome.

00:12:48.106 --> 00:12:50.536 A:middle
And finally, most
importantly, is the handle step,

00:12:50.846 --> 00:12:53.646 A:middle
where you perform the specific
action the user asked you to do.

00:12:53.646 --> 00:12:56.976 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit more
about the resolve stages first.

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:01.506 A:middle
The purpose of the
resolve stage,

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:01.506 A:middle
The purpose of the
resolve stage,

00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:05.196 A:middle
is for you to help Siri
understand what the user said,

00:13:05.196 --> 00:13:07.726 A:middle
and more importantly,
what the user meant

00:13:07.946 --> 00:13:10.676 A:middle
when they started asking a
request of your application.

00:13:11.676 --> 00:13:14.006 A:middle
This is also your
app's big opportunity

00:13:14.156 --> 00:13:17.056 A:middle
to influence Siri's behavior
and have some control

00:13:17.056 --> 00:13:19.146 A:middle
over the conversation
that we're having

00:13:19.286 --> 00:13:20.856 A:middle
with the user of
your application.

00:13:22.026 --> 00:13:24.406 A:middle
In order to do that,
your app is going

00:13:24.406 --> 00:13:26.726 A:middle
to provide a resolution
response.

00:13:26.896 --> 00:13:29.426 A:middle
And there's a number of
different resolution responses

00:13:29.696 --> 00:13:32.916 A:middle
for every type of data that
Siri understands, and is going

00:13:32.916 --> 00:13:34.636 A:middle
to ask your app to
help us understand.

00:13:34.636 --> 00:13:36.756 A:middle
So let's go back to our example

00:13:36.846 --> 00:13:39.236 A:middle
with sending Buttercup
some money on Unicorn Pay

00:13:39.236 --> 00:13:40.696 A:middle
for that rainbow polish.

00:13:41.216 --> 00:13:43.786 A:middle
And specifically, I'd
like to go pay attention

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:44.966 A:middle
to the payee field.

00:13:45.486 --> 00:13:48.046 A:middle
This is used to describe
who we are sending money to.

00:13:48.526 --> 00:13:52.316 A:middle
And it's important that
Siri, the user, and your app,

00:13:52.316 --> 00:13:55.496 A:middle
all agree on what the user
meant when they said Buttercup.

00:13:55.546 --> 00:13:59.156 A:middle
Now hopefully, the most
common resolution response

00:13:59.156 --> 00:14:00.916 A:middle
from your app will be success.

00:13:59.156 --> 00:14:00.916 A:middle
from your app will be success.

00:14:01.286 --> 00:14:04.036 A:middle
Which means that you understood
exactly what the user said,

00:14:04.296 --> 00:14:06.686 A:middle
what they specified, and
then you're going to tell us

00:14:06.686 --> 00:14:10.376 A:middle
that you successfully understood
that and provide the object back

00:14:10.376 --> 00:14:12.386 A:middle
to us to tell us
what you resolved to,

00:14:12.386 --> 00:14:13.806 A:middle
what you successfully matched.

00:14:14.016 --> 00:14:15.036 A:middle
In this case, it means

00:14:15.036 --> 00:14:17.956 A:middle
that Unicorn Pay totally
understood who Buttercup was.

00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:22.816 A:middle
Now sometimes, your app is going
to make some smart choices,

00:14:23.186 --> 00:14:24.146 A:middle
but it wants to make sure

00:14:24.146 --> 00:14:26.906 A:middle
that the user really meant what
you think you'd made a smart

00:14:26.906 --> 00:14:27.506 A:middle
choice about.

00:14:27.506 --> 00:14:30.276 A:middle
So we have a confirmation
required option.

00:14:30.746 --> 00:14:32.206 A:middle
This is where you can ask Siri

00:14:32.566 --> 00:14:36.256 A:middle
to have the user double
check your resolution result,

00:14:36.446 --> 00:14:38.366 A:middle
and provide a yes
or a no response.

00:14:38.916 --> 00:14:41.996 A:middle
So in this case, for Unicorn
Pay, Siri's just making sure

00:14:41.996 --> 00:14:43.366 A:middle
that the user meant
Sir Buttercup

00:14:43.366 --> 00:14:43.976 A:middle
when they said Buttercup.

00:14:46.116 --> 00:14:49.276 A:middle
Now there's other times that
your app is going to need

00:14:49.276 --> 00:14:51.836 A:middle
to ask the user to pick from
a short list of options.

00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:54.576 A:middle
And Siri calls this
disambiguation.

00:14:55.056 --> 00:14:57.926 A:middle
If you'd like to ask the user
to pick from a list of options,

00:14:58.066 --> 00:15:00.156 A:middle
we recommend five
to ten at most.

00:14:58.066 --> 00:15:00.156 A:middle
we recommend five
to ten at most.

00:15:00.626 --> 00:15:03.346 A:middle
You can provide a
disambiguation list to Siri.

00:15:03.346 --> 00:15:05.776 A:middle
And then we'll present the
options you told us about.

00:15:06.206 --> 00:15:09.126 A:middle
In the case of this Unicorn Pay
example, we're asking the user

00:15:09.126 --> 00:15:10.536 A:middle
if they meant Sir Buttercup,

00:15:10.656 --> 00:15:13.306 A:middle
Buttercup the Bold,
or Sunrise Buttercup?

00:15:14.016 --> 00:15:16.866 A:middle
Now one of the powerful parts
of Siri, is that we're going

00:15:16.866 --> 00:15:20.036 A:middle
to take care of the interaction
with the user on behalf of you.

00:15:20.036 --> 00:15:21.676 A:middle
You don't have to
worry about this part.

00:15:21.676 --> 00:15:24.986 A:middle
So users can use a
natural way to select one

00:15:24.986 --> 00:15:26.036 A:middle
of these options with Siri.

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:29.586 A:middle
They could tap on an item in the
list, they could speak the name

00:15:29.666 --> 00:15:32.616 A:middle
and say "Sir Buttercup", or
they could just refer to one

00:15:32.616 --> 00:15:34.336 A:middle
and simply say, "the
second one."

00:15:34.806 --> 00:15:37.176 A:middle
And no matter how the user
wants to interact with Siri,

00:15:37.536 --> 00:15:40.126 A:middle
we're going to take care of that
for your application for free.

00:15:41.506 --> 00:15:44.976 A:middle
Now there's other times that
you need more information

00:15:44.976 --> 00:15:45.626 A:middle
from the user.

00:15:45.726 --> 00:15:47.236 A:middle
Maybe they weren't
specific enough,

00:15:47.506 --> 00:15:50.426 A:middle
or maybe your application has
80 people named Buttercup,

00:15:50.656 --> 00:15:52.276 A:middle
and you don't want
to present 80 options

00:15:52.276 --> 00:15:53.426 A:middle
of Buttercup to the user.

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:56.676 A:middle
In these cases, you can say
that you need more details,

00:15:57.076 --> 00:15:59.746 A:middle
and Siri will prompt the
user to be more specific.

00:16:00.236 --> 00:16:01.746 A:middle
Once the user provides
more input,

00:16:02.036 --> 00:16:03.546 A:middle
we'll call the resolve
method again.

00:16:03.786 --> 00:16:08.896 A:middle
If the user didn't specify a
value, and you need one in order

00:16:08.896 --> 00:16:11.266 A:middle
to proceed, you can tell
Siri that you need a value.

00:16:11.716 --> 00:16:13.676 A:middle
And in this case, we'll
tell the user, "Hey,

00:16:13.846 --> 00:16:15.776 A:middle
you've got to say something
for this because, you know,

00:16:15.776 --> 00:16:17.796 A:middle
Unicorn Pay needs to know
who you're sending money to."

00:16:19.686 --> 00:16:22.706 A:middle
You can also tell us that you
don't understand the input the

00:16:22.706 --> 00:16:25.576 A:middle
user provided, and that you
need a completely new value.

00:16:26.126 --> 00:16:28.006 A:middle
And for that we have
unsupported with reason.

00:16:28.266 --> 00:16:31.046 A:middle
And just tell us, you don't
support this particular value,

00:16:31.306 --> 00:16:33.156 A:middle
and Siri will ask the
user for a new one.

00:16:34.236 --> 00:16:38.236 A:middle
And finally, if there's a value
that if a parameter is given,

00:16:38.236 --> 00:16:41.646 A:middle
and your app doesn't require it,
or need it, just tell Siri that.

00:16:41.986 --> 00:16:44.676 A:middle
We won't prompt the user for
it, and if the user happens

00:16:44.676 --> 00:16:47.116 A:middle
to specify a value,
we'll simply ignore them.

00:16:47.156 --> 00:16:50.326 A:middle
So those are the resolve steps.

00:16:50.556 --> 00:16:54.496 A:middle
It's how we make sure that
Siri, your app, and the user,

00:16:54.606 --> 00:16:57.106 A:middle
all agree on what they're
asking your application

00:16:57.106 --> 00:16:58.686 A:middle
to do before we move on.

00:17:00.006 --> 00:17:01.706 A:middle
The next step is confirm.

00:17:02.136 --> 00:17:06.046 A:middle
So the confirm stage is
really about two things.

00:17:06.766 --> 00:17:09.346 A:middle
First, it's a chance
for you to tell Siri

00:17:09.496 --> 00:17:12.356 A:middle
about the expected result
of handling an intent.

00:17:12.935 --> 00:17:14.786 A:middle
We will want you to
provide this response

00:17:14.786 --> 00:17:17.226 A:middle
that we can tell the user
what's going to happen.

00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:20.556 A:middle
It's also an opportunity
for your app

00:17:20.556 --> 00:17:23.665 A:middle
to check any required state
that it might need in order

00:17:23.665 --> 00:17:26.116 A:middle
to complete the request
that the user is asking for.

00:17:27.876 --> 00:17:29.416 A:middle
Now no matter what, you're going

00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:32.616 A:middle
to provide an intent response
back from the confirm step,

00:17:32.976 --> 00:17:35.746 A:middle
and we want you to populate as
much information as you can,

00:17:36.146 --> 00:17:38.706 A:middle
in that intent response,
so that we can communicate

00:17:38.706 --> 00:17:40.556 A:middle
that to the user
very effectively.

00:17:41.346 --> 00:17:45.056 A:middle
And sometimes, Siri is going to
prompt the user for confirmation

00:17:45.056 --> 00:17:48.156 A:middle
for certain intents and certain
domains where we've decided

00:17:48.156 --> 00:17:49.026 A:middle
that that's important.

00:17:49.256 --> 00:17:52.786 A:middle
For example, things like sending
payments, or requesting rides,

00:17:53.136 --> 00:17:54.756 A:middle
are things that Siri's
going to confirm

00:17:54.756 --> 00:17:57.406 A:middle
with the user before we
move onto the next step.

00:17:58.336 --> 00:18:00.006 A:middle
So let's think about what
we're going to confirm

00:17:58.336 --> 00:18:00.006 A:middle
So let's think about what
we're going to confirm

00:18:00.236 --> 00:18:01.526 A:middle
in the Unicorn Pay example.

00:18:02.136 --> 00:18:04.566 A:middle
Now Unicorn Pay has to be
able to talk to our service,

00:18:04.906 --> 00:18:07.636 A:middle
make sure the user signed in,
and a number of other things

00:18:07.636 --> 00:18:08.896 A:middle
in order to complete a request.

00:18:09.426 --> 00:18:11.916 A:middle
So we're going to check all
of those in the confirm step.

00:18:12.506 --> 00:18:15.156 A:middle
We're going to say, "Can we
reach the Unicorn Pay servers?

00:18:16.056 --> 00:18:17.756 A:middle
Is the user signed
in to Unicorn Pay?"

00:18:18.386 --> 00:18:21.056 A:middle
And of course, this is
expensive rainbow polish,

00:18:21.156 --> 00:18:22.806 A:middle
so we want to make sure
the user has enough money

00:18:22.806 --> 00:18:24.766 A:middle
in their account before
we send this payment.

00:18:25.486 --> 00:18:27.706 A:middle
Once we've made sure
that our app is able

00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:30.856 A:middle
to handle this request, we
generate an intent response

00:18:31.336 --> 00:18:34.346 A:middle
with a success result code,
and then pass it back to Siri

00:18:34.716 --> 00:18:36.126 A:middle
so we can move onto
the final step.

00:18:37.006 --> 00:18:40.466 A:middle
And that's the confirm stage
of dealing with an intent.

00:18:42.146 --> 00:18:43.606 A:middle
The final step is handle.

00:18:44.126 --> 00:18:47.216 A:middle
And this is the most important
part of working with an intent,

00:18:47.636 --> 00:18:49.856 A:middle
because at this point,
you're going to do the thing

00:18:49.856 --> 00:18:51.066 A:middle
that the user asked you to do.

00:18:51.306 --> 00:18:53.596 A:middle
You're going to perform the
action on behalf of the user.

00:18:54.576 --> 00:18:56.986 A:middle
And just like in the
confirm step, it's important

00:18:56.986 --> 00:18:58.876 A:middle
that you provide
as much information

00:18:58.876 --> 00:19:02.286 A:middle
as you have available back
to Siri, because we want all

00:18:58.876 --> 00:19:02.286 A:middle
as you have available back
to Siri, because we want all

00:19:02.286 --> 00:19:05.636 A:middle
of that information so that we
can create the best possible

00:19:05.636 --> 00:19:08.166 A:middle
user experience for all
of your app's users.

00:19:08.666 --> 00:19:10.946 A:middle
Sometimes we're going to display
this information visually,

00:19:11.516 --> 00:19:13.596 A:middle
and other times we're
going to use it as part

00:19:13.596 --> 00:19:15.966 A:middle
of the conversation and
speak it back to the user,

00:19:16.026 --> 00:19:17.916 A:middle
so that they understand
what your app did.

00:19:20.006 --> 00:19:23.646 A:middle
Now we understand that sometimes
your app might need a little bit

00:19:23.646 --> 00:19:26.346 A:middle
of time to complete a
request on behalf of the user.

00:19:26.716 --> 00:19:29.676 A:middle
Networking calls might take a
while, or maybe there's a human

00:19:29.676 --> 00:19:31.466 A:middle
on the other end of your
service that's, you know,

00:19:31.466 --> 00:19:33.126 A:middle
processing transactions
or something.

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:37.356 A:middle
While we're waiting for a
response back from your app,

00:19:37.496 --> 00:19:39.776 A:middle
were going to show a
waiting UI to the user,

00:19:39.906 --> 00:19:42.056 A:middle
and say that your app
is currently handling

00:19:42.176 --> 00:19:43.006 A:middle
their request.

00:19:43.996 --> 00:19:46.226 A:middle
We really would like you
to provide a response

00:19:46.356 --> 00:19:48.936 A:middle
within a few seconds, two
to three seconds at most.

00:19:49.576 --> 00:19:52.236 A:middle
And ideally, you can get
back to us with a success

00:19:52.236 --> 00:19:53.566 A:middle
in a very short amount of time.

00:19:54.576 --> 00:19:56.746 A:middle
However, if you know
that your app is going

00:19:56.746 --> 00:19:59.396 A:middle
to take a little while to get
back to the user with a result,

00:19:59.956 --> 00:20:02.576 A:middle
we'd like you to send an
in progress response code.

00:19:59.956 --> 00:20:02.576 A:middle
we'd like you to send an
in progress response code.

00:20:03.186 --> 00:20:05.176 A:middle
This allows Siri
to tell the user

00:20:05.176 --> 00:20:08.446 A:middle
that your app has received the
request with as much information

00:20:08.446 --> 00:20:10.816 A:middle
as you've told us about, and
that it's going to continue

00:20:10.816 --> 00:20:13.566 A:middle
to process the request
even if they leave Siri.

00:20:14.736 --> 00:20:16.726 A:middle
So in the case of our
Unicorn Pay example,

00:20:17.486 --> 00:20:19.906 A:middle
as soon as we get the handle
step, we're going to talk

00:20:19.906 --> 00:20:21.996 A:middle
to our servers, we're
going to send the payment,

00:20:22.366 --> 00:20:25.466 A:middle
and then give Siri an intent
response with a success code

00:20:25.466 --> 00:20:28.286 A:middle
so that Siri can tell the
user their money is safely

00:20:28.286 --> 00:20:28.806 A:middle
on the way.

00:20:30.546 --> 00:20:32.986 A:middle
And that's what involved
in how we talk

00:20:32.986 --> 00:20:34.926 A:middle
to your application
with SiriKit.

00:20:35.286 --> 00:20:37.396 A:middle
We have intents,
and intent responses

00:20:37.446 --> 00:20:39.216 A:middle
that are creating
this common language

00:20:39.396 --> 00:20:41.326 A:middle
between your app and Siri.

00:20:42.316 --> 00:20:44.736 A:middle
The next thing we're going to
talk about is what's involved

00:20:44.736 --> 00:20:45.976 A:middle
in adding SiriKit
to your application.

00:20:51.046 --> 00:20:52.656 A:middle
So with SiriKit in iOS 10,

00:20:53.016 --> 00:20:54.966 A:middle
we're creating two
new extension points.

00:20:55.476 --> 00:20:58.626 A:middle
An intents extension, and
an intents UI extension.

00:20:58.816 --> 00:21:01.616 A:middle
I told you this was
some intents stuff.

00:20:58.816 --> 00:21:01.616 A:middle
I told you this was
some intents stuff.

00:21:01.746 --> 00:21:03.526 A:middle
We also are adding some API

00:21:03.526 --> 00:21:07.776 A:middle
to help you help Siri recognize
what the user is saying

00:21:07.856 --> 00:21:08.766 A:middle
for your application.

00:21:09.346 --> 00:21:10.496 A:middle
And we're going that in form

00:21:10.496 --> 00:21:13.936 A:middle
of what we call app
vocabulary, and user vocabulary.

00:21:14.956 --> 00:21:16.586 A:middle
I'd like to get started
by talking

00:21:16.586 --> 00:21:18.376 A:middle
about the intents extension.

00:21:19.256 --> 00:21:21.936 A:middle
This is what's going to
implement the resolve, confirm,

00:21:21.936 --> 00:21:25.356 A:middle
and handle methods that we
were just talking about.

00:21:25.496 --> 00:21:29.456 A:middle
Now, at its core, the intents
extension is the most important

00:21:29.646 --> 00:21:31.166 A:middle
fundamental part of SiriKit.

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:33.616 A:middle
This is what we build all
of our interactions off

00:21:33.616 --> 00:21:36.246 A:middle
of between Siri and
your application.

00:21:37.386 --> 00:21:41.086 A:middle
Your intents extension can
support one or more intents,

00:21:41.496 --> 00:21:43.936 A:middle
and we leave it up to you to
decide what makes the most sense

00:21:43.936 --> 00:21:46.886 A:middle
for your app and how you'd like
to implement your extensions.

00:21:47.276 --> 00:21:49.666 A:middle
Now we encourage you to minimize
the number of extensions

00:21:49.666 --> 00:21:51.886 A:middle
so that we aren't
launching as many processes

00:21:51.886 --> 00:21:54.426 A:middle
if the user makes multiple
requests to your application.

00:21:54.956 --> 00:21:56.496 A:middle
But do what makes sense for you.

00:21:57.866 --> 00:21:59.436 A:middle
It's also important to realize,

00:21:59.556 --> 00:22:01.536 A:middle
that your intent
extension is going to run

00:21:59.556 --> 00:22:01.536 A:middle
that your intent
extension is going to run

00:22:01.596 --> 00:22:04.156 A:middle
in the background while
Siri is in the foreground.

00:22:04.816 --> 00:22:07.906 A:middle
This allows Siri to maintain
a conversation with the user,

00:22:08.276 --> 00:22:10.756 A:middle
and still talk to your app
to get data back and forth

00:22:10.846 --> 00:22:13.326 A:middle
and communicate about
the user's request.

00:22:14.526 --> 00:22:17.766 A:middle
And as I mentioned, your intent
extension is what's implementing

00:22:17.766 --> 00:22:21.486 A:middle
the resolve, confirm, and
handle methods for every intent

00:22:21.486 --> 00:22:22.736 A:middle
that your app supports.

00:22:24.356 --> 00:22:27.866 A:middle
Now when we built SiriKit, we
put a lot of time into thinking

00:22:27.866 --> 00:22:30.236 A:middle
about security, because
security is fundamental

00:22:30.236 --> 00:22:31.856 A:middle
to everything we do at Apple.

00:22:33.106 --> 00:22:35.666 A:middle
Part of Siri's built in
behavior is that we're going

00:22:35.666 --> 00:22:37.396 A:middle
to restrict certain behaviors

00:22:37.396 --> 00:22:40.446 A:middle
from being taken while
the device is locked.

00:22:40.856 --> 00:22:44.026 A:middle
For example, we wanted to
make sure users authenticate

00:22:44.026 --> 00:22:46.636 A:middle
into their device and unlock
it before they send a payment

00:22:46.986 --> 00:22:48.466 A:middle
or request a ridesharing
vehicle.

00:22:49.266 --> 00:22:52.536 A:middle
And that's a built in behavior
we have for certain intents.

00:22:53.226 --> 00:22:55.716 A:middle
Now we also understand that
there are some behaviors

00:22:55.716 --> 00:22:58.456 A:middle
that your app would like to
increase that security for.

00:22:59.306 --> 00:23:01.366 A:middle
By default, Siri's
going to allow things

00:22:59.306 --> 00:23:01.366 A:middle
By default, Siri's
going to allow things

00:23:01.366 --> 00:23:03.016 A:middle
like sending messages
from the lock screen,

00:23:03.356 --> 00:23:06.126 A:middle
but if your app would like to
ensure that the user has logged

00:23:06.126 --> 00:23:08.696 A:middle
into their device first, you
can tell Siri that you would

00:23:08.696 --> 00:23:10.866 A:middle
like to increase our
default security,

00:23:11.176 --> 00:23:13.366 A:middle
and restrict your
intent while locked.

00:23:13.786 --> 00:23:17.206 A:middle
And this is simply done
through an info plist key.

00:23:17.416 --> 00:23:18.826 A:middle
We've also worked to make sure

00:23:18.826 --> 00:23:21.076 A:middle
that the local authentication
framework is available

00:23:21.076 --> 00:23:24.056 A:middle
for your intent extension,
so that you can ask the user

00:23:24.056 --> 00:23:25.556 A:middle
for additional authentication,

00:23:25.956 --> 00:23:27.906 A:middle
even while the device
is already unlocked.

00:23:28.426 --> 00:23:30.766 A:middle
If you're not familiar with the
local authentication framework,

00:23:31.046 --> 00:23:33.846 A:middle
there's a great talk from 2014
that goes into more detail.

00:23:34.976 --> 00:23:38.336 A:middle
And finally, we've made sure
that Apple Pay is available

00:23:38.336 --> 00:23:39.456 A:middle
for your intent extension.

00:23:39.786 --> 00:23:42.506 A:middle
So if you'd like to complete
a transaction using Apple Pay

00:23:42.506 --> 00:23:44.196 A:middle
with your users,
that's available

00:23:44.196 --> 00:23:46.886 A:middle
to your intent extension and
the Apple Pay sheet will appear

00:23:47.096 --> 00:23:47.966 A:middle
right above Siri.

00:23:47.966 --> 00:23:50.126 A:middle
If you'd like to
learn more about this,

00:23:50.296 --> 00:23:51.836 A:middle
I'm glad someone
uses Apply Pay here.

00:23:51.996 --> 00:23:54.286 A:middle
I'm excited about it.

00:23:54.286 --> 00:23:56.136 A:middle
You can learn more in the
What's New with Wallet

00:23:56.136 --> 00:23:58.436 A:middle
and Apple Pay talk that
just took place yesterday.

00:23:59.476 --> 00:24:01.216 A:middle
So that's your intent extension.

00:23:59.476 --> 00:24:01.216 A:middle
So that's your intent extension.

00:24:01.806 --> 00:24:04.586 A:middle
This is a fundamental part of
SiriKit and it's how we're going

00:24:04.586 --> 00:24:08.026 A:middle
to communicate with your app
to complete the users request.

00:24:09.246 --> 00:24:12.096 A:middle
The next piece is your
intents UI extension.

00:24:12.096 --> 00:24:13.946 A:middle
Let's go into a little
bit more detail

00:24:14.126 --> 00:24:15.306 A:middle
about what that's all about.

00:24:15.306 --> 00:24:19.836 A:middle
So the intents UI intent
extension is a chance

00:24:19.836 --> 00:24:22.676 A:middle
to bring your app's interface
into the Siri experience,

00:24:22.896 --> 00:24:24.576 A:middle
and make Siri really feel

00:24:24.576 --> 00:24:27.376 A:middle
like your users are
using your application.

00:24:27.756 --> 00:24:29.986 A:middle
You can bring your brand,
your visual identity,

00:24:29.986 --> 00:24:33.076 A:middle
as well as other information
into the Siri transcript.

00:24:33.706 --> 00:24:35.186 A:middle
And you do that by
adding these views

00:24:35.186 --> 00:24:36.706 A:middle
to what we call a Siri snippet.

00:24:38.056 --> 00:24:40.156 A:middle
Your intents UI extension
is always going

00:24:40.156 --> 00:24:42.056 A:middle
to return a UI view controller.

00:24:42.346 --> 00:24:43.546 A:middle
And you can add anything you'd

00:24:43.546 --> 00:24:44.986 A:middle
like inside that
view controller.

00:24:45.796 --> 00:24:48.816 A:middle
Now it's completely optional to
have an intents UI extension.

00:24:49.356 --> 00:24:52.716 A:middle
By default, Siri has an
interface for every intent

00:24:52.896 --> 00:24:54.466 A:middle
that we support in SiriKit.

00:24:54.586 --> 00:24:57.456 A:middle
And we think that those will
effectively communicate all

00:24:57.456 --> 00:25:00.066 A:middle
of the pieces of information
your user wants to know about,

00:24:57.456 --> 00:25:00.066 A:middle
of the pieces of information
your user wants to know about,

00:25:00.386 --> 00:25:03.226 A:middle
but if you'd like to make a more
unique and branded experience,

00:25:03.606 --> 00:25:04.676 A:middle
this is your opportunity.

00:25:05.926 --> 00:25:08.866 A:middle
We've also made intents
UI extensions available

00:25:08.866 --> 00:25:09.846 A:middle
for certain intents.

00:25:10.166 --> 00:25:13.066 A:middle
Where we think it makes sense to
show an interface to the user.

00:25:13.436 --> 00:25:15.776 A:middle
So there's a number
of things you can do

00:25:15.776 --> 00:25:17.146 A:middle
with an intents UI extension.

00:25:17.806 --> 00:25:20.366 A:middle
You've used it to show
additional information that goes

00:25:20.366 --> 00:25:21.986 A:middle
above and beyond
what's described

00:25:21.986 --> 00:25:24.026 A:middle
in the intent and
intent response.

00:25:24.386 --> 00:25:26.696 A:middle
Maybe some information that's
unique to your application.

00:25:27.966 --> 00:25:31.216 A:middle
You can also use it to update
the user with the status

00:25:31.216 --> 00:25:32.466 A:middle
of a long running intent.

00:25:32.766 --> 00:25:35.166 A:middle
So if you've provided an
in progress response code,

00:25:35.336 --> 00:25:37.576 A:middle
as we mentioned earlier,
you could continue

00:25:37.576 --> 00:25:40.876 A:middle
to update the user about
the status of that intent

00:25:41.176 --> 00:25:42.896 A:middle
in your intents UI extension.

00:25:44.086 --> 00:25:45.946 A:middle
Now no matter what,
we're always going

00:25:45.946 --> 00:25:49.306 A:middle
to show your intents UI
extension alongside other

00:25:49.306 --> 00:25:50.056 A:middle
Siri content.

00:25:50.456 --> 00:25:52.726 A:middle
So we're always going to
show what your app icon

00:25:52.916 --> 00:25:54.646 A:middle
and app name at the
top in a sash.

00:25:55.106 --> 00:25:57.576 A:middle
We may choose to show some
buttons and other information

00:25:57.576 --> 00:25:58.606 A:middle
at the bottom of the snippet,

00:25:58.606 --> 00:26:00.966 A:middle
as well as other
pieces of information.

00:25:58.606 --> 00:26:00.966 A:middle
as well as other
pieces of information.

00:26:01.446 --> 00:26:04.586 A:middle
Your view controller is always
part of our Siri snippet.

00:26:06.436 --> 00:26:08.836 A:middle
Now there's a couple of
cases where it makes sense

00:26:08.836 --> 00:26:11.116 A:middle
for your app to replace
the content

00:26:11.116 --> 00:26:12.646 A:middle
that we're showing
in Siri by default.

00:26:13.246 --> 00:26:16.636 A:middle
And this is things like
messages, or maps, where we felt

00:26:16.636 --> 00:26:18.226 A:middle
that you should have
the opportunity

00:26:18.456 --> 00:26:21.876 A:middle
to replace the default messaging
or maps experience with the one

00:26:21.876 --> 00:26:24.556 A:middle
that you feel suits your
app and your users best.

00:26:24.956 --> 00:26:27.936 A:middle
So you can tell us that your
displaying a map or a message

00:26:27.986 --> 00:26:29.336 A:middle
with your intents UI extension,

00:26:29.376 --> 00:26:32.216 A:middle
and then we will omit certain
Siri interface elements

00:26:32.456 --> 00:26:33.426 A:middle
in favor of yours.

00:26:34.316 --> 00:26:36.546 A:middle
Now it's also important
to keep in mind,

00:26:36.776 --> 00:26:39.446 A:middle
that just like the new
notifications extensions,

00:26:39.906 --> 00:26:42.276 A:middle
intent UI extensions
are non-interactive.

00:26:42.886 --> 00:26:45.486 A:middle
So you can draw anything you'd
like, you can put animations,

00:26:45.486 --> 00:26:47.456 A:middle
you can play any kind
of views you would like,

00:26:47.986 --> 00:26:50.686 A:middle
but we would discourage
you from putting controls

00:26:50.876 --> 00:26:53.236 A:middle
in your UI extension,
because users will not be able

00:26:53.236 --> 00:26:54.056 A:middle
to interact with them.

00:26:54.096 --> 00:26:57.446 A:middle
So that's the intents
UI extension.

00:26:58.086 --> 00:27:01.346 A:middle
Together these two extension
points are everything you need

00:26:58.086 --> 00:27:01.346 A:middle
Together these two extension
points are everything you need

00:27:01.636 --> 00:27:03.786 A:middle
to add your app's
capabilities to Siri,

00:27:03.946 --> 00:27:07.596 A:middle
and bring your experience and
your user interface inside Siri

00:27:07.856 --> 00:27:09.956 A:middle
to make a better experience
for all of your users.

00:27:11.306 --> 00:27:12.756 A:middle
The next two parts of SiriKit,

00:27:13.076 --> 00:27:14.586 A:middle
are all part of your
application.

00:27:15.146 --> 00:27:16.976 A:middle
So let's talk about what
those all involve next.

00:27:22.436 --> 00:27:25.346 A:middle
Now, all of the responsibilities
for your application lie

00:27:25.346 --> 00:27:26.926 A:middle
in the area of vocabulary.

00:27:28.246 --> 00:27:31.166 A:middle
All of your applications
have unique ways of talking

00:27:31.166 --> 00:27:33.756 A:middle
to your customers, and that
your customers use to refer

00:27:33.756 --> 00:27:35.346 A:middle
to features of your application.

00:27:36.196 --> 00:27:37.956 A:middle
And Siri needs a
little bit of your help

00:27:38.336 --> 00:27:40.656 A:middle
in understanding the things
that users are going to say

00:27:40.656 --> 00:27:42.096 A:middle
to your app, and the things

00:27:42.096 --> 00:27:43.696 A:middle
that they're accustomed
to talking about.

00:27:44.586 --> 00:27:47.256 A:middle
Some of these phrases are
part of your application.

00:27:47.256 --> 00:27:48.666 A:middle
They're things that every user

00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:50.706 A:middle
of your app knows
and understands.

00:27:51.556 --> 00:27:54.566 A:middle
Other phrases are going to be
unique to individual users,

00:27:54.696 --> 00:27:56.906 A:middle
and we have the API to
support both of these as part

00:27:56.906 --> 00:27:59.076 A:middle
of SiriKit, and both
are very important

00:27:59.346 --> 00:28:00.866 A:middle
to making a great experience.

00:27:59.346 --> 00:28:00.866 A:middle
to making a great experience.

00:28:02.076 --> 00:28:04.606 A:middle
Let's dig into app
specific vocabulary first.

00:28:05.196 --> 00:28:08.116 A:middle
These are words or phrases that
are part of your application,

00:28:08.116 --> 00:28:11.306 A:middle
and they're known to every
user of your application.

00:28:11.766 --> 00:28:14.076 A:middle
They're things like workout
names or vehicle types

00:28:14.076 --> 00:28:17.546 A:middle
that everyone uses to refer to
certain features of your app.

00:28:17.546 --> 00:28:21.396 A:middle
Now because they're part of your
application, you define these

00:28:21.396 --> 00:28:24.186 A:middle
in a plist that's part
of your main app bundle.

00:28:24.986 --> 00:28:27.006 A:middle
And also, because they're
part of your main app bundle,

00:28:27.476 --> 00:28:28.986 A:middle
we encourage you
to localize these,

00:28:28.986 --> 00:28:31.286 A:middle
so that they can be
supported for every locale

00:28:31.286 --> 00:28:33.596 A:middle
that your app supports,
and every locale

00:28:33.736 --> 00:28:35.036 A:middle
that Siri's going to be using.

00:28:36.736 --> 00:28:38.916 A:middle
Let's talk about what goes
into that vocabulary plist,

00:28:38.916 --> 00:28:41.916 A:middle
because there's a number of
parts to a vocabulary plist.

00:28:43.086 --> 00:28:46.246 A:middle
The first of them, are
examples of how users are going

00:28:46.246 --> 00:28:47.646 A:middle
to talk to your application.

00:28:48.366 --> 00:28:49.666 A:middle
These are kind of
what we call, like,

00:28:49.666 --> 00:28:51.296 A:middle
your hero use cases
for your app.

00:28:51.666 --> 00:28:55.226 A:middle
In the case of our new Unicorn
Fit app, it'd be an example

00:28:55.256 --> 00:28:57.136 A:middle
like start a workout
with Unicorn Fit.

00:28:57.706 --> 00:28:59.756 A:middle
The common things that
you think users will say

00:29:00.056 --> 00:29:00.866 A:middle
to talk to your app.

00:29:02.006 --> 00:29:04.656 A:middle
Now in addition to that,
there are certain parameters

00:29:04.836 --> 00:29:07.016 A:middle
where you can provide
your own vocabulary types.

00:29:07.016 --> 00:29:09.456 A:middle
For the Unicorn Fit application,

00:29:09.736 --> 00:29:12.496 A:middle
we're going to specify our
own unique workout names.

00:29:12.786 --> 00:29:16.416 A:middle
Some things that are unique
and unique to Unicorn Fit,

00:29:16.656 --> 00:29:18.166 A:middle
but known to all of our users.

00:29:18.866 --> 00:29:22.196 A:middle
Now I'm sure you all are very
avid users of Unicorn Fit,

00:29:22.196 --> 00:29:24.266 A:middle
but if you're not, now
we're going to learn

00:29:24.266 --> 00:29:25.666 A:middle
about the term Colorlicious.

00:29:26.046 --> 00:29:28.736 A:middle
It's a particular workout
name, and it describes a thing

00:29:28.736 --> 00:29:29.806 A:middle
where you run around
and you catch bits

00:29:29.806 --> 00:29:31.496 A:middle
of falling glitter
as fast as possible.

00:29:31.496 --> 00:29:32.266 A:middle
It's a great workout.

00:29:32.466 --> 00:29:33.296 A:middle
You should all give it a try.

00:29:33.536 --> 00:29:34.216 A:middle
It's a new craze.

00:29:35.216 --> 00:29:37.946 A:middle
So we're going to tell Siri
about the phrase "Colorlicious."

00:29:37.946 --> 00:29:39.846 A:middle
It's a unique term for our app.

00:29:40.556 --> 00:29:43.466 A:middle
Now, sometimes these phrases
are not the easiest things

00:29:43.466 --> 00:29:43.976 A:middle
to pronounce.

00:29:43.976 --> 00:29:45.726 A:middle
They don't look very obvious.

00:29:46.436 --> 00:29:48.346 A:middle
So you're also going
to give Siri some

00:29:48.346 --> 00:29:49.646 A:middle
pronunciation information.

00:29:50.086 --> 00:29:53.296 A:middle
And this is just a simple
phonetics spelling of the word

00:29:53.296 --> 00:29:55.006 A:middle
or phrase that you're
telling Siri about.

00:29:56.096 --> 00:29:58.916 A:middle
And finally, provide some
examples of how you're going

00:29:58.916 --> 00:29:59.976 A:middle
to use that phrase in your app.

00:30:00.736 --> 00:30:03.396 A:middle
"Do a Colorlicious in Unicorn
Fit", would be an example

00:30:03.396 --> 00:30:05.136 A:middle
of this particular
vocabulary entry.

00:30:07.366 --> 00:30:10.836 A:middle
The other type of vocabulary,
is user specific vocabulary.

00:30:11.516 --> 00:30:13.896 A:middle
These are words or
phrases that are unique

00:30:13.946 --> 00:30:16.296 A:middle
to individual users
of your application.

00:30:17.396 --> 00:30:19.986 A:middle
And because they're unique to
individual users of your app,

00:30:20.366 --> 00:30:22.616 A:middle
we're asking you to
provide them at runtime

00:30:22.776 --> 00:30:24.296 A:middle
from your main application.

00:30:25.266 --> 00:30:27.236 A:middle
We ask you to provide
these in the form

00:30:27.236 --> 00:30:29.526 A:middle
of an ordered set of terms.

00:30:30.256 --> 00:30:32.396 A:middle
Now you might be thinking,
and ordered set is kind

00:30:32.396 --> 00:30:33.796 A:middle
of an odd data structure choice.

00:30:33.796 --> 00:30:35.226 A:middle
Why would we be choosing
to use that?

00:30:35.656 --> 00:30:37.606 A:middle
Well I promise you there's
a really good reason for it.

00:30:38.686 --> 00:30:40.266 A:middle
We really, we really want you --

00:30:40.436 --> 00:30:45.686 A:middle
we'd encourage you to order
the vocabulary in a priority

00:30:45.966 --> 00:30:48.796 A:middle
for your users, with the most
important terms or the things

00:30:48.796 --> 00:30:51.226 A:middle
that you think users will
say the most up front.

00:30:51.996 --> 00:30:54.126 A:middle
Let's talk about that in
the context of Unicorn Pay,

00:30:54.126 --> 00:30:55.446 A:middle
where we have an address book

00:30:55.446 --> 00:30:57.076 A:middle
of everyone we can
send payments to.

00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:01.196 A:middle
Now we want you to give Siri
the names of all of the contacts

00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:01.196 A:middle
Now we want you to give Siri
the names of all of the contacts

00:31:01.196 --> 00:31:03.866 A:middle
in your application, so that
if the user says those names,

00:31:04.136 --> 00:31:05.416 A:middle
we'll be able to recognize them.

00:31:06.386 --> 00:31:09.256 A:middle
However, Unicorn Pay
keeps track of the people

00:31:09.256 --> 00:31:10.746 A:middle
that we've paid most recently.

00:31:11.136 --> 00:31:13.776 A:middle
So we're going to put
our recent contacts ahead

00:31:13.776 --> 00:31:15.696 A:middle
of all the other contacts
in our application.

00:31:16.936 --> 00:31:20.266 A:middle
In addition to that, Unicorn
Pay has a set of favorites,

00:31:20.706 --> 00:31:22.726 A:middle
which are the most
important people to the user.

00:31:23.136 --> 00:31:24.796 A:middle
So we're going to
prioritize those first,

00:31:25.116 --> 00:31:27.336 A:middle
and start off our ordered
set with our favorites,

00:31:27.816 --> 00:31:30.466 A:middle
followed by our recent
contacts, and then wrapping it

00:31:30.466 --> 00:31:32.366 A:middle
up with the other
contacts at the end.

00:31:33.006 --> 00:31:34.566 A:middle
And by prioritizing in this way,

00:31:34.986 --> 00:31:37.946 A:middle
your helping Siri better
understand your users

00:31:38.016 --> 00:31:40.146 A:middle
and make a better
experience for everyone

00:31:40.146 --> 00:31:41.406 A:middle
who uses your app with Siri.

00:31:43.066 --> 00:31:44.956 A:middle
There's a few types of
things that we support

00:31:44.956 --> 00:31:48.066 A:middle
with user vocabulary, and those
are things like contact names,

00:31:48.386 --> 00:31:51.336 A:middle
workout names, photo
albums or photo keywords.

00:31:51.746 --> 00:31:53.976 A:middle
And as an added benefit
to your application,

00:31:54.386 --> 00:31:58.146 A:middle
if you rely on the system iOS
address book, you don't need

00:31:58.146 --> 00:32:00.186 A:middle
to worry about this part
at all for contact names,

00:31:58.146 --> 00:32:00.186 A:middle
to worry about this part
at all for contact names,

00:32:00.316 --> 00:32:02.136 A:middle
because Siri has a
built in understanding

00:32:02.136 --> 00:32:03.206 A:middle
of the system address book.

00:32:03.446 --> 00:32:05.536 A:middle
So you only need to
provide contact names

00:32:05.836 --> 00:32:07.976 A:middle
if your app keeps its own
dedicated address book.

00:32:11.196 --> 00:32:14.636 A:middle
Now, you also should think about
what information you're giving

00:32:14.636 --> 00:32:17.066 A:middle
to Siri as part of this
vocabulary mechanism,

00:32:17.256 --> 00:32:19.076 A:middle
and only tell us
about information

00:32:19.416 --> 00:32:21.356 A:middle
that you your users
would expect Siri

00:32:21.356 --> 00:32:23.026 A:middle
to recognize and know about.

00:32:23.536 --> 00:32:26.046 A:middle
So we don't want you to give
us things like phone numbers,

00:32:26.046 --> 00:32:28.476 A:middle
or e-mail addresses in
your vocabulary data.

00:32:28.786 --> 00:32:32.796 A:middle
Just give us simple common
things like your contact names,

00:32:33.096 --> 00:32:35.746 A:middle
the things that users would
expect to see come from Siri.

00:32:35.746 --> 00:32:39.696 A:middle
Now it's important that
you update Siri promptly

00:32:40.116 --> 00:32:44.116 A:middle
as data changes, because users
are accustomed to saying things

00:32:44.116 --> 00:32:46.536 A:middle
to Siri the instant they
put them into their phone.

00:32:47.086 --> 00:32:49.266 A:middle
So for example, if the
user creates a new contact

00:32:49.266 --> 00:32:51.756 A:middle
in your app, make sure you
tell Siri about that as soon

00:32:51.756 --> 00:32:52.826 A:middle
as they hit the save button.

00:32:53.216 --> 00:32:56.326 A:middle
That way we can ingest the data,
and be ready to recognize it

00:32:56.326 --> 00:32:59.246 A:middle
as soon as users hold down the
home button and talk to Siri.

00:33:00.596 --> 00:33:03.636 A:middle
It's even more important
that you delete information

00:33:03.636 --> 00:33:05.276 A:middle
from your Siri vocabulary
promptly,

00:33:05.676 --> 00:33:07.606 A:middle
because your users
would be very unhappy

00:33:07.866 --> 00:33:09.776 A:middle
if they deleted something
from your application,

00:33:09.986 --> 00:33:12.666 A:middle
and then Siri was still
recognizing it a few days

00:33:12.666 --> 00:33:15.256 A:middle
or a few weeks later, because
you forgot to tell Siri

00:33:15.256 --> 00:33:17.916 A:middle
that the user deleted that
particular piece of information.

00:33:19.196 --> 00:33:21.856 A:middle
And finally, make sure
that you remove all

00:33:21.856 --> 00:33:24.716 A:middle
of your vocabulary data from
Siri if the user chooses

00:33:24.716 --> 00:33:27.156 A:middle
to reset your application,
or log out.

00:33:29.346 --> 00:33:32.386 A:middle
Now the other piece of SiriKit
has to do with permissions.

00:33:33.196 --> 00:33:35.276 A:middle
So like many other parts of iOS,

00:33:35.976 --> 00:33:38.296 A:middle
users have to approve
authorization

00:33:38.296 --> 00:33:39.706 A:middle
for your app to talk to Siri.

00:33:40.206 --> 00:33:42.456 A:middle
And we do this through
the standard TCC alerts

00:33:42.456 --> 00:33:43.656 A:middle
that you're used to
seeing for things

00:33:43.656 --> 00:33:45.496 A:middle
like the camera,
or the microphone.

00:33:46.856 --> 00:33:49.816 A:middle
Now your app is able to
provide a string that goes

00:33:49.816 --> 00:33:52.456 A:middle
into this alert to
tell users what kind

00:33:52.456 --> 00:33:55.086 A:middle
of information your app is
going to be sending to Siri.

00:33:55.656 --> 00:33:59.046 A:middle
This is also a fantastic
opportunity to teach your users

00:33:59.046 --> 00:34:00.196 A:middle
about what your app does,

00:33:59.046 --> 00:34:00.196 A:middle
about what your app does,

00:34:00.376 --> 00:34:02.566 A:middle
and what cool new features
you've just created

00:34:02.566 --> 00:34:04.846 A:middle
for all of them.

00:34:05.036 --> 00:34:08.096 A:middle
We also are encouraging
you to request permission

00:34:08.096 --> 00:34:10.755 A:middle
from your app the first
time a user uses it

00:34:10.755 --> 00:34:12.706 A:middle
after they upgrade to iOS 10.

00:34:13.266 --> 00:34:15.996 A:middle
We want you to do that so
that users know about Siri

00:34:15.996 --> 00:34:17.146 A:middle
and have approved the use

00:34:17.146 --> 00:34:19.706 A:middle
of Siri before they make
their first request.

00:34:19.706 --> 00:34:22.735 A:middle
So as soon as they try talking
to Siri, and your application,

00:34:23.016 --> 00:34:25.216 A:middle
it's already approved, and
they have a fantastic first

00:34:25.216 --> 00:34:25.966 A:middle
launch experience.

00:34:29.156 --> 00:34:30.036 A:middle
So that's what's involved

00:34:30.036 --> 00:34:31.746 A:middle
in adding SiriKit
to your application.

00:34:32.396 --> 00:34:34.775 A:middle
These two pieces of extensions,
these two new extensions,

00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:36.726 A:middle
and two vocabulary mechanisms.

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:43.036 A:middle
The last thing I would like to
talk about is how SiriKit fits

00:34:43.036 --> 00:34:46.216 A:middle
into the larger world of iOS.

00:34:46.406 --> 00:34:48.795 A:middle
Now Siri is an integral part
of our operating system.

00:34:48.966 --> 00:34:52.396 A:middle
It's always accessible to
the user via the home button,

00:34:52.396 --> 00:34:54.976 A:middle
via hey Siri, via
headset microphones

00:34:54.976 --> 00:34:56.795 A:middle
and many other ways
of triggering Siri.

00:34:57.616 --> 00:34:59.666 A:middle
And SiriKit is just as integral

00:34:59.666 --> 00:35:01.726 A:middle
to the operating
system as Siri itself.

00:34:59.666 --> 00:35:01.726 A:middle
to the operating
system as Siri itself.

00:35:02.876 --> 00:35:07.236 A:middle
Now Siri integration is part of
this larger intense framework

00:35:07.236 --> 00:35:09.396 A:middle
that we've created
this year, which is all

00:35:09.396 --> 00:35:13.416 A:middle
about communicating these common
and shared actions and intents

00:35:13.816 --> 00:35:15.986 A:middle
between your app and iOS.

00:35:15.986 --> 00:35:19.536 A:middle
And the intense framework
is going beyond just Siri

00:35:19.536 --> 00:35:20.396 A:middle
integration this year.

00:35:21.226 --> 00:35:22.896 A:middle
It's part of the
contacts integration,

00:35:23.106 --> 00:35:25.226 A:middle
where you can donate
information to the system,

00:35:25.566 --> 00:35:29.016 A:middle
and elevate your application
to be the default messaging

00:35:29.316 --> 00:35:32.086 A:middle
or telephoning mechanism
for certain contacts.

00:35:33.006 --> 00:35:36.196 A:middle
We've also done very deep
integration with CallKit,

00:35:36.456 --> 00:35:38.046 A:middle
to make a great VOIP experience.

00:35:38.586 --> 00:35:41.426 A:middle
The most, the biggest
piece of this is with maps.

00:35:42.296 --> 00:35:45.506 A:middle
Maps is adding ridesharing
to iOS 10,

00:35:45.506 --> 00:35:48.376 A:middle
where you can book a ride right
within the maps application.

00:35:49.146 --> 00:35:51.276 A:middle
Now we worked very
closely with the maps team

00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:53.616 A:middle
to create a common
extension point.

00:35:53.776 --> 00:35:57.406 A:middle
This intense extension and
ridesharing intents are used

00:35:57.406 --> 00:36:01.066 A:middle
for Siri, and maps, to
create the same experience.

00:35:57.406 --> 00:36:01.066 A:middle
for Siri, and maps, to
create the same experience.

00:36:01.456 --> 00:36:05.676 A:middle
So if you adopt SiriKit and the
intents extensions, you're going

00:36:05.676 --> 00:36:07.566 A:middle
to get the maps integration
for free.

00:36:08.516 --> 00:36:10.616 A:middle
We think this is a great
way to save you some time,

00:36:11.126 --> 00:36:13.786 A:middle
and make an even better
developer and user experience.

00:36:15.476 --> 00:36:20.876 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:36:21.376 --> 00:36:23.146 A:middle
The last part I'd
like to talk about,

00:36:23.746 --> 00:36:25.486 A:middle
is how users talk
to your application.

00:36:26.476 --> 00:36:28.496 A:middle
Now it's very important
as part of our security

00:36:28.496 --> 00:36:30.576 A:middle
and privacy model of iOS

00:36:30.576 --> 00:36:33.096 A:middle
and making your customers
comfortable with your app

00:36:33.096 --> 00:36:36.836 A:middle
and your data, it's important
that they understand when a --

00:36:36.836 --> 00:36:39.646 A:middle
they're going to be talking
to your specific application

00:36:39.646 --> 00:36:42.566 A:middle
and when their data
is going to your app.

00:36:42.866 --> 00:36:45.036 A:middle
To make sure that all
of your users know that,

00:36:45.596 --> 00:36:47.976 A:middle
users are required to
say the name of your app

00:36:48.496 --> 00:36:50.116 A:middle
when making a request to Siri.

00:36:50.866 --> 00:36:52.396 A:middle
Specifically, we're
going to be looking

00:36:52.396 --> 00:36:53.676 A:middle
at your bundle display name.

00:36:53.866 --> 00:36:55.456 A:middle
This is what's shown
on the home screen,

00:36:55.516 --> 00:36:57.396 A:middle
underneath your app
icon, to your users.

00:36:58.406 --> 00:37:00.286 A:middle
Now Siri's all about
natural language

00:36:58.406 --> 00:37:00.286 A:middle
Now Siri's all about
natural language

00:37:00.286 --> 00:37:03.646 A:middle
and having a comfortable fluid
conversation with the user.

00:37:04.536 --> 00:37:06.716 A:middle
So to make sure that that's
part of how this works,

00:37:07.126 --> 00:37:10.496 A:middle
users are able to say your app
name in many parts of speech,

00:37:10.496 --> 00:37:13.126 A:middle
at the beginning, or the end
of an utterance, in the middle,

00:37:13.516 --> 00:37:16.426 A:middle
wherever it fits in
naturally, because Siri wants

00:37:16.426 --> 00:37:19.116 A:middle
to make a natural fluid
experience for talking

00:37:19.116 --> 00:37:20.716 A:middle
to your app, and to your users.

00:37:21.656 --> 00:37:24.016 A:middle
One of the common
things that users do

00:37:24.106 --> 00:37:26.886 A:middle
with SiriKit is what we
call verbing the app name,

00:37:27.166 --> 00:37:29.686 A:middle
or taking your app name
and using it as a verb

00:37:29.856 --> 00:37:31.426 A:middle
to describe a particular action.

00:37:31.946 --> 00:37:33.986 A:middle
As an example of
that, they might say,

00:37:34.146 --> 00:37:37.106 A:middle
"Unicorn Chat Celestra order
five rainbow rolls please."

00:37:37.546 --> 00:37:40.666 A:middle
And in this case, they're
using Unicorn Chat as the verb,

00:37:41.066 --> 00:37:43.116 A:middle
describing the action
they're asking us to take.

00:37:43.116 --> 00:37:46.236 A:middle
And this will, of course, work
fantastically well with Siri.

00:37:46.946 --> 00:37:49.676 A:middle
In fact, there's a multitude
of ways that users can talk

00:37:49.676 --> 00:37:51.496 A:middle
to your app using Siri.

00:37:51.986 --> 00:37:53.346 A:middle
The possibilities are endless.

00:37:53.346 --> 00:37:55.356 A:middle
So that's what's involved

00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:59.536 A:middle
in implementing a great Siri
experience for your users.

00:37:59.916 --> 00:38:02.236 A:middle
But there's more than just
engineering implantation

00:37:59.916 --> 00:38:02.236 A:middle
But there's more than just
engineering implantation

00:38:02.416 --> 00:38:05.006 A:middle
involved in creating a
good Siri experience.

00:38:05.446 --> 00:38:06.236 A:middle
And to tell you more

00:38:06.236 --> 00:38:08.036 A:middle
about designing a
great Siri experience,

00:38:08.396 --> 00:38:10.976 A:middle
I'd like to invite Buttercup,
my co-worker Corey, on stage.

00:38:11.516 --> 00:38:15.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:38:16.066 --> 00:38:16.446 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:38:18.616 --> 00:38:19.786 A:middle
Hello everyone.

00:38:19.786 --> 00:38:22.456 A:middle
I'm Corey Peterson, and
I'm a designer on Siri,

00:38:22.836 --> 00:38:25.006 A:middle
and I'm very excited
to talk to you

00:38:25.006 --> 00:38:26.976 A:middle
about creating magical
experiences with SiriKit.

00:38:32.046 --> 00:38:33.826 A:middle
I've got three things I
want to talk about today.

00:38:34.886 --> 00:38:37.566 A:middle
The first is some of the
things that Siri does for you

00:38:37.926 --> 00:38:41.116 A:middle
to help facilitate the
conversation with your users.

00:38:42.266 --> 00:38:45.416 A:middle
Next, we'll go through
some design guidelines

00:38:45.416 --> 00:38:48.306 A:middle
that you should keep in mind as
you start to work with SiriKit.

00:38:49.676 --> 00:38:52.646 A:middle
And then, I'll give a few
tips of what you can do

00:38:52.886 --> 00:38:55.776 A:middle
to polish the design, and take
your app to the next level.

00:38:56.536 --> 00:39:00.436 A:middle
So, let's get started
with user interface.

00:38:56.536 --> 00:39:00.436 A:middle
So, let's get started
with user interface.

00:39:00.966 --> 00:39:04.016 A:middle
Now when I say user interface,
you're probably thinking

00:39:04.306 --> 00:39:05.446 A:middle
about something like this.

00:39:07.286 --> 00:39:10.066 A:middle
A button. Part of
a visual interface

00:39:10.486 --> 00:39:11.506 A:middle
that appears on screen.

00:39:11.976 --> 00:39:15.536 A:middle
Now visual interfaces have
well understood behaviors

00:39:15.536 --> 00:39:16.976 A:middle
and patterns and

00:39:20.096 --> 00:39:22.956 A:middle
and everyone is pretty
familiar with using those.

00:39:23.496 --> 00:39:24.826 A:middle
It's part of an application,

00:39:25.366 --> 00:39:28.116 A:middle
and that application gives the
context of what you're trying --

00:39:28.116 --> 00:39:29.196 A:middle
the user is trying to do,

00:39:30.066 --> 00:39:31.546 A:middle
the options that
they have available,

00:39:31.546 --> 00:39:33.346 A:middle
and the details about
those elements.

00:39:33.916 --> 00:39:36.726 A:middle
And there's pretty much one
way to interact with a button.

00:39:37.716 --> 00:39:42.996 A:middle
But, as you start to work with
conversation things change,

00:39:42.996 --> 00:39:44.866 A:middle
and one of the biggest
differences is

00:39:45.186 --> 00:39:46.996 A:middle
that button is gone.

00:39:48.116 --> 00:39:52.636 A:middle
Now, it can be -- feel
strange not having information

00:39:52.966 --> 00:39:53.466 A:middle
on a screen.

00:39:54.816 --> 00:39:56.496 A:middle
So how do we solve this?

00:39:56.846 --> 00:39:59.186 A:middle
Because the user could
say whatever they want,

00:39:59.746 --> 00:40:01.286 A:middle
or they might not
even know what to say.

00:39:59.746 --> 00:40:01.286 A:middle
or they might not
even know what to say.

00:40:02.316 --> 00:40:05.776 A:middle
So we like to think of it as
a conversational interface.

00:40:06.456 --> 00:40:10.886 A:middle
The context of what's
happening is established

00:40:10.886 --> 00:40:14.206 A:middle
through the conversation
between the person,

00:40:14.946 --> 00:40:17.016 A:middle
Siri, and now your apps.

00:40:18.636 --> 00:40:23.106 A:middle
Now, without a visual reference,
the user, or the person has

00:40:23.106 --> 00:40:24.846 A:middle
to keep all this
information in their head.

00:40:25.506 --> 00:40:27.096 A:middle
So Siri works hard to prevent --

00:40:27.236 --> 00:40:30.616 A:middle
to present just the
relevant critical information

00:40:30.616 --> 00:40:33.986 A:middle
to get a task done, and
not overwhelm them with all

00:40:33.986 --> 00:40:34.926 A:middle
of the other information.

00:40:37.006 --> 00:40:42.376 A:middle
And, this interface is shaped by
the questions and the responses,

00:40:42.726 --> 00:40:44.366 A:middle
both from the person
and from Siri.

00:40:45.036 --> 00:40:46.286 A:middle
And it's important to think

00:40:46.286 --> 00:40:49.516 A:middle
about how Siri asks
and responds.

00:40:49.856 --> 00:40:52.176 A:middle
And your application
has the ability

00:40:53.076 --> 00:40:54.196 A:middle
to shape this conversation.

00:40:54.196 --> 00:40:56.166 A:middle
And we'll talk about
that a little bit later.

00:40:57.136 --> 00:41:00.296 A:middle
So let's go through an
example of how this can work.

00:40:57.136 --> 00:41:00.296 A:middle
So let's go through an
example of how this can work.

00:41:01.066 --> 00:41:03.206 A:middle
Let's say, someone
has created a message,

00:41:04.106 --> 00:41:05.906 A:middle
and Siri might say
something like,

00:41:10.046 --> 00:41:12.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Ready to send it?

00:41:12.986 --> 00:41:15.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now people can say a lot
of different things here.

00:41:16.586 --> 00:41:18.516 A:middle
They might simply say "send it."

00:41:19.536 --> 00:41:20.996 A:middle
Or they might decide not to,

00:41:21.796 --> 00:41:24.176 A:middle
or they might ignore
the question entirely,

00:41:24.686 --> 00:41:27.076 A:middle
and say whatever they want.

00:41:27.076 --> 00:41:28.256 A:middle
And that's okay.

00:41:28.366 --> 00:41:31.136 A:middle
These are actually appropriate
responses in this situation.

00:41:31.896 --> 00:41:34.336 A:middle
And the great thing is, Siri's
going to take care of this

00:41:34.336 --> 00:41:37.826 A:middle
for you, and send the right
information back to your app.

00:41:37.826 --> 00:41:41.076 A:middle
And even better than that,
Siri will handle the thousands

00:41:41.076 --> 00:41:42.976 A:middle
of other ways that people
may say the same thing.

00:41:46.126 --> 00:41:51.886 A:middle
Now earlier, Robby talked
about all the different ways

00:41:51.886 --> 00:41:53.966 A:middle
that people can start a
conversation with Siri,

00:41:53.966 --> 00:41:56.086 A:middle
and I'm going to focus
on a couple of those.

00:41:56.726 --> 00:41:58.856 A:middle
Now everyone's familiar
with picking up your device,

00:41:59.066 --> 00:42:01.646 A:middle
pressing the home button, and
starting the conversation.

00:41:59.066 --> 00:42:01.646 A:middle
pressing the home button, and
starting the conversation.

00:42:02.966 --> 00:42:06.626 A:middle
But, another important mode that
we have is what call hands free,

00:42:06.966 --> 00:42:07.726 A:middle
where you don't have

00:42:07.726 --> 00:42:10.336 A:middle
to physically touch the
device to start talking.

00:42:10.596 --> 00:42:14.846 A:middle
So just by starting your request
with "Hey Siri" you're able

00:42:14.846 --> 00:42:22.016 A:middle
to work from across the room,
or -- or well, across the room,

00:42:22.016 --> 00:42:24.016 A:middle
if your hands are full, or if
you're doing something else.

00:42:26.046 --> 00:42:27.886 A:middle
Let me show you a
couple examples

00:42:28.086 --> 00:42:30.566 A:middle
of how the conversational
interface changes

00:42:31.046 --> 00:42:32.416 A:middle
to adapt to these situations.

00:42:33.446 --> 00:42:36.536 A:middle
So, here, we're going to say
I'm holding onto my phone

00:42:36.536 --> 00:42:37.296 A:middle
and pressing the button.

00:42:38.706 --> 00:42:42.316 A:middle
So I'll say, "Do I
have any reminders?"

00:42:43.776 --> 00:42:45.156 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You have five reminders.

00:42:46.176 --> 00:42:49.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So as you heard, Siri
presented a quick answer,

00:42:49.126 --> 00:42:51.636 A:middle
and then gave visual
information on the screen

00:42:51.636 --> 00:42:53.876 A:middle
since I'm holding it and
I can take a look at that.

00:42:54.846 --> 00:42:57.976 A:middle
Now, listen to how this changes
when I activate hands free.

00:43:02.046 --> 00:43:04.186 A:middle
Hey Siri, do I have
any reminders?

00:43:05.576 --> 00:43:07.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I found five reminders.

00:43:07.636 --> 00:43:12.766 A:middle
The first one is talk about
accessibility, then get Siri

00:43:12.766 --> 00:43:14.646 A:middle
to say hi to people
in Cupertino,

00:43:16.246 --> 00:43:18.026 A:middle
then go to the next slide.

00:43:18.026 --> 00:43:19.936 A:middle
Do you want me to
read you the rest?

00:43:20.586 --> 00:43:21.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; No thanks Siri.

00:43:22.156 --> 00:43:24.786 A:middle
So as you heard, Siri
read out that information

00:43:25.066 --> 00:43:26.766 A:middle
and it gave a smaller amount

00:43:26.766 --> 00:43:29.346 A:middle
of information that's
easier for me to understand.

00:43:29.806 --> 00:43:34.246 A:middle
And at the end, Siri asks me
for the next step so that I'm

00:43:34.246 --> 00:43:37.316 A:middle
in control of the conversation
and what happens next.

00:43:38.306 --> 00:43:41.366 A:middle
Now we use these same principles
in other places as well.

00:43:42.356 --> 00:43:44.896 A:middle
In car play, where you need
to keep your eyes on the road.

00:43:45.056 --> 00:43:50.036 A:middle
And it's also very helpful for
people with accessibility needs.

00:43:50.786 --> 00:43:55.166 A:middle
Now Siri is great because you
can ask for it to perform a task

00:43:55.416 --> 00:43:57.376 A:middle
and its able to do
so, and you don't have

00:43:57.376 --> 00:44:00.736 A:middle
to find an application and
navigate through a visual UI

00:43:57.376 --> 00:44:00.736 A:middle
to find an application and
navigate through a visual UI

00:44:00.736 --> 00:44:03.406 A:middle
to get something done,
but Siri does more.

00:44:04.016 --> 00:44:07.006 A:middle
Siri understands when you have
devices connected, such as a set

00:44:07.006 --> 00:44:09.436 A:middle
of headphones, or a
Bluetooth hearing aid.

00:44:10.426 --> 00:44:13.526 A:middle
And it adapts what it --
oh, and in another case,

00:44:13.526 --> 00:44:15.506 A:middle
it can recognize settings
such as voice over,

00:44:15.906 --> 00:44:17.546 A:middle
which is Apple's
technology for reading

00:44:17.546 --> 00:44:19.256 A:middle
out the visual elements
on screen.

00:44:20.546 --> 00:44:22.756 A:middle
And it again, adapts
its behavior

00:44:22.756 --> 00:44:27.626 A:middle
to help these users
complete their tasks.

00:44:27.626 --> 00:44:30.236 A:middle
So, that's a little bit
about how Siri helps you.

00:44:30.396 --> 00:44:32.646 A:middle
Here's a couple things that
you can do to help Siri.

00:44:34.096 --> 00:44:36.786 A:middle
Make sure that you're testing,
as you develop your apps,

00:44:37.146 --> 00:44:37.976 A:middle
with many different requests.

00:44:40.646 --> 00:44:43.846 A:middle
Testing different
situations, and especially try

00:44:43.846 --> 00:44:45.136 A:middle
out things hands free.

00:44:47.336 --> 00:44:49.066 A:middle
And throughout the process,

00:44:49.276 --> 00:44:52.156 A:middle
make sure that your app is
providing information back

00:44:52.156 --> 00:44:55.386 A:middle
to Siri so that Siri can
represent it back to the person.

00:44:56.456 --> 00:44:59.786 A:middle
And that's especially critical
in these hands free situations.

00:45:01.576 --> 00:45:04.976 A:middle
All right, let's move on
to some design guidelines.

00:45:13.316 --> 00:45:14.886 A:middle
And I want you to think of this

00:45:14.886 --> 00:45:17.176 A:middle
as a conversation
with your users.

00:45:17.746 --> 00:45:19.486 A:middle
And as with any important
conversation,

00:45:19.766 --> 00:45:23.326 A:middle
you need to make sure that
you prepare, that you listen,

00:45:24.456 --> 00:45:28.556 A:middle
that you ask questions, and
that you respond to the request.

00:45:29.386 --> 00:45:31.156 A:middle
So, how do we prepare?

00:45:32.256 --> 00:45:34.456 A:middle
The first thing is to recognize

00:45:35.036 --> 00:45:37.576 A:middle
that your users aren't
exactly like you.

00:45:38.066 --> 00:45:40.076 A:middle
Now, what do I mean by that?

00:45:40.806 --> 00:45:44.026 A:middle
You've spent a huge
amount of time developing

00:45:44.026 --> 00:45:47.406 A:middle
and designing your application,
and you have an amount

00:45:47.406 --> 00:45:50.186 A:middle
of knowledge that's greater
than anyone else will ever have

00:45:50.186 --> 00:45:52.156 A:middle
with it, and that's going

00:45:52.156 --> 00:45:54.006 A:middle
to influence how you
would talk to Siri.

00:45:55.006 --> 00:46:00.216 A:middle
So, you need to go out and find
some real people, maybe friends,

00:45:55.006 --> 00:46:00.216 A:middle
So, you need to go out and find
some real people, maybe friends,

00:46:00.366 --> 00:46:02.846 A:middle
significant others, or maybe
even people in marketing

00:46:03.626 --> 00:46:05.996 A:middle
and ask them what
would you say to Siri?

00:46:08.266 --> 00:46:13.476 A:middle
So I'm going to go with
our theme from today,

00:46:13.476 --> 00:46:17.496 A:middle
and talk about an
application Unicorn Rides.

00:46:18.506 --> 00:46:20.936 A:middle
So for this fake
application, we went and talked

00:46:20.936 --> 00:46:25.166 A:middle
to some real users and they
came back with some responses.

00:46:25.606 --> 00:46:29.116 A:middle
Some people might say "Get
a ride", and in this case,

00:46:29.426 --> 00:46:32.816 A:middle
Siri is going to ask the user
which application they want

00:46:32.816 --> 00:46:37.876 A:middle
to use, and then can continue
through the rest of the task.

00:46:38.046 --> 00:46:39.956 A:middle
Some people may provide
more information,

00:46:40.686 --> 00:46:43.516 A:middle
and some people may provide
a whole lot more information,

00:46:43.996 --> 00:46:45.566 A:middle
some of which may
not be possible,

00:46:46.146 --> 00:46:48.776 A:middle
because as we all know,
it's really hard to fit more

00:46:48.776 --> 00:46:49.976 A:middle
than two people on a Pegasus.

00:46:54.046 --> 00:46:55.536 A:middle
Once you have all
these responses,

00:46:56.996 --> 00:46:59.386 A:middle
make sure that your
app is a good listener.

00:47:00.006 --> 00:47:02.826 A:middle
Take all of the information
that the user has provided

00:47:02.826 --> 00:47:05.666 A:middle
and use that, but they
may not provide all

00:47:05.666 --> 00:47:06.916 A:middle
of the information
that you need.

00:47:07.566 --> 00:47:09.496 A:middle
So, you need to find
ways to get it.

00:47:10.076 --> 00:47:11.886 A:middle
One way, is to pick
a good default,

00:47:12.626 --> 00:47:15.486 A:middle
so if I were requesting
a ride, and I didn't say

00:47:15.486 --> 00:47:18.786 A:middle
where to be picked up, Unicorn
Rides could pick a good default

00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:20.816 A:middle
that I probably want to
be picked up right here,

00:47:21.296 --> 00:47:23.676 A:middle
or maybe outside the
building down by the curb.

00:47:25.496 --> 00:47:28.856 A:middle
You can also make educated
guesses based on your knowledge

00:47:28.856 --> 00:47:33.826 A:middle
about the user, but
avoid bad surprises.

00:47:34.576 --> 00:47:36.616 A:middle
You don't want to pick
the most expensive option,

00:47:36.616 --> 00:47:41.136 A:middle
or some other default, or some
other guess that a user is going

00:47:41.136 --> 00:47:42.236 A:middle
to be unhappy with later.

00:47:43.106 --> 00:47:44.786 A:middle
So if you have questions
and you're not sure

00:47:44.786 --> 00:47:48.376 A:middle
if someone would be unhappy,
maybe the better answer is

00:47:48.376 --> 00:47:50.406 A:middle
to ask the question to the user.

00:47:51.806 --> 00:47:55.096 A:middle
But, with this, you need to
make sure you keep it simple.

00:47:55.626 --> 00:47:58.376 A:middle
Nobody wants to play a game of
20 questions when they're trying

00:47:58.376 --> 00:47:59.126 A:middle
to get something done.

00:47:59.966 --> 00:48:03.886 A:middle
So, only ask for the things
that are absolutely necessary.

00:47:59.966 --> 00:48:03.886 A:middle
So, only ask for the things
that are absolutely necessary.

00:48:04.926 --> 00:48:06.876 A:middle
And people may provide
information

00:48:07.436 --> 00:48:08.566 A:middle
that your app can't handle,

00:48:08.946 --> 00:48:11.656 A:middle
so you need to send
those errors back to Siri

00:48:12.006 --> 00:48:13.716 A:middle
so that Siri can
present it to the user,

00:48:13.866 --> 00:48:18.056 A:middle
and try to move forward
with the task.

00:48:18.056 --> 00:48:22.486 A:middle
There are two types of questions
that I want to go discuss more,

00:48:23.046 --> 00:48:24.456 A:middle
and Brandon talked
about them earlier.

00:48:25.036 --> 00:48:26.236 A:middle
The first is confirmation.

00:48:26.936 --> 00:48:30.686 A:middle
And this is great when you
have one item, that you want

00:48:30.686 --> 00:48:31.556 A:middle
to check with the user.

00:48:32.026 --> 00:48:37.426 A:middle
And this could happen because
you made an educated guess,

00:48:37.546 --> 00:48:41.186 A:middle
or if there's an item that
would have really big impact.

00:48:41.966 --> 00:48:45.266 A:middle
So if someone is used to
making small purchases,

00:48:45.266 --> 00:48:48.676 A:middle
or small payments
with your payment app,

00:48:48.676 --> 00:48:50.966 A:middle
and suddenly they make a payment
that's much, much larger,

00:48:51.166 --> 00:48:52.556 A:middle
you may want to confirm
that with them

00:48:52.716 --> 00:48:53.646 A:middle
to make sure it's
what they meant.

00:48:55.926 --> 00:48:57.616 A:middle
The next is disambiguation.

00:48:58.076 --> 00:49:01.576 A:middle
And this is great when
you have multiple options,

00:48:58.076 --> 00:49:01.576 A:middle
And this is great when
you have multiple options,

00:49:01.716 --> 00:49:02.936 A:middle
and you need the
user to pick one.

00:49:04.066 --> 00:49:07.086 A:middle
So this can be used when
you have a small list,

00:49:07.256 --> 00:49:10.686 A:middle
such as the available ride
types at a given time.

00:49:11.656 --> 00:49:15.376 A:middle
Or, if you have a much
larger list, say I was going

00:49:15.376 --> 00:49:19.516 A:middle
to send a message to Eric,
and I have a number of people

00:49:19.516 --> 00:49:22.016 A:middle
in my contacts, I
can filter that down

00:49:22.286 --> 00:49:24.236 A:middle
to just the possible
matches for Eric,

00:49:24.236 --> 00:49:25.926 A:middle
and let the user pick that.

00:49:26.956 --> 00:49:31.866 A:middle
Siri can present this list both
visually, and through speaking.

00:49:31.866 --> 00:49:35.976 A:middle
And the user can respond by
tapping or saying the response.

00:49:39.546 --> 00:49:43.106 A:middle
So before you perform
the task, Siri will check

00:49:43.106 --> 00:49:46.426 A:middle
with your extension, to make
sure everything's ready.

00:49:47.326 --> 00:49:49.826 A:middle
And it wants to get all
the information back

00:49:50.206 --> 00:49:54.326 A:middle
from your extension, so that it
can then present it to the user.

00:49:56.546 --> 00:50:00.006 A:middle
Now, again, Siri will
present this vocally,

00:49:56.546 --> 00:50:00.006 A:middle
Now, again, Siri will
present this vocally,

00:50:00.006 --> 00:50:02.976 A:middle
and it will provide a UI on
screen to show this information.

00:50:03.046 --> 00:50:05.976 A:middle
If the user decides to continue,

00:50:10.136 --> 00:50:11.896 A:middle
if the user decides to continue,

00:50:12.386 --> 00:50:14.646 A:middle
you should go perform
the action, and again,

00:50:14.916 --> 00:50:19.336 A:middle
return those results back to
Siri so that Siri can show those

00:50:19.336 --> 00:50:20.826 A:middle
to the user and tell the user.

00:50:21.196 --> 00:50:23.976 A:middle
And in the same way that
the user made the request,

00:50:24.136 --> 00:50:28.506 A:middle
they started in a conversation
and Siri can reply back

00:50:28.506 --> 00:50:29.736 A:middle
in the conversation as well.

00:50:31.236 --> 00:50:33.956 A:middle
The great thing about that,
is it works everywhere.

00:50:34.346 --> 00:50:37.666 A:middle
It works in car play, it
works hands free, and it works

00:50:37.666 --> 00:50:39.036 A:middle
when somebody's touching
the device.

00:50:40.866 --> 00:50:44.726 A:middle
And Siri will again, provide
a visual UI to help out.

00:50:46.866 --> 00:50:48.666 A:middle
But, if you want,

00:50:49.416 --> 00:50:52.906 A:middle
your application can provide
a custom UI to bring the feel

00:50:52.906 --> 00:50:54.546 A:middle
of your app into Siri.

00:50:54.816 --> 00:51:00.666 A:middle
I want you to exercise restraint
and limit what you show.

00:50:54.816 --> 00:51:00.666 A:middle
I want you to exercise restraint
and limit what you show.

00:51:01.526 --> 00:51:04.186 A:middle
The person is trying to get a
task done, and you don't want

00:51:04.186 --> 00:51:05.086 A:middle
to distract them

00:51:05.166 --> 00:51:08.226 A:middle
with information
that they don't need.

00:51:08.416 --> 00:51:10.856 A:middle
You also need to make sure
that you're designing this UI

00:51:10.856 --> 00:51:14.396 A:middle
for different screen sizes,
from the smallest phone

00:51:14.396 --> 00:51:14.976 A:middle
up to the biggest iPad.

00:51:19.376 --> 00:51:21.136 A:middle
Here's another example
of the custom UI

00:51:21.136 --> 00:51:22.976 A:middle
from our Unicorn
Chat application.

00:51:28.126 --> 00:51:30.726 A:middle
And as Brandon said,
you should use our API

00:51:30.726 --> 00:51:33.006 A:middle
to hide any redundant
information.

00:51:35.046 --> 00:51:37.206 A:middle
As you do so, you
need to make sure

00:51:37.206 --> 00:51:39.706 A:middle
that your custom UI
represents everything visually,

00:51:40.456 --> 00:51:43.326 A:middle
and that you send all the
information back to Siri

00:51:43.826 --> 00:51:45.936 A:middle
so that hands free
requests will still work

00:51:46.116 --> 00:51:47.216 A:middle
when they can't see this UI.

00:51:49.396 --> 00:51:53.346 A:middle
In a few cases, Siri will
open your application

00:51:53.516 --> 00:51:55.596 A:middle
to finish a request,
and we would do

00:51:55.596 --> 00:51:57.496 A:middle
that for a photo search request

00:51:57.676 --> 00:51:59.456 A:middle
where we can show the
results in your app.

00:51:59.806 --> 00:52:01.876 A:middle
And this is great because
your app can provide the

00:51:59.806 --> 00:52:01.876 A:middle
And this is great because
your app can provide the

00:52:01.876 --> 00:52:02.886 A:middle
follow-up actions.

00:52:03.596 --> 00:52:07.266 A:middle
Now anytime a user goes
from Siri to your app,

00:52:07.896 --> 00:52:09.136 A:middle
you don't want to surprise them.

00:52:09.536 --> 00:52:12.216 A:middle
Don't put any interstitial
information or alerts

00:52:12.216 --> 00:52:14.066 A:middle
in the way, and make sure

00:52:14.066 --> 00:52:16.976 A:middle
that you are only performing the
action that they have requested.

00:52:19.116 --> 00:52:21.596 A:middle
Okay, next, let's
do a couple tips

00:52:22.006 --> 00:52:22.976 A:middle
about polishing your design.

00:52:30.166 --> 00:52:33.966 A:middle
So, earlier Brandon talked about
the app specific vocabulary,

00:52:34.216 --> 00:52:35.686 A:middle
and the examples
that you can give.

00:52:36.566 --> 00:52:39.776 A:middle
And people can find that
information by going to Siri

00:52:40.516 --> 00:52:46.136 A:middle
and just asking,
"What can you do?"

00:52:46.266 --> 00:52:49.196 A:middle
Siri will show lots of
different things that it can do,

00:52:49.196 --> 00:52:52.726 A:middle
including your applications, and
the examples that you provide.

00:52:53.696 --> 00:52:55.476 A:middle
So I want to give you
some tips about how

00:52:55.476 --> 00:52:56.706 A:middle
to write good examples.

00:52:56.706 --> 00:53:00.056 A:middle
Make sure that your examples
include your app name,

00:52:56.706 --> 00:53:00.056 A:middle
Make sure that your examples
include your app name,

00:53:00.296 --> 00:53:03.586 A:middle
so that people can get to your
app for your functionality.

00:53:04.896 --> 00:53:09.636 A:middle
Keep your examples short, and
focused on what your app can do.

00:53:09.856 --> 00:53:12.766 A:middle
You should provide multiple
examples for each intent

00:53:12.766 --> 00:53:14.526 A:middle
that you support, and make sure

00:53:14.526 --> 00:53:16.396 A:middle
that you prioritize
both your intents

00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:18.626 A:middle
and the examples
within those intents.

00:53:20.746 --> 00:53:23.816 A:middle
If your app works in multiple
languages and locales,

00:53:24.586 --> 00:53:26.716 A:middle
make sure that you
provide localized examples

00:53:26.716 --> 00:53:28.706 A:middle
in the appropriate places.

00:53:30.806 --> 00:53:33.786 A:middle
And most importantly,
make sure that they work.

00:53:35.376 --> 00:53:36.886 A:middle
A couple things to avoid.

00:53:37.366 --> 00:53:41.476 A:middle
You don't need to address
Siri in your examples,

00:53:42.406 --> 00:53:45.546 A:middle
and you also don't need any
unnecessary pleasantries.

00:53:45.986 --> 00:53:50.396 A:middle
Just focus on the
functionality of your app.

00:53:50.546 --> 00:53:52.456 A:middle
And the last thing I
want to talk about,

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:54.516 A:middle
is iterating on the experience.

00:53:55.216 --> 00:53:58.456 A:middle
You want to make sure that
you have time to explore

00:53:58.616 --> 00:54:01.976 A:middle
and to experiment in how
you shape the conversation.

00:53:58.616 --> 00:54:01.976 A:middle
and to experiment in how
you shape the conversation.

00:54:04.676 --> 00:54:06.666 A:middle
Make sure that you
talk to real people,

00:54:07.126 --> 00:54:08.766 A:middle
not just what they
would say at first,

00:54:08.956 --> 00:54:12.266 A:middle
but throughout the process
of getting something done.

00:54:13.876 --> 00:54:17.206 A:middle
And again, try it in different
situations, hands free,

00:54:18.156 --> 00:54:20.686 A:middle
or out and about, not
just testing at a desk.

00:54:22.606 --> 00:54:23.646 A:middle
And throughout, make sure

00:54:23.646 --> 00:54:25.796 A:middle
that you are asking,
"Does it feel right?"

00:54:25.796 --> 00:54:29.866 A:middle
If you need to, make a
change, and iterate again,

00:54:30.796 --> 00:54:33.876 A:middle
because we want to
get to a point

00:54:34.226 --> 00:54:37.406 A:middle
where you have a great Siri
experience for your users.

00:54:39.266 --> 00:54:44.216 A:middle
So, let's recap what
we've talked about today.

00:54:44.376 --> 00:54:49.166 A:middle
Robby started us out introducing
SiriKit, bringing the power

00:54:49.166 --> 00:54:53.776 A:middle
of Siri and your applications to
a conversation for your users.

00:54:55.146 --> 00:54:57.606 A:middle
Brandon talked about
creating extensions

00:54:57.606 --> 00:55:01.036 A:middle
and the way they communicate
with Siri through intents

00:54:57.606 --> 00:55:01.036 A:middle
and the way they communicate
with Siri through intents

00:55:01.196 --> 00:55:04.606 A:middle
and intent responses,
and the methods

00:55:04.916 --> 00:55:08.356 A:middle
of resolve, confirm, and handle.

00:55:09.566 --> 00:55:13.376 A:middle
And also that your apps
need to provide vocabulary

00:55:13.786 --> 00:55:16.426 A:middle
of the common things that
people will say to your app.

00:55:17.616 --> 00:55:19.276 A:middle
And then we talked about design.

00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:21.926 A:middle
Introducing the conversational
interaction,

00:55:22.516 --> 00:55:23.886 A:middle
the conversational interface,

00:55:24.616 --> 00:55:27.246 A:middle
and talking about the
options you can choose

00:55:27.246 --> 00:55:28.746 A:middle
as you're developing
your application

00:55:29.196 --> 00:55:31.836 A:middle
that will shape the
conversation for your users.

00:55:33.076 --> 00:55:39.436 A:middle
And last we talked about
iterating, so that we can get

00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:44.096 A:middle
to a Siri experience that
feels effortless, and magical.

00:55:44.786 --> 00:55:47.276 A:middle
We have more information
about this session on the web.

00:55:49.416 --> 00:55:51.546 A:middle
We have some related
sessions this week,

00:55:51.996 --> 00:55:55.776 A:middle
and I want to especially
highlight Extending Your Apps

00:55:55.776 --> 00:55:57.596 A:middle
with SiriKit, which is tomorrow,

00:55:58.056 --> 00:56:01.526 A:middle
where some of our colleagues
will go into more details

00:55:58.056 --> 00:56:01.526 A:middle
where some of our colleagues
will go into more details

00:56:01.526 --> 00:56:03.556 A:middle
about the API and
show you the code

00:56:03.556 --> 00:56:05.476 A:middle
for an example integration
with SiriKit.

00:56:06.506 --> 00:56:08.396 A:middle
So thank you very
much, and we can't wait

00:56:08.396 --> 00:56:08.956 A:middle
to see what you create.

00:56:09.516 --> 00:56:14.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]
