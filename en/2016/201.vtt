[ Music ]

00:00:23.876 --> 00:00:24.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:27.000 A:middle
Hello.

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:30.356 A:middle
Hello.

[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:44.806 A:middle
So hello and welcome
everyone to WWDC.

00:00:44.806 --> 00:00:46.276 A:middle
Looks like it's your first
session this morning.

00:00:46.406 --> 00:00:49.236 A:middle
If you didn't understand
what I said at the beginning

00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:51.296 A:middle
of the talk, you're
at the right talk.

00:00:52.116 --> 00:00:56.196 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit
about internationalization.

00:00:56.496 --> 00:00:58.816 A:middle
So as you might know,

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:03.576 A:middle
Apple ships its products
all over the world.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:03.576 A:middle
Apple ships its products
all over the world.

00:01:03.636 --> 00:01:07.696 A:middle
And two-thirds of Apple's
users are outside the U.S.

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:11.146 A:middle
Which is why it's really
important to make sure

00:01:11.146 --> 00:01:13.696 A:middle
that the linguistic experience
is right in your apps.

00:01:14.246 --> 00:01:17.386 A:middle
So we have users all over
the place from San Francisco

00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:20.266 A:middle
to Milan and Dubai and from
New Delhi to Hong Kong.

00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:24.986 A:middle
And of course these
users are most likely

00:01:24.986 --> 00:01:27.656 A:middle
to be using your
apps and Apple's apps

00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:29.326 A:middle
in their native languages.

00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:34.466 A:middle
They're also likely
to be using these apps

00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.096 A:middle
in languages you didn't expect

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.486 A:middle
that aren't related
to that region.

00:01:37.486 --> 00:01:40.466 A:middle
For example, English, you
might be surprised is a fairly

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:41.256 A:middle
global language.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:48.246 A:middle
So today I'd like to talk
to you about what's new,

00:01:48.416 --> 00:01:51.396 A:middle
what we've been up to for
the last year in the space

00:01:51.396 --> 00:01:52.426 A:middle
of internationalization.

00:01:53.816 --> 00:01:57.016 A:middle
Some fundamentals about getting
started with localization

00:01:57.936 --> 00:02:00.866 A:middle
and internationalizing your app.

00:01:57.936 --> 00:02:00.866 A:middle
and internationalizing your app.

00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:05.106 A:middle
Then some quick fixes that
you can make in your code

00:02:05.106 --> 00:02:07.496 A:middle
to make it a great app
for a worldwide audience.

00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:12.096 A:middle
And lastly, some things to
keep in mind from a design

00:02:12.606 --> 00:02:17.116 A:middle
and mentality standpoint when
you go about making your app.

00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:19.416 A:middle
So let's get started
with what's new.

00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:25.596 A:middle
I'm really excited to talk
about the multilingual keyboards

00:02:25.596 --> 00:02:27.706 A:middle
that we've added in iOS 10.

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:31.416 A:middle
Now if you look around you,
just to your left or right,

00:02:31.746 --> 00:02:35.086 A:middle
you're probably sitting
next to or are a person

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:36.476 A:middle
who speaks more than
one language.

00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:39.946 A:middle
The U.S. is an extremely
multilingual place

00:02:39.946 --> 00:02:41.666 A:middle
and California especially so.

00:02:42.706 --> 00:02:44.766 A:middle
And with iOS 10 we embraced this

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:47.116 A:middle
by offering you multilingual
keyboards.

00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:51.976 A:middle
So you can choose from a mix
of any of the two languages.

00:02:52.696 --> 00:02:56.416 A:middle
Or any two of the languages here
on screen, and you can type them

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:58.896 A:middle
on the same layout without
having to switch the globe key

00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:01.806 A:middle
and you'll get autocorrections
and predictions

00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:01.806 A:middle
and you'll get autocorrections
and predictions

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:02.926 A:middle
for both those languages.

00:03:06.776 --> 00:03:09.546 A:middle
Another enhancement we've
made is the addition

00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:11.126 A:middle
of Latin American Spanish.

00:03:11.716 --> 00:03:15.176 A:middle
And this comes to iOS,
watchOS, and tvOS.

00:03:15.676 --> 00:03:16.916 A:middle
And this is the first time

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:21.386 A:middle
that your app might
encounter a language variant

00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:25.596 A:middle
that is not for specific
country.

00:03:25.596 --> 00:03:27.546 A:middle
And I'll talk about
how that's important

00:03:27.546 --> 00:03:30.986 A:middle
at the code level in a bit.

00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:34.316 A:middle
Another great enhancement is
the new measurement formatter

00:03:34.516 --> 00:03:36.326 A:middle
that is added in foundation.

00:03:36.826 --> 00:03:40.266 A:middle
And this will take care of
unit conversions in a language

00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:43.366 A:middle
and region aware manner
for you all under the hood,

00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:46.126 A:middle
and it already supports
more than 20 different units

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:51.066 A:middle
like temperature, energy,
pressure, you name it.

00:03:51.436 --> 00:03:55.906 A:middle
Now, I won't be going into
depth about this here,

00:03:55.906 --> 00:03:59.356 A:middle
but there's a whole session
dedicated to this on Friday.

00:03:59.356 --> 00:04:00.946 A:middle
So please check that out.

00:03:59.356 --> 00:04:00.946 A:middle
So please check that out.

00:04:02.916 --> 00:04:06.896 A:middle
We've also localized the
keyboard number pads this year.

00:04:07.276 --> 00:04:10.976 A:middle
And so when you request the
number pad keyboard type,

00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:13.166 A:middle
you're automatically
going to get a keyboard

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:14.936 A:middle
that supports different
numbering systems,

00:04:15.336 --> 00:04:16.976 A:middle
such as those used
in Arabic and Hindi.

00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:22.256 A:middle
And when you're in this state,
you're going to see a 123 key

00:04:22.256 --> 00:04:24.506 A:middle
in the bottom left of the
keyboard to let you switch

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:26.036 A:middle
between these different
numbering systems.

00:04:26.306 --> 00:04:30.856 A:middle
Now in some cases,
you might want

00:04:30.856 --> 00:04:35.136 A:middle
to specify ASCII capable number
pad instead when you're sure

00:04:35.366 --> 00:04:37.976 A:middle
that the input that
you have needs

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:39.606 A:middle
to be restricted
to ASCII digits.

00:04:39.956 --> 00:04:44.086 A:middle
Some examples of this are credit
card numbers and IP addresses.

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:46.386 A:middle
They're edge cases, but things
that you should be aware of.

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:52.716 A:middle
One of the huge new features

00:04:52.826 --> 00:04:57.476 A:middle
in macOS Sierra is native
right-to-left support

00:04:57.476 --> 00:04:59.726 A:middle
for languages like
Arabic and Hebrew.

00:05:00.036 --> 00:05:01.646 A:middle
And macOS has been redesigned

00:05:01.776 --> 00:05:03.226 A:middle
with right-to-left
languages in mind.

00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:09.316 A:middle
And of course, macOS joins our
existing family of products

00:05:09.316 --> 00:05:10.926 A:middle
like iOS and watchOS

00:05:10.926 --> 00:05:12.856 A:middle
which already support
right-to-left

00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:13.666 A:middle
languages natively.

00:05:15.126 --> 00:05:18.156 A:middle
Again, this is a huge topic, and
I won't go into this in detail.

00:05:18.566 --> 00:05:20.286 A:middle
And again, there's
a dedicated talk,

00:05:20.346 --> 00:05:24.346 A:middle
What's New in International User
Interfaces on Friday at 9 a.m.

00:05:24.346 --> 00:05:26.946 A:middle
that you should definitely
check out.

00:05:27.486 --> 00:05:30.636 A:middle
So let's get started with
some of the fundamentals

00:05:31.446 --> 00:05:33.666 A:middle
that you need to know
about internationalization.

00:05:34.176 --> 00:05:38.726 A:middle
Let's take a look at an app that
comes with iOS, the Clock app.

00:05:38.906 --> 00:05:39.706 A:middle
It's been re-themed,

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:42.496 A:middle
but probably still
looks familiar to you.

00:05:42.846 --> 00:05:45.436 A:middle
So what are the various
aspects that you would need

00:05:45.486 --> 00:05:47.776 A:middle
to internationalize here
for this app to work

00:05:47.776 --> 00:05:49.036 A:middle
in different languages
and countries?

00:05:51.126 --> 00:05:53.876 A:middle
First of all, you need
to localize the strings.

00:05:53.876 --> 00:05:59.576 A:middle
So this is basically any button
or tab or view that has a string

00:05:59.576 --> 00:06:01.646 A:middle
in it, you need to make
sure that it's translated

00:05:59.576 --> 00:06:01.646 A:middle
in it, you need to make
sure that it's translated

00:06:01.646 --> 00:06:03.656 A:middle
into all the different languages
you're going to be supporting.

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:08.646 A:middle
Then there's another
category of string that needs

00:06:08.646 --> 00:06:11.956 A:middle
to be localized but it
is formatted content

00:06:11.956 --> 00:06:15.806 A:middle
and so you should use
formatters to achieve that.

00:06:16.096 --> 00:06:17.456 A:middle
And this will save
you a lot of work.

00:06:18.036 --> 00:06:22.926 A:middle
And lastly, you need to
internationalize the layout

00:06:23.186 --> 00:06:25.586 A:middle
so that it will work well
for right-to-left languages.

00:06:26.736 --> 00:06:29.526 A:middle
And for languages that have
longer or shorter translations

00:06:29.526 --> 00:06:31.346 A:middle
than the language
you're starting with.

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:36.036 A:middle
So if we do all this right,
then we take this English app

00:06:36.536 --> 00:06:38.266 A:middle
and we translate it
into a Chinese app,

00:06:38.266 --> 00:06:39.626 A:middle
and it looks fantastic.

00:06:40.346 --> 00:06:42.656 A:middle
Notice how in Chinese the a.m.

00:06:42.656 --> 00:06:45.616 A:middle
/p.m. marker goes before
the numbers instead of after

00:06:45.616 --> 00:06:46.546 A:middle
like it does in English.

00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:49.416 A:middle
It'll also work well

00:06:49.416 --> 00:06:51.406 A:middle
for right-to-left
languages like Arabic.

00:06:51.606 --> 00:06:52.716 A:middle
Notice how the layout

00:06:52.716 --> 00:06:54.826 A:middle
of the entire app is
flowing from right-to-left.

00:06:55.756 --> 00:07:00.526 A:middle
And in this case, see how
Arabic is using the Arabic-Indic

00:06:55.756 --> 00:07:00.526 A:middle
And in this case, see how
Arabic is using the Arabic-Indic

00:07:00.526 --> 00:07:02.996 A:middle
numbers which are different
from those used in English.

00:07:03.196 --> 00:07:05.316 A:middle
Again, if you use formatters,
you get this for free.

00:07:06.246 --> 00:07:11.306 A:middle
So those are some fundamentals
for the development side.

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:12.956 A:middle
Let's take a look
at the fundamentals

00:07:12.956 --> 00:07:14.186 A:middle
from the user side as well.

00:07:14.186 --> 00:07:18.216 A:middle
What does a user do when they
get a brand new Apple device

00:07:18.216 --> 00:07:19.206 A:middle
like an iPhone?

00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:22.616 A:middle
Well, every Apple
device that you open

00:07:22.616 --> 00:07:25.146 A:middle
up will first ask you
to choose a language.

00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:29.246 A:middle
And what's going on
under the covers is

00:07:29.246 --> 00:07:32.946 A:middle
that every language has a
code associated with it,

00:07:32.996 --> 00:07:36.086 A:middle
and of course, every region has
a code associated with it also.

00:07:36.736 --> 00:07:40.546 A:middle
So let's say a user chooses
Spanish, United States.

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:43.946 A:middle
What that becomes at the end

00:07:43.946 --> 00:07:49.066 A:middle
of the day is a language
code like es-US.

00:07:49.206 --> 00:07:50.386 A:middle
What you may not know is

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:53.296 A:middle
that language codes are
part of hierarchies.

00:07:53.676 --> 00:07:56.916 A:middle
So for example, Spanish,
United States actually inherits

00:07:56.916 --> 00:07:58.296 A:middle
from Latin American Spanish

00:07:58.296 --> 00:08:00.106 A:middle
which then inherits
from base Spanish.

00:07:58.296 --> 00:08:00.106 A:middle
which then inherits
from base Spanish.

00:08:00.906 --> 00:08:04.186 A:middle
This is really important
because not every app is going

00:08:04.186 --> 00:08:07.606 A:middle
to be localized into
Spanish, United States.

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:10.666 A:middle
So we want to know, okay,
what is the next best language

00:08:10.666 --> 00:08:11.846 A:middle
that the user would prefer

00:08:11.846 --> 00:08:14.696 A:middle
if we don't have their most
preferred language available

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:17.826 A:middle
on the system.

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:21.856 A:middle
Also, this hierarchy is not just
for Spanish but even languages

00:08:21.856 --> 00:08:23.356 A:middle
like English have a hierarchy.

00:08:23.356 --> 00:08:27.346 A:middle
For example, Indian
English has spelling systems

00:08:27.346 --> 00:08:30.616 A:middle
that are more close
to British English

00:08:30.616 --> 00:08:33.916 A:middle
than to American English, and
so it is part of the hierarchy

00:08:33.916 --> 00:08:36.256 A:middle
in which it inherits
from British English.

00:08:36.966 --> 00:08:39.736 A:middle
And English and Spanish are
far from the only two languages

00:08:39.736 --> 00:08:41.086 A:middle
that have such a hierarchy.

00:08:41.556 --> 00:08:44.436 A:middle
We also have other languages
like Chinese, French,

00:08:44.496 --> 00:08:47.076 A:middle
and Portuguese that have
similar hierarchies.

00:08:47.316 --> 00:08:50.036 A:middle
So I hope you all are taking
notes on this, you know,

00:08:50.076 --> 00:08:52.296 A:middle
on these aspects because
no, of course not.

00:08:52.836 --> 00:08:55.486 A:middle
The reason I'm mentioning this
at all is because we're going

00:08:55.486 --> 00:08:57.196 A:middle
to help you solve this
problem, and you don't need

00:08:57.196 --> 00:08:58.346 A:middle
to know anything about this.

00:08:58.786 --> 00:09:00.116 A:middle
So I'm going to show
you how to do

00:08:58.786 --> 00:09:00.116 A:middle
So I'm going to show
you how to do

00:09:00.116 --> 00:09:02.786 A:middle
that in the next
section with quick fixes.

00:09:04.326 --> 00:09:06.596 A:middle
So what's the first
thing we need to do?

00:09:06.596 --> 00:09:07.906 A:middle
We need to localize the strings.

00:09:08.416 --> 00:09:09.776 A:middle
Now there is a little
bit of setup.

00:09:10.076 --> 00:09:10.706 A:middle
It's simple.

00:09:10.896 --> 00:09:14.856 A:middle
But there's some setup
involved, and I won't be talking

00:09:14.856 --> 00:09:17.106 A:middle
about that in detail
because there's a whole --

00:09:17.706 --> 00:09:20.176 A:middle
there's a lot of documentation,
and there's another talk

00:09:20.176 --> 00:09:22.376 A:middle
that goes into detail about
how to set up your app.

00:09:23.036 --> 00:09:25.976 A:middle
So let's assume that you've got
your setup for localization,

00:09:25.976 --> 00:09:29.246 A:middle
so you've got some
localized strings in your app.

00:09:30.306 --> 00:09:32.276 A:middle
If you're using storyboards

00:09:32.556 --> 00:09:35.006 A:middle
with Base Internationalization,
you're done.

00:09:35.586 --> 00:09:36.746 A:middle
There's nothing you need to do.

00:09:36.746 --> 00:09:37.446 A:middle
You launch your app.

00:09:37.506 --> 00:09:38.346 A:middle
The strings get loaded.

00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:39.506 A:middle
You're golden.

00:09:41.856 --> 00:09:46.056 A:middle
If you are creating or loading
strings in code, then you need

00:09:46.056 --> 00:09:47.396 A:middle
to call NSLocalizedString.

00:09:47.926 --> 00:09:51.786 A:middle
NSLocalizedString will use the
fantastic logic that I mentioned

00:09:51.786 --> 00:09:52.636 A:middle
with all the fallback,

00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:55.146 A:middle
and it will load the most
appropriate string for you.

00:09:55.576 --> 00:09:58.156 A:middle
Now, note that it's
important to provide a comment

00:09:58.156 --> 00:10:00.616 A:middle
to your translator because
oftentimes words are

00:09:58.156 --> 00:10:00.616 A:middle
to your translator because
oftentimes words are

00:10:00.616 --> 00:10:03.716 A:middle
distinguished by which
context they're in

00:10:03.716 --> 00:10:05.746 A:middle
and the comment helps
clarify that.

00:10:06.366 --> 00:10:10.766 A:middle
Let's move on to slightly
more complex scenario.

00:10:10.796 --> 00:10:13.046 A:middle
Let's say you're getting
strings from a remote service

00:10:13.316 --> 00:10:16.156 A:middle
like a server or
another process.

00:10:16.456 --> 00:10:19.216 A:middle
Well, in that case you
probably want to let the server

00:10:19.216 --> 00:10:20.476 A:middle
or the other process know,

00:10:20.476 --> 00:10:22.876 A:middle
hey this is the language
my app is launched in,

00:10:22.946 --> 00:10:24.786 A:middle
please give me strings
that match this.

00:10:25.186 --> 00:10:28.756 A:middle
And in order to do that, you
can call preferredLocalizations

00:10:28.826 --> 00:10:30.616 A:middle
on the Bundle that
you're launched from

00:10:30.946 --> 00:10:32.856 A:middle
and get the first
language and give

00:10:32.856 --> 00:10:34.626 A:middle
that to your remote service.

00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:41.726 A:middle
If you have an even
more involved setup

00:10:41.726 --> 00:10:44.736 A:middle
and for some reason you have
a list of available languages,

00:10:44.736 --> 00:10:47.596 A:middle
say, on the server that
don't match exactly the list

00:10:47.596 --> 00:10:48.906 A:middle
of languages you
have on the client.

00:10:48.906 --> 00:10:51.146 A:middle
Let's say you have a
larger set on the server,

00:10:51.436 --> 00:10:56.136 A:middle
then you can call the class
method preferredLocalizations

00:10:56.436 --> 00:10:58.106 A:middle
and give it the available
set that you have.

00:10:58.106 --> 00:11:00.156 A:middle
And again, it will match
you to the right language.

00:10:58.106 --> 00:11:00.156 A:middle
And again, it will match
you to the right language.

00:11:01.716 --> 00:11:06.656 A:middle
So I mentioned this Bundle's
language matching logic multiple

00:11:06.656 --> 00:11:08.246 A:middle
times during the
last few slides.

00:11:08.526 --> 00:11:09.646 A:middle
So what is all this about?

00:11:09.646 --> 00:11:11.536 A:middle
And what is Bundle doing
for you under the hood?

00:11:12.556 --> 00:11:16.386 A:middle
So what Bundle does for you is
that it figures out things like,

00:11:16.456 --> 00:11:21.666 A:middle
okay user prefers English
U.S. We don't have an English

00:11:21.666 --> 00:11:23.446 A:middle
U.S. localization.

00:11:23.446 --> 00:11:24.356 A:middle
We do have an English.

00:11:24.466 --> 00:11:26.916 A:middle
So okay, in this case it
will give you English.

00:11:27.206 --> 00:11:29.666 A:middle
It figures out things like
you want Indian English,

00:11:29.706 --> 00:11:33.566 A:middle
but we have British but not
Indian, we'll give you that.

00:11:33.936 --> 00:11:37.206 A:middle
And again, with the Spanish
Latin America example,

00:11:37.506 --> 00:11:40.996 A:middle
if you say I prefer Mexican
Spanish, it will figure

00:11:40.996 --> 00:11:43.326 A:middle
out that oh the best
match for you

00:11:43.326 --> 00:11:45.846 A:middle
in the list shown here is
Latin American Spanish.

00:11:46.276 --> 00:11:49.216 A:middle
And similarly, for Chinese
and many other languages.

00:11:49.216 --> 00:11:52.216 A:middle
This is a lot of
complicated locale aware logic

00:11:52.216 --> 00:11:55.076 A:middle
that you do not want to be
implementing in your apps.

00:11:55.136 --> 00:11:57.086 A:middle
And definitely if you have
code that does something

00:11:57.086 --> 00:12:00.676 A:middle
like take the language
identifier and split it

00:11:57.086 --> 00:12:00.676 A:middle
like take the language
identifier and split it

00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:02.796 A:middle
on hyphens or something like
that, please go and delete

00:12:02.796 --> 00:12:04.826 A:middle
that code because you
should not be doing that.

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:10.466 A:middle
So now you've localized all your
strings and used the right APIs.

00:12:11.156 --> 00:12:12.046 A:middle
You want to double check

00:12:12.046 --> 00:12:14.446 A:middle
that everything you have
done is actually localized.

00:12:14.746 --> 00:12:18.256 A:middle
To do that, you can use the
new static analyzer in Xcode 8,

00:12:18.536 --> 00:12:21.576 A:middle
which will actually find
any issues that you have

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:22.606 A:middle
with localizability,

00:12:22.606 --> 00:12:25.096 A:middle
where you're feeding
non-localized strings

00:12:25.196 --> 00:12:25.726 A:middle
into the UI.

00:12:25.936 --> 00:12:30.946 A:middle
And that's all there is to
localized strings, really.

00:12:31.076 --> 00:12:32.216 A:middle
Next let's talk about
formatters.

00:12:32.966 --> 00:12:37.326 A:middle
This is a common kind of
app that you see these days

00:12:37.326 --> 00:12:39.406 A:middle
with all the delivery services.

00:12:39.806 --> 00:12:43.976 A:middle
And this, however, is not a good
thing that you're seeing here.

00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:48.736 A:middle
So it says AM9:41, which to an
English user will definitely

00:12:48.736 --> 00:12:49.746 A:middle
look like nonsense.

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:54.666 A:middle
But believe me, I've
seen this in a real app.

00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:57.456 A:middle
And similarly, you might see
something that is the opposite

00:12:57.456 --> 00:12:59.646 A:middle
in Chinese where
it puts the a.m.

00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:01.196 A:middle
/p.m. marker after the numbers,

00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:01.196 A:middle
/p.m. marker after the numbers,

00:13:01.196 --> 00:13:02.996 A:middle
which is completely
wrong for Chinese.

00:13:03.746 --> 00:13:06.986 A:middle
So how do we avoid
bugs like these?

00:13:09.116 --> 00:13:13.566 A:middle
The problem is actually
that we're using this method

00:13:13.566 --> 00:13:17.136 A:middle
which is formatter.dateFormat
setting a fixed format on it.

00:13:17.656 --> 00:13:19.266 A:middle
It seems like the
right thing to do.

00:13:19.696 --> 00:13:21.256 A:middle
It looks pretty nice in code,

00:13:21.646 --> 00:13:23.246 A:middle
but it's actually
the wrong approach.

00:13:24.406 --> 00:13:27.156 A:middle
And although it yields the
right result when you try it

00:13:27.156 --> 00:13:30.656 A:middle
out for English, so it'll give
you 9:41 a.m. you try the same

00:13:30.656 --> 00:13:33.016 A:middle
thing out in Chinese, and it
gives you the wrong result.

00:13:33.106 --> 00:13:36.466 A:middle
Why? Because it's applying
a fixed format to no matter

00:13:36.466 --> 00:13:38.776 A:middle
which language you're
running in.

00:13:40.076 --> 00:13:41.626 A:middle
The correct approach for this is

00:13:41.626 --> 00:13:45.536 A:middle
to just use the predefined short
style on the date formatter.

00:13:45.596 --> 00:13:47.916 A:middle
And it's going to give you
the right result for English,

00:13:48.966 --> 00:13:51.696 A:middle
for Chinese, and for any other
language your app might be

00:13:51.696 --> 00:13:52.286 A:middle
localized in.

00:13:53.326 --> 00:13:55.696 A:middle
And of course, there
are more styles.

00:13:55.846 --> 00:13:58.406 A:middle
So we have the short style
that I just showed you.

00:13:58.746 --> 00:14:00.996 A:middle
You can also get a
slightly longer style,

00:13:58.746 --> 00:14:00.996 A:middle
You can also get a
slightly longer style,

00:14:00.996 --> 00:14:01.836 A:middle
which has the seconds.

00:14:01.956 --> 00:14:04.176 A:middle
You can have a style
which has the time zone

00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:05.826 A:middle
or the full time zone name.

00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:08.056 A:middle
There are variety of different
styles for different needs.

00:14:08.706 --> 00:14:11.476 A:middle
And of course, not
just for times.

00:14:11.706 --> 00:14:14.246 A:middle
For dates, also, we
have the whole range

00:14:14.246 --> 00:14:16.226 A:middle
of styles going from
short to long.

00:14:17.396 --> 00:14:20.276 A:middle
Now you might come back to me
and say, "okay, sure but none

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:21.976 A:middle
of those styles is
what my designer wants.

00:14:21.976 --> 00:14:24.796 A:middle
They want, you know,
just the full year

00:14:24.796 --> 00:14:25.936 A:middle
or just this or just that."

00:14:26.406 --> 00:14:26.906 A:middle
That's fine.

00:14:27.346 --> 00:14:30.106 A:middle
So you can use a format.

00:14:30.676 --> 00:14:32.756 A:middle
The important thing is to use it

00:14:32.886 --> 00:14:36.886 A:middle
with the setLocalizedDate
FormatFrom Template method,

00:14:37.146 --> 00:14:41.566 A:middle
which will make sure that it
takes your format, interprets it

00:14:41.626 --> 00:14:43.356 A:middle
for the current language
in question

00:14:43.596 --> 00:14:46.236 A:middle
and gives you the
correct localized format

00:14:46.236 --> 00:14:47.196 A:middle
for that language.

00:14:49.756 --> 00:14:53.946 A:middle
There are also two classes
that you might not have used.

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:57.226 A:middle
They're fairly new, although not
new this year, date components,

00:14:57.226 --> 00:15:00.106 A:middle
which will let you format, say,

00:14:57.226 --> 00:15:00.106 A:middle
which will let you format, say,

00:15:00.326 --> 00:15:02.486 A:middle
a duration like 4
hours and 25 minutes.

00:15:03.536 --> 00:15:07.786 A:middle
Or a date interval like
the duration of this talk,

00:15:07.956 --> 00:15:11.886 A:middle
9 to 9:40 a.m. So the
advantage to these, again,

00:15:11.936 --> 00:15:14.026 A:middle
is that if you use
these classes,

00:15:14.466 --> 00:15:17.066 A:middle
all the localization is going
to get taken care of for you.

00:15:17.596 --> 00:15:23.746 A:middle
Next let's talk about
another kind of data type

00:15:23.746 --> 00:15:25.286 A:middle
that you can format, names.

00:15:27.616 --> 00:15:32.236 A:middle
Now, if this is how you're
going to show the user's name

00:15:32.236 --> 00:15:36.166 A:middle
or their friend's name to
them when they open your app,

00:15:36.166 --> 00:15:38.646 A:middle
they're going to get a really
bad impression of your app.

00:15:39.076 --> 00:15:41.346 A:middle
So let's not do that.

00:15:41.996 --> 00:15:46.336 A:middle
Instead, you should show the
names in the way that is correct

00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:49.126 A:middle
for that given language
and script.

00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:51.256 A:middle
So how do we do that?

00:15:52.736 --> 00:15:54.526 A:middle
It's actually really simple.

00:15:56.076 --> 00:15:58.986 A:middle
You create a
PersonNameComponents object.

00:15:59.116 --> 00:16:01.906 A:middle
Fill it with some name
components, and then just

00:15:59.116 --> 00:16:01.906 A:middle
Fill it with some name
components, and then just

00:16:01.906 --> 00:16:05.206 A:middle
like any other formatter,
you just ask for the string

00:16:05.376 --> 00:16:08.536 A:middle
from the components for any
given style that you want.

00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:11.096 A:middle
And again, we have a variety
of styles going from long,

00:16:11.446 --> 00:16:14.036 A:middle
which is the full name
all the way to abbreviated

00:16:14.036 --> 00:16:15.276 A:middle
which you can use for initials.

00:16:16.696 --> 00:16:20.056 A:middle
And of course, it supports
multiple languages.

00:16:20.586 --> 00:16:26.056 A:middle
New this year, though,
is name parsing support.

00:16:26.426 --> 00:16:30.186 A:middle
So now you can go from a full
name to a set of components.

00:16:31.196 --> 00:16:34.806 A:middle
And it's as easy as creating a
formatter, giving it a string,

00:16:35.256 --> 00:16:36.816 A:middle
and then looking
at the components.

00:16:37.336 --> 00:16:39.186 A:middle
If it returns nil, it
means it wasn't able

00:16:39.186 --> 00:16:42.816 A:middle
to successfully construct
components out of it.

00:16:43.756 --> 00:16:45.206 A:middle
The really cool thing, though,

00:16:45.206 --> 00:16:48.416 A:middle
is that this is not a
static API that's looking

00:16:48.416 --> 00:16:50.286 A:middle
at some set of static rules.

00:16:50.516 --> 00:16:55.026 A:middle
It's actually a statistical
model so that even if you pass

00:16:55.026 --> 00:16:56.716 A:middle
in the name in the
opposite order,

00:16:56.946 --> 00:17:01.666 A:middle
it knows that in John Appleseed,
John is much more likely

00:16:56.946 --> 00:17:01.666 A:middle
it knows that in John Appleseed,
John is much more likely

00:17:01.666 --> 00:17:04.695 A:middle
to be the given name and
Appleseed the family name.

00:17:04.695 --> 00:17:06.266 A:middle
And it's still going
to parse it correctly.

00:17:06.896 --> 00:17:11.806 A:middle
And of course, it supports
multiple languages as well.

00:17:14.175 --> 00:17:16.616 A:middle
So there are a lot
of formatters.

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:19.536 A:middle
I talked about Date

00:17:19.906 --> 00:17:23.786 A:middle
and
PersonNameComponentsFormatters

00:17:23.786 --> 00:17:24.425 A:middle
in detail.

00:17:25.195 --> 00:17:29.626 A:middle
The components and interval
formatters for dates, briefly.

00:17:30.046 --> 00:17:32.646 A:middle
And there are some formatters
I didn't even mention

00:17:32.646 --> 00:17:36.026 A:middle
which are existing formatters
that we have in the system.

00:17:37.186 --> 00:17:41.686 A:middle
And there's the brand new
measurement formatter that's new

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.406 A:middle
in this set of releases.

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:47.436 A:middle
So be sure to use these
formatters wherever you can

00:17:47.436 --> 00:17:49.576 A:middle
in your code because they
will do the right thing,

00:17:49.576 --> 00:17:51.756 A:middle
and you will also save
localized strings.

00:17:53.136 --> 00:17:54.726 A:middle
Which you shouldn't be
using for these cases.

00:17:56.216 --> 00:18:02.396 A:middle
So that's all about at this
point your whole UI is localized

00:17:56.216 --> 00:18:02.396 A:middle
So that's all about at this
point your whole UI is localized

00:18:02.396 --> 00:18:03.116 A:middle
in terms of strings.

00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:05.646 A:middle
Now let's take a look at
what you need to do in terms

00:18:05.646 --> 00:18:07.316 A:middle
of the layout to make sure

00:18:07.316 --> 00:18:10.256 A:middle
that the UI actually works
well with those strings.

00:18:12.086 --> 00:18:16.256 A:middle
So the key word here
is Auto Layout.

00:18:16.616 --> 00:18:20.876 A:middle
It does what it's intended --
what its name tells you it does,

00:18:20.876 --> 00:18:22.646 A:middle
which is it automatically
lays things out.

00:18:23.246 --> 00:18:25.436 A:middle
And so whether you're
in a left-to-right app,

00:18:26.746 --> 00:18:30.706 A:middle
if you use Auto Layout you
will get automatically a user

00:18:30.706 --> 00:18:33.026 A:middle
interface for a right-to-left
language.

00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:38.276 A:middle
And again, Auto Layout is a big
topic, and I'm not going to go

00:18:38.276 --> 00:18:41.386 A:middle
into detail into how you
should use Auto Layout

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:44.246 A:middle
because there are sessions
for that both this year

00:18:44.246 --> 00:18:48.326 A:middle
and from previous years that go
into a fair amount of detail.

00:18:49.756 --> 00:18:53.166 A:middle
What I will tell you is that
you should use UIStackView

00:18:53.166 --> 00:18:58.706 A:middle
and NSStackView as much as you
can because these are very easy

00:18:58.706 --> 00:19:01.466 A:middle
to use APIs that leverage
Auto Layout and make sure

00:18:58.706 --> 00:19:01.466 A:middle
to use APIs that leverage
Auto Layout and make sure

00:19:01.786 --> 00:19:05.616 A:middle
that your views will
flip in the right way

00:19:05.616 --> 00:19:07.996 A:middle
for right-to-left languages
and adjust appropriately

00:19:07.996 --> 00:19:09.966 A:middle
when they get long
and shorter strings.

00:19:11.056 --> 00:19:14.546 A:middle
So we will have sample code
for you that shows you how

00:19:14.546 --> 00:19:21.196 A:middle
to implement a version of the
Clock app using Stack Views.

00:19:23.046 --> 00:19:25.726 A:middle
Now one thing that you
might want to keep in mind

00:19:25.726 --> 00:19:29.096 A:middle
for layout is that sometimes
you need to get creative.

00:19:29.696 --> 00:19:31.446 A:middle
Now you see this
screen in English.

00:19:31.656 --> 00:19:33.526 A:middle
Are you sure you don't
want to use an Apple ID?

00:19:34.226 --> 00:19:37.846 A:middle
And you have two options there,
Use Apple ID or Don't Use.

00:19:37.846 --> 00:19:40.976 A:middle
Now in some languages you can
imagine the translations might

00:19:41.016 --> 00:19:43.616 A:middle
be longer than can fit in
two side-by-side buttons.

00:19:44.626 --> 00:19:45.756 A:middle
So what do you do?

00:19:46.146 --> 00:19:50.146 A:middle
Well, in this case, you see
that the whole view switches

00:19:50.146 --> 00:19:52.236 A:middle
to a top-bottom orientation
instead

00:19:52.236 --> 00:19:53.586 A:middle
of a left-right orientation.

00:19:54.196 --> 00:19:58.106 A:middle
And these kind of creative
UI elements are things

00:19:58.106 --> 00:20:02.596 A:middle
that you should keep in mind for
your apps before you ask a --

00:19:58.106 --> 00:20:02.596 A:middle
that you should keep in mind for
your apps before you ask a --

00:20:03.066 --> 00:20:07.726 A:middle
you ask a translator to
shorten a string to the point

00:20:07.726 --> 00:20:10.396 A:middle
where it might not even be
intelligible in that language.

00:20:14.176 --> 00:20:16.286 A:middle
The next thing is
vertical flexibility.

00:20:16.286 --> 00:20:21.076 A:middle
And a lot of you may not
have realized this before

00:20:21.076 --> 00:20:21.906 A:middle
for your apps.

00:20:22.936 --> 00:20:28.136 A:middle
So we have a lot of scripts
in the OS for languages

00:20:28.136 --> 00:20:32.776 A:middle
like Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic,
and Hindi that go much higher

00:20:32.876 --> 00:20:37.026 A:middle
or lower or both than the basic
Latin alphabet that's used

00:20:37.076 --> 00:20:37.936 A:middle
to write English.

00:20:39.336 --> 00:20:43.196 A:middle
And so what happens
often is we see this bug,

00:20:43.526 --> 00:20:46.366 A:middle
which is that somebody
might set clipsToBounds

00:20:46.366 --> 00:20:48.246 A:middle
to true on the label.

00:20:48.746 --> 00:20:52.126 A:middle
And what that does is it clips
the text often on both side

00:20:52.786 --> 00:20:59.156 A:middle
and besides being very ugly and,
you know, just looking terrible

00:20:59.156 --> 00:21:04.336 A:middle
in that language, you often lose
important semantic information

00:20:59.156 --> 00:21:04.336 A:middle
in that language, you often lose
important semantic information

00:21:04.336 --> 00:21:05.756 A:middle
like a diacritic mark.

00:21:06.376 --> 00:21:09.726 A:middle
In this case the pronunciation
of all of the words

00:21:09.726 --> 00:21:13.386 A:middle
on the right is changing
when you clip them like this.

00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:16.716 A:middle
So to fix this it's
pretty simple.

00:21:16.716 --> 00:21:20.106 A:middle
Don't set clipsToBounds to
true if you have a label.

00:21:20.716 --> 00:21:23.316 A:middle
And that should be enough
to solve this problem.

00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:29.706 A:middle
More interestingly, though,
when you have multi-line labels,

00:21:29.836 --> 00:21:32.846 A:middle
you also need to consider
interline spacing.

00:21:33.686 --> 00:21:36.856 A:middle
So let's take a look here
which has Hindi on the left

00:21:36.916 --> 00:21:38.736 A:middle
and English on the right.

00:21:39.896 --> 00:21:41.846 A:middle
And here it's English
on the left and Hindi

00:21:41.846 --> 00:21:43.246 A:middle
on the right, sorry about that.

00:21:43.906 --> 00:21:48.756 A:middle
But see what happens when
we try to squeeze Hindi

00:21:48.756 --> 00:21:51.796 A:middle
into the same amount of
vertical space as English?

00:21:52.506 --> 00:21:55.126 A:middle
It looks really cramped.

00:21:55.126 --> 00:22:00.546 A:middle
And any Hindi reader will tell
you this is really hard to read,

00:21:55.126 --> 00:22:00.546 A:middle
And any Hindi reader will tell
you this is really hard to read,

00:22:01.056 --> 00:22:02.536 A:middle
and it doesn't look nice.

00:22:04.026 --> 00:22:05.816 A:middle
So what you really need to do is

00:22:05.846 --> 00:22:08.866 A:middle
to give each script the
room it needs to breathe

00:22:08.866 --> 00:22:12.096 A:middle
and to look good on screen
and to be easy to read.

00:22:12.376 --> 00:22:14.656 A:middle
The good news is that
this is really easy to do.

00:22:15.946 --> 00:22:18.556 A:middle
Any time you have a
multi-line label, again,

00:22:18.696 --> 00:22:21.186 A:middle
a lot of this is done by default
but you just need to be sure

00:22:21.186 --> 00:22:23.416 A:middle
when you set a custom font
that you do the right thing

00:22:23.856 --> 00:22:27.256 A:middle
that you get a preferred
font using the UI font API.

00:22:28.626 --> 00:22:32.936 A:middle
Now, you might say, okay
I have a custom font

00:22:32.936 --> 00:22:34.636 A:middle
and I can't use this.

00:22:34.926 --> 00:22:39.056 A:middle
Well, there is a solution
for you, and you should check

00:22:39.476 --> 00:22:43.446 A:middle
out the fonts and typography
talk on Wednesday that goes

00:22:43.446 --> 00:22:45.776 A:middle
into more detail about
how you can make sure

00:22:45.776 --> 00:22:52.966 A:middle
that a custom font will
also adhere to dynamic type.

00:22:54.156 --> 00:22:58.966 A:middle
Next, for table views, we
do something really neat,

00:22:58.966 --> 00:23:01.716 A:middle
which is that if you have a
language with a taller script,

00:22:58.966 --> 00:23:01.716 A:middle
which is that if you have a
language with a taller script,

00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:07.536 A:middle
we will actually make the table
row height larger than it is

00:23:07.586 --> 00:23:09.136 A:middle
in other languages like English.

00:23:09.776 --> 00:23:12.596 A:middle
Again, this gives the script
the room it needs to breathe,

00:23:12.596 --> 00:23:15.936 A:middle
and it just overall looks more
natural for those languages.

00:23:17.196 --> 00:23:20.226 A:middle
The way you can take
advantage of this code is

00:23:20.226 --> 00:23:23.556 A:middle
by using the standard
UITableViewCell styles.

00:23:24.086 --> 00:23:26.976 A:middle
And now you might say, okay,
sure but I have a custom cell,

00:23:26.976 --> 00:23:28.706 A:middle
you know, it's not
going to work with this.

00:23:28.706 --> 00:23:30.776 A:middle
I mean, I don't just have
a label and you know,

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:32.086 A:middle
it's not as simple
as you think it is.

00:23:32.086 --> 00:23:33.126 A:middle
And I'll be like, okay sure.

00:23:33.696 --> 00:23:37.466 A:middle
I agree. But what
I found at least

00:23:37.466 --> 00:23:42.546 A:middle
in using UITableViewCell is
that it is highly customizable.

00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:45.066 A:middle
It has a bunch of
overrides that you can use,

00:23:45.196 --> 00:23:47.436 A:middle
usually to get exactly
the appearance you want.

00:23:47.686 --> 00:23:51.406 A:middle
So try that first before you're
implementing a completely

00:23:51.976 --> 00:23:53.346 A:middle
custom UITableViewCell.

00:23:56.876 --> 00:24:01.326 A:middle
So that's mostly what I have
in terms of small code fixes

00:23:56.876 --> 00:24:01.326 A:middle
So that's mostly what I have
in terms of small code fixes

00:24:01.326 --> 00:24:04.516 A:middle
that will make your app great
for an international audience.

00:24:05.046 --> 00:24:07.676 A:middle
Let's talk about some things
that are more abstract

00:24:07.676 --> 00:24:09.166 A:middle
that are more design based.

00:24:10.256 --> 00:24:12.826 A:middle
And also the mentality
you need to keep in mind

00:24:13.396 --> 00:24:15.406 A:middle
for making great apps.

00:24:16.736 --> 00:24:18.856 A:middle
First of all, it's
the iconography.

00:24:19.716 --> 00:24:23.296 A:middle
Now you know that when you go to
the App Store and you're looking

00:24:23.296 --> 00:24:25.166 A:middle
for an app one of the
first things you're going

00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:26.456 A:middle
to notice is that icon.

00:24:27.006 --> 00:24:29.036 A:middle
And oftentimes, at
least I've done this,

00:24:29.036 --> 00:24:31.086 A:middle
if the icon doesn't look
good I don't buy the app

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.596 A:middle
because that's going to
go on my Home Screen.

00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:35.736 A:middle
And I don't want to have an app
there that doesn't look good.

00:24:36.446 --> 00:24:39.546 A:middle
So icons are really important,
and it's also important

00:24:39.546 --> 00:24:42.816 A:middle
that the icon that
you choose works well

00:24:43.186 --> 00:24:45.676 A:middle
for different languages
and also languages that go

00:24:45.676 --> 00:24:48.586 A:middle
in different layout directions

00:24:48.586 --> 00:24:49.976 A:middle
like left-to-right
or right-to-left.

00:24:50.576 --> 00:24:53.346 A:middle
So photos has a great icon here.

00:24:53.346 --> 00:24:58.036 A:middle
This is a great example of an
icon that doesn't have any words

00:24:58.036 --> 00:25:02.056 A:middle
or numbers that would tie
it to a specific language.

00:24:58.036 --> 00:25:02.056 A:middle
or numbers that would tie
it to a specific language.

00:25:02.646 --> 00:25:04.406 A:middle
It also doesn't have
a directionality

00:25:04.406 --> 00:25:05.916 A:middle
like left-to-right
or right-to-left.

00:25:06.286 --> 00:25:08.966 A:middle
So it really works well,
you know, in Japanese,

00:25:08.966 --> 00:25:10.426 A:middle
in English, and in Arabic.

00:25:11.166 --> 00:25:15.886 A:middle
Now if you are making a
right-to-left localization,

00:25:16.326 --> 00:25:19.566 A:middle
and you want to make sure
your UI is really good

00:25:19.566 --> 00:25:20.706 A:middle
for right-to-left languages.

00:25:21.676 --> 00:25:23.856 A:middle
You should take a look at some
of the artwork you're using.

00:25:24.186 --> 00:25:27.146 A:middle
And if you are using artwork
that has a directionality to it

00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:29.686 A:middle
that would need to change
for a right-to-left language,

00:25:30.046 --> 00:25:33.916 A:middle
then you would probably need to
flip or create dedicated artwork

00:25:33.916 --> 00:25:35.106 A:middle
for right-to-left languages.

00:25:35.466 --> 00:25:38.116 A:middle
Now here you see an
example of artwork

00:25:38.116 --> 00:25:39.976 A:middle
that you can't just
flip horizontally.

00:25:39.976 --> 00:25:42.306 A:middle
You need to create
dedicated artwork if you're

00:25:42.436 --> 00:25:43.656 A:middle
in a right-to-left language.

00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:47.776 A:middle
But if you do have images
that just need to be flipped,

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:49.796 A:middle
there is actually API for
that and you don't need

00:25:49.796 --> 00:25:50.886 A:middle
to create separate artwork.

00:25:51.826 --> 00:25:54.376 A:middle
There's more information about
that, again, in the What's New

00:25:54.376 --> 00:25:57.246 A:middle
in International
Interfaces session on Friday.

00:25:58.466 --> 00:26:03.056 A:middle
But the key is asset catalogues.

00:25:58.466 --> 00:26:03.056 A:middle
But the key is asset catalogues.

00:26:03.876 --> 00:26:06.866 A:middle
Another thing that you might
or might not have thought

00:26:06.866 --> 00:26:08.476 A:middle
about is your app's name.

00:26:09.776 --> 00:26:12.896 A:middle
Now, when looking at various
App Stores around the world,

00:26:13.166 --> 00:26:16.036 A:middle
one consistent theme we've
seen that doesn't surprise us

00:26:16.036 --> 00:26:19.506 A:middle
in the least is that users
are more likely to buy apps

00:26:19.846 --> 00:26:21.656 A:middle
that work for them
in their language.

00:26:21.936 --> 00:26:24.356 A:middle
And that applies to
the apps' name as well.

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:27.986 A:middle
Because if they can -- if they
can understand easily what your

00:26:27.986 --> 00:26:31.516 A:middle
app does by looking at the
one line name and description,

00:26:31.826 --> 00:26:33.776 A:middle
then they're much more likely

00:26:34.046 --> 00:26:40.426 A:middle
to tap inside the
app to take a look.

00:26:40.426 --> 00:26:42.966 A:middle
And of course, the world is --

00:26:43.516 --> 00:26:47.046 A:middle
users all over the world are
more and more multilingual

00:26:47.246 --> 00:26:48.866 A:middle
or at least they're bilingual.

00:26:49.426 --> 00:26:52.926 A:middle
So your app should
not make assumptions

00:26:53.016 --> 00:26:58.586 A:middle
about the UI language and
how it relates to the content

00:26:58.786 --> 00:26:59.776 A:middle
that the user will type.

00:27:00.256 --> 00:27:04.766 A:middle
For example, a very common theme
you will see all over countries

00:27:04.806 --> 00:27:08.196 A:middle
in Asia like India
and Southeast Asia is

00:27:08.196 --> 00:27:10.906 A:middle
that people will run
their phones in English,

00:27:11.326 --> 00:27:14.556 A:middle
but they'll have content
in their local languages

00:27:14.556 --> 00:27:15.786 A:middle
like Hindi in this case.

00:27:16.806 --> 00:27:20.996 A:middle
So when you have an app and you
run in English, don't assume

00:27:20.996 --> 00:27:22.706 A:middle
that the user's going
to type English text,

00:27:22.786 --> 00:27:25.896 A:middle
especially make sure to
test your app with Chinese

00:27:25.896 --> 00:27:27.416 A:middle
and Japanese keyboards
to make sure

00:27:27.416 --> 00:27:29.036 A:middle
that the experience works well.

00:27:32.916 --> 00:27:37.266 A:middle
And here's an example that I
wanted to show you of an app

00:27:37.726 --> 00:27:40.886 A:middle
that in our opinion
does a really great job

00:27:40.886 --> 00:27:42.186 A:middle
at the things I just
talked about.

00:27:43.616 --> 00:27:44.516 A:middle
So this is Evernote.

00:27:45.286 --> 00:27:47.826 A:middle
And first of all,
you'll see the app icon.

00:27:48.546 --> 00:27:50.466 A:middle
It doesn't have any words
or symbols or anything

00:27:50.466 --> 00:27:53.446 A:middle
that would associate it
with a single language.

00:27:54.596 --> 00:27:55.826 A:middle
So that's great.

00:27:58.036 --> 00:27:59.976 A:middle
However, they have also gone

00:28:00.176 --> 00:28:03.496 A:middle
and localized their
app name into Chinese.

00:28:03.546 --> 00:28:05.536 A:middle
And this is actually if
you're a Chinese speaker,

00:28:05.536 --> 00:28:10.006 A:middle
you'll see that they have
a great visual pun in there

00:28:10.106 --> 00:28:12.066 A:middle
because the Chinese word

00:28:12.066 --> 00:28:15.336 A:middle
that they've chosen also
contains the character

00:28:15.336 --> 00:28:20.616 A:middle
for elephant, which is their
icons, which is kind of cool.

00:28:20.836 --> 00:28:23.336 A:middle
You'll also notice that they
have localized screenshots.

00:28:24.246 --> 00:28:29.366 A:middle
And there's a lot of attention
to detail in those screenshots.

00:28:29.366 --> 00:28:32.016 A:middle
You'll see, for example, that
in the localized screenshot

00:28:32.276 --> 00:28:34.726 A:middle
in which they're
creating a note,

00:28:35.516 --> 00:28:37.586 A:middle
you actually have the
Chinese keyboard on screen.

00:28:37.586 --> 00:28:39.116 A:middle
So the user is seeing

00:28:39.586 --> 00:28:42.336 A:middle
in the screenshots exactly the
experience that they're going

00:28:42.336 --> 00:28:43.756 A:middle
to get when they
download this app.

00:28:43.996 --> 00:28:45.806 A:middle
This is exactly what
users expect to see.

00:28:46.206 --> 00:28:47.416 A:middle
So take advantage of the fact

00:28:47.416 --> 00:28:50.506 A:middle
that you can upload
localized names, descriptions,

00:28:50.506 --> 00:28:54.516 A:middle
and screenshots to
the App Store.

00:28:55.026 --> 00:28:59.156 A:middle
And lastly, I wanted to talk
about surprise and delight.

00:28:59.296 --> 00:29:03.166 A:middle
What you can do to go above and
beyond to make a great product

00:28:59.296 --> 00:29:03.166 A:middle
What you can do to go above and
beyond to make a great product

00:29:03.166 --> 00:29:07.396 A:middle
for people in the --
using a specific language

00:29:07.396 --> 00:29:08.446 A:middle
or in a specific country.

00:29:09.856 --> 00:29:10.946 A:middle
I'll give a couple of examples.

00:29:11.376 --> 00:29:15.786 A:middle
One is if you have any
kind of predefined content

00:29:15.786 --> 00:29:18.966 A:middle
such as templates and pages.

00:29:20.196 --> 00:29:24.576 A:middle
You could create
different customized content

00:29:24.576 --> 00:29:25.616 A:middle
for different languages.

00:29:26.076 --> 00:29:30.316 A:middle
And so for example, in Pages
you have custom templates

00:29:30.316 --> 00:29:32.026 A:middle
for cards for some languages.

00:29:33.966 --> 00:29:37.456 A:middle
And just one more
example I'll give is

00:29:37.496 --> 00:29:40.746 A:middle
for more advanced feature,
let's say you're supporting --

00:29:41.146 --> 00:29:44.266 A:middle
you're a calendar app, and you
want to have a really great app

00:29:44.366 --> 00:29:48.456 A:middle
for the Middle East and also
for a lot of Asian countries

00:29:48.716 --> 00:29:51.806 A:middle
like China where they
use a lunar calendar.

00:29:51.986 --> 00:29:54.146 A:middle
Well, you could support
the lunar calendar

00:29:54.196 --> 00:29:58.236 A:middle
in your calendar app just like
iOS does and iOS and OS X do

00:29:59.006 --> 00:30:02.856 A:middle
because this is going to
deliver a much richer experience

00:29:59.006 --> 00:30:02.856 A:middle
because this is going to
deliver a much richer experience

00:30:03.006 --> 00:30:04.006 A:middle
for those users.

00:30:05.156 --> 00:30:07.186 A:middle
Now what your app
does is really --

00:30:07.186 --> 00:30:09.236 A:middle
depends on what your app does.

00:30:09.706 --> 00:30:12.276 A:middle
And so you need to take a
look at your own app and see

00:30:12.276 --> 00:30:16.476 A:middle
if there's an area where you can
deliver a surprise to the user.

00:30:17.676 --> 00:30:21.086 A:middle
That's really all I
wanted to talk about today.

00:30:21.196 --> 00:30:27.326 A:middle
So in summary, localize
your app.

00:30:27.916 --> 00:30:31.346 A:middle
Use standard system APIs
like Formatter and Bundle.

00:30:31.936 --> 00:30:37.596 A:middle
Make sure that the apps' layout
is flexible and works well

00:30:37.596 --> 00:30:39.366 A:middle
for languages with
shorter translations,

00:30:39.706 --> 00:30:44.086 A:middle
longer translations, which have
normal -- not normal-sized,

00:30:44.126 --> 00:30:47.336 A:middle
English-sized scripts
or taller scripts.

00:30:50.576 --> 00:30:53.676 A:middle
When designing the
iconography for your app,

00:30:54.416 --> 00:30:56.826 A:middle
make sure that it is
a world-ready design

00:30:56.826 --> 00:31:03.446 A:middle
and doesn't tailor to a
specific language too much.

00:30:56.826 --> 00:31:03.446 A:middle
and doesn't tailor to a
specific language too much.

00:31:04.206 --> 00:31:08.406 A:middle
And finally, at the end
localize your app's name,

00:31:08.406 --> 00:31:10.436 A:middle
if appropriate, and screenshots.

00:31:11.676 --> 00:31:16.276 A:middle
Now for more information,
you can follow this link

00:31:16.596 --> 00:31:18.626 A:middle
to get some other useful links

00:31:19.156 --> 00:31:21.246 A:middle
about internationalization
and localization.

00:31:21.776 --> 00:31:25.906 A:middle
There are also some
really cool other talks

00:31:25.906 --> 00:31:30.816 A:middle
that I mentioned
during my presentation.

00:31:31.066 --> 00:31:32.306 A:middle
So for example, there's
What's New

00:31:32.306 --> 00:31:33.836 A:middle
in International
User Interfaces.

00:31:34.296 --> 00:31:37.086 A:middle
And there's also a
What's New in Auto Layout.

00:31:37.716 --> 00:31:41.256 A:middle
One talk that I wanted to call

00:31:41.256 --> 00:31:43.896 A:middle
out specifically is
Inclusive App Design.

00:31:44.026 --> 00:31:47.776 A:middle
It kind of will talk more about
some of the things I mentioned

00:31:47.776 --> 00:31:53.226 A:middle
at the end about how you can
keep an inclusive design in mind

00:31:53.566 --> 00:31:56.196 A:middle
for both internationalization
and for users

00:31:56.476 --> 00:31:59.266 A:middle
that need accessibility support.

00:32:00.306 --> 00:32:00.786 A:middle
And that's all.

00:32:01.506 --> 00:32:02.206 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:32:03.516 --> 00:32:06.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]
