[ Music ]

00:00:21.116 --> 00:00:22.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome.

00:00:23.076 --> 00:00:24.996 A:middle
I'm Lindsay Verity,
and I'll be joined

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:27.386 A:middle
by my colleagues Casey
Fictum and Eric Hall.

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.506 A:middle
We're here to introduce
a new way

00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:36.086 A:middle
to help people discover
your apps in the App Store.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:40.156 A:middle
If you've developed an app for
iOS, you know how much time,

00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:44.136 A:middle
effort and passion goes into
creating the playful, useful,

00:00:44.136 --> 00:00:45.796 A:middle
and wonderful apps
that people love.

00:00:46.626 --> 00:00:49.406 A:middle
Just like this year's
Apple Design Award winners.

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:53.196 A:middle
You also know that putting
effort into putting awareness

00:00:53.196 --> 00:00:55.806 A:middle
and discoverability
of your app is just

00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:56.876 A:middle
as crucial to its success.

00:00:57.846 --> 00:00:59.876 A:middle
And that's what we're here
to talk to you about today.

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:01.396 A:middle
But before we do that,

00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:04.226 A:middle
let's review all the ways a user
can currently discover your app

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:05.056 A:middle
in the App Store.

00:01:06.036 --> 00:01:09.836 A:middle
There's featured app collections
curated by our editors

00:01:09.906 --> 00:01:13.866 A:middle
that showcase the best apps
based on themes, interests,

00:01:14.056 --> 00:01:16.966 A:middle
and seasonal or cultural events.

00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:20.806 A:middle
Categories where
users can browse

00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:23.066 A:middle
and explore apps
on a deeper level.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:28.986 A:middle
Top Charts, which list the
App Store's bestselling

00:01:28.986 --> 00:01:32.556 A:middle
or most downloaded apps and
games organized by paid,

00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:34.526 A:middle
free, and top-grossing.

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:39.686 A:middle
And whilst editorial
features are an amazing way

00:01:39.686 --> 00:01:42.166 A:middle
to get a quick burst of
awareness in download activity

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:45.056 A:middle
by users with over a
million and a half apps

00:01:45.226 --> 00:01:48.376 A:middle
in the U.S. App Store, the most
sustained source of downloads

00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:50.976 A:middle
for your app as if it shows up
for relevant search results.

00:01:54.676 --> 00:01:56.826 A:middle
Now the best way to
improve discoverability

00:01:56.826 --> 00:01:59.006 A:middle
and the likelihood a user
will tap on your listing

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:01.876 A:middle
in App Store Search, is
to optimize the metadata

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:01.876 A:middle
in App Store Search, is
to optimize the metadata

00:02:01.876 --> 00:02:03.136 A:middle
for your product page.

00:02:03.726 --> 00:02:09.866 A:middle
And show your app name,
imagery, description,

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:12.546 A:middle
and keywords are highly
relevant and appealing.

00:02:13.496 --> 00:02:15.866 A:middle
This should be the prime
focus of your efforts

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:22.556 A:middle
to support your app's
discoverability and downloads.

00:02:23.136 --> 00:02:27.096 A:middle
Last week, we announced Search
Ads, a powerful new way for you

00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:29.436 A:middle
to control the visibility
of your app

00:02:29.546 --> 00:02:30.986 A:middle
in App Store search results.

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:34.646 A:middle
Search Ads can help develop
and drive new downloads

00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:38.956 A:middle
and increase usage
for your apps.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:43.746 A:middle
Almost two-thirds of all
app downloads come directly

00:02:43.806 --> 00:02:45.046 A:middle
from searches on the App Store.

00:02:46.146 --> 00:02:49.676 A:middle
The App Store is the place where
people can proactively look

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:52.586 A:middle
for an app to download,
so there's no better place

00:02:52.586 --> 00:02:56.366 A:middle
to invest in the
promotion of your app.

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:00.356 A:middle
When a user searches
in the App Store,

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:00.356 A:middle
When a user searches
in the App Store,

00:03:00.706 --> 00:03:03.566 A:middle
a single sponsored ad
may appear at the top

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:04.766 A:middle
of the search results.

00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:08.236 A:middle
The sponsored listing will
have a blue background

00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:10.716 A:middle
and ad icon next to
the developer name.

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:14.826 A:middle
The app may be in one of
the formats you see here,

00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:17.766 A:middle
optimized to what
we learn works best

00:03:17.766 --> 00:03:22.006 A:middle
for that search query and user.

00:03:23.186 --> 00:03:25.976 A:middle
Because user experience
is so important to us,

00:03:26.676 --> 00:03:29.646 A:middle
relevance is the main factor
determining whether your ad will

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:30.846 A:middle
be showed for search query.

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:34.336 A:middle
If your app is not relevant to
what the user is looking for,

00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:36.996 A:middle
it will not appear in
the ad spot regardless

00:03:36.996 --> 00:03:38.576 A:middle
of how much you may
be willing to pay.

00:03:39.916 --> 00:03:40.986 A:middle
Let me give you an example.

00:03:41.126 --> 00:03:46.426 A:middle
You have a pizza delivery app
and you bid on gaming searches

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:49.316 A:middle
because you think those
hard-core gamers will get too

00:03:49.316 --> 00:03:51.026 A:middle
engrossed to actually
go out for pizza.

00:03:52.126 --> 00:03:55.156 A:middle
Well, your app most likely will
not make it into the auction

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:59.766 A:middle
for those searches because
it is not a gaming app.

00:04:00.086 --> 00:04:05.256 A:middle
Now relevance will be determined
in some parts from the content

00:04:05.256 --> 00:04:06.986 A:middle
of your App Store metadata.

00:04:06.986 --> 00:04:10.216 A:middle
So as I mentioned earlier,
investing your time

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:13.536 A:middle
in thoughtfully crafting
your app title, description,

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:17.046 A:middle
and metadata with the most
relevant keywords will not only

00:04:17.046 --> 00:04:18.555 A:middle
improve your organic presence,

00:04:18.866 --> 00:04:20.685 A:middle
it will also improve
your relevance

00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:23.776 A:middle
for sponsored ads as well.

00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:27.276 A:middle
We also take users'
response to specific ads

00:04:27.276 --> 00:04:28.636 A:middle
as a signal for its relevance.

00:04:29.556 --> 00:04:36.736 A:middle
If users don't respond to an ad,
we'll stop showing it to them.

00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:39.776 A:middle
Pricing is a Cost Per Tap model.

00:04:39.856 --> 00:04:42.646 A:middle
So you only pay when a
user engages with your ad,

00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:45.256 A:middle
and you decide the maximum
amount you're willing

00:04:45.256 --> 00:04:46.046 A:middle
to pay for a tap.

00:04:47.406 --> 00:04:51.036 A:middle
The actual cost of
that tap is a result

00:04:51.036 --> 00:04:52.406 A:middle
of a Second Price Auction,

00:04:52.406 --> 00:04:54.646 A:middle
meaning the price
you pay is based

00:04:54.646 --> 00:04:57.096 A:middle
on what your nearest
competitor is willing to pay

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:59.776 A:middle
to show their ad up
to your maximum bid.

00:05:00.616 --> 00:05:02.956 A:middle
This means you'll never pay more
than you're willing to spend

00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:06.466 A:middle
or more than you need to.

00:05:07.576 --> 00:05:10.766 A:middle
And whether your ad will
be shown is the combination

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:14.066 A:middle
of your app's relevance to the
search query and the amount

00:05:14.066 --> 00:05:15.226 A:middle
of your bid comparative

00:05:15.226 --> 00:05:16.996 A:middle
to others bidding
on that same query.

00:05:18.006 --> 00:05:19.406 A:middle
And as I said earlier, apps

00:05:19.546 --> 00:05:22.686 A:middle
that aren't relevant won't
be entered into the auction.

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:31.616 A:middle
With App Store Search being the
single most important source

00:05:31.616 --> 00:05:34.506 A:middle
of app downloads, our goal
in designing Search Ads was

00:05:34.766 --> 00:05:37.166 A:middle
to give all developers
the opportunity

00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:40.916 A:middle
to reach more customers through
greater control of your presence

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:42.146 A:middle
in relevant search results.

00:05:42.606 --> 00:05:44.966 A:middle
Whether you have a
large budget or small,

00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:47.656 A:middle
have marketing expertise
or none at all.

00:05:48.856 --> 00:05:50.586 A:middle
I now invite Casey
to tell you more

00:05:50.586 --> 00:05:52.056 A:middle
about the features
we've designed

00:05:52.056 --> 00:05:56.066 A:middle
into the product
to do just that.

00:05:56.276 --> 00:05:58.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We've worked hard to make
Search Ad the great product

00:05:58.746 --> 00:05:59.716 A:middle
for all developers.

00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:02.376 A:middle
But we really thought a lot
about how to make the experience

00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:02.376 A:middle
But we really thought a lot
about how to make the experience

00:06:02.376 --> 00:06:04.526 A:middle
for smaller developers
as efficient

00:06:04.526 --> 00:06:05.666 A:middle
and as simple as possible.

00:06:06.216 --> 00:06:08.516 A:middle
So that way you can get back
to doing what you love to do,

00:06:08.516 --> 00:06:09.916 A:middle
which is creating great apps.

00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:13.666 A:middle
Search Ads was designed
to be smart and flexible

00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:15.486 A:middle
so that you can get
your ads up and running

00:06:15.486 --> 00:06:16.506 A:middle
in a matter of minutes.

00:06:17.306 --> 00:06:19.806 A:middle
And there are only a
few things that you need

00:06:19.806 --> 00:06:22.006 A:middle
to tell us before you can
get a campaign to go live.

00:06:22.546 --> 00:06:24.526 A:middle
And that is, your
app, your budget,

00:06:24.826 --> 00:06:25.946 A:middle
and your payment information.

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:27.206 A:middle
And that's it.

00:06:27.396 --> 00:06:29.596 A:middle
So let's talk about
how this works.

00:06:30.136 --> 00:06:32.836 A:middle
You tell us the app that
you want to promote,

00:06:33.096 --> 00:06:35.456 A:middle
and Search Ads will
automatically create an ad

00:06:35.456 --> 00:06:37.956 A:middle
for you using the
metadata and imagery

00:06:37.956 --> 00:06:40.266 A:middle
that you've already provided
in your App Store listing.

00:06:40.716 --> 00:06:44.136 A:middle
So there's actually nothing for
you to do here except make sure

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:47.006 A:middle
that your App Store information
is the best representation

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:48.166 A:middle
of your app.

00:06:48.856 --> 00:06:52.156 A:middle
Now because we know so much
about your app and a genre,

00:06:52.366 --> 00:06:55.436 A:middle
we can then take that ad and
match it to relevant queries

00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:56.726 A:middle
that are coming through
in the app store.

00:06:57.036 --> 00:06:59.826 A:middle
We do this with our default
on search match feature,

00:07:00.146 --> 00:07:01.976 A:middle
and we absolutely
love this feature.

00:07:02.236 --> 00:07:05.316 A:middle
We really think that
you will too.

00:07:05.566 --> 00:07:06.986 A:middle
Next you'll define your budget.

00:07:07.586 --> 00:07:09.916 A:middle
Your budget can include
a daily spend cap.

00:07:10.306 --> 00:07:13.116 A:middle
You'll also tell us the maximum
amount that you're willing

00:07:13.116 --> 00:07:14.516 A:middle
to pay for a tap on your ad.

00:07:15.216 --> 00:07:19.256 A:middle
Eric will talk about how to best
set your Max Cost per Tap later

00:07:19.256 --> 00:07:20.186 A:middle
on in the presentation.

00:07:21.576 --> 00:07:23.776 A:middle
Finally, you add your
payment information.

00:07:24.596 --> 00:07:27.366 A:middle
We support all of the currencies
that you see listed here

00:07:27.796 --> 00:07:29.516 A:middle
and except all major
credit cards.

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:32.166 A:middle
And that's it.

00:07:32.736 --> 00:07:34.776 A:middle
Your ad is now eligible
to be up and running

00:07:34.776 --> 00:07:36.056 A:middle
in App Store Search results.

00:07:36.526 --> 00:07:37.356 A:middle
That's pretty simple.

00:07:38.806 --> 00:07:42.676 A:middle
Now we realize there are some of
you with more time or experience

00:07:42.676 --> 00:07:43.936 A:middle
when it comes to
search marketing,

00:07:44.036 --> 00:07:46.396 A:middle
and you may want more
control over your campaigns.

00:07:46.756 --> 00:07:49.346 A:middle
Now whether that be choosing
the particular keywords

00:07:49.346 --> 00:07:52.176 A:middle
that you want your ad to show
against, setting individual bits

00:07:52.176 --> 00:07:54.766 A:middle
for those keywords, or
just telling us more

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:56.366 A:middle
about a particular
audience that you're trying

00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:57.196 A:middle
to reach with your ad.

00:07:58.056 --> 00:07:59.126 A:middle
Well, you can do all that.

00:07:59.216 --> 00:08:00.816 A:middle
Let's talk about keywords first.

00:07:59.216 --> 00:08:00.816 A:middle
Let's talk about keywords first.

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:05.286 A:middle
Now because we know so much
about your app in a genre,

00:08:05.676 --> 00:08:08.406 A:middle
we can provide a list of
keyword recommendations to you

00:08:08.646 --> 00:08:11.326 A:middle
so that you don't have to think
about all of the possibilities.

00:08:12.356 --> 00:08:15.396 A:middle
Furthermore, you can add
keyword ideas of your own,

00:08:15.686 --> 00:08:20.426 A:middle
and we'll give you a list of
keywords related to that input.

00:08:21.816 --> 00:08:23.106 A:middle
For all of our keywords,

00:08:23.106 --> 00:08:26.866 A:middle
we offer what we call a relative
search term popularity index.

00:08:27.116 --> 00:08:28.746 A:middle
And this just give
you a good idea

00:08:28.746 --> 00:08:31.896 A:middle
of how important a particular
keyword may be for your app

00:08:32.236 --> 00:08:36.746 A:middle
but also the relative
volume that it could drive.

00:08:36.936 --> 00:08:39.035 A:middle
We have two match
types for keywords.

00:08:40.155 --> 00:08:43.015 A:middle
There's Broad match, which
will match you to that keyword

00:08:43.015 --> 00:08:47.076 A:middle
as well as its relative variance
like synonyms and phrases

00:08:47.076 --> 00:08:48.166 A:middle
that include that keyword.

00:08:48.256 --> 00:08:51.286 A:middle
And then there's Exact
match which will target

00:08:51.286 --> 00:08:54.266 A:middle
that specific phrase as
well as its close variance

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:56.486 A:middle
like common misspellings
and plurals.

00:08:56.956 --> 00:08:59.226 A:middle
If you want to learn
more about match types,

00:08:59.226 --> 00:09:00.236 A:middle
you should come talk to us

00:08:59.226 --> 00:09:00.236 A:middle
you should come talk to us

00:09:00.236 --> 00:09:02.706 A:middle
in our lab session tomorrow
morning, and we'll tell you all

00:09:02.706 --> 00:09:04.126 A:middle
about how these work
in our product.

00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:07.476 A:middle
Now you can keep
things simple here.

00:09:07.476 --> 00:09:10.786 A:middle
And you could set a default bid
across all of your keywords,

00:09:11.146 --> 00:09:14.216 A:middle
or you can apply individual
bids at the keyword level

00:09:14.376 --> 00:09:16.236 A:middle
and that would be if you
want to further optimize

00:09:16.236 --> 00:09:18.816 A:middle
that keyword based on
things like its popularity

00:09:19.066 --> 00:09:22.086 A:middle
or just how important that
keyword is for your app.

00:09:23.556 --> 00:09:26.526 A:middle
There are also additional
targeting options available

00:09:26.526 --> 00:09:28.976 A:middle
to you if appropriate
for your app and goals.

00:09:29.426 --> 00:09:32.506 A:middle
Now our default setting is
to not show your ad to users

00:09:32.506 --> 00:09:34.256 A:middle
that have already
downloaded your app.

00:09:34.586 --> 00:09:37.536 A:middle
That way your budget can focus
on acquiring new downloads.

00:09:38.376 --> 00:09:40.856 A:middle
However, if your campaign
goals are different,

00:09:41.396 --> 00:09:46.286 A:middle
you can target existing users as
well as users of your other app.

00:09:46.546 --> 00:09:49.226 A:middle
If you want to further refine
your audience, we do allow you

00:09:49.226 --> 00:09:52.436 A:middle
to target by things like gender,
age, and device location.

00:09:53.416 --> 00:09:56.426 A:middle
So a very simple way to use
this feature would be let's say

00:09:56.426 --> 00:09:59.466 A:middle
that you have an app that
only services certain cities.

00:10:00.916 --> 00:10:02.976 A:middle
Well, you could target
by device location

00:10:03.146 --> 00:10:05.776 A:middle
and that way you wouldn't
be wasting budget in cities

00:10:05.776 --> 00:10:06.966 A:middle
that your app doesn't service.

00:10:08.426 --> 00:10:10.506 A:middle
Or perhaps there's an
age and gender group

00:10:10.506 --> 00:10:12.806 A:middle
that you know is your
most valuable customer.

00:10:13.576 --> 00:10:16.116 A:middle
Let's say males, ages 18 to 34.

00:10:16.506 --> 00:10:18.506 A:middle
Well, you could create
a discreet ad group

00:10:18.566 --> 00:10:21.286 A:middle
that would allow you to closely
manage the exposure and bids,

00:10:21.286 --> 00:10:22.666 A:middle
then, for that audience.

00:10:23.286 --> 00:10:28.536 A:middle
Now we obviously want you
to understand your return

00:10:28.536 --> 00:10:29.916 A:middle
on investment in Search Ads.

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:33.356 A:middle
But we want that to be a very
clean and easy process for you.

00:10:33.856 --> 00:10:37.216 A:middle
So we designed an
intuitive campaign management

00:10:37.216 --> 00:10:40.446 A:middle
and reporting UI that will allow
you to get a quick overview

00:10:40.446 --> 00:10:42.886 A:middle
of what's happening,
as well as easily drill

00:10:42.886 --> 00:10:44.976 A:middle
down into the details
and management if needed.

00:10:44.976 --> 00:10:47.766 A:middle
Now the best place to
get a high-level overview

00:10:47.766 --> 00:10:48.896 A:middle
of performance is

00:10:48.896 --> 00:10:51.586 A:middle
on the campaign overview
page, which you see here.

00:10:51.696 --> 00:10:54.886 A:middle
And this is where we've trended
your most important metrics

00:10:55.126 --> 00:10:57.046 A:middle
in one very easy to digest page.

00:10:58.026 --> 00:11:00.676 A:middle
From here, you could hop
into the Keywords tab.

00:10:58.026 --> 00:11:00.676 A:middle
From here, you could hop
into the Keywords tab.

00:11:00.846 --> 00:11:02.686 A:middle
And you'll see we've
made it easy for you

00:11:02.686 --> 00:11:03.966 A:middle
to optimize those keywords

00:11:04.216 --> 00:11:05.756 A:middle
because we've placed
their key metrics

00:11:05.756 --> 00:11:07.736 A:middle
in the exact same place
that you manage them.

00:11:08.596 --> 00:11:11.436 A:middle
If you have bulk sets of
new keywords or negatives,

00:11:11.436 --> 00:11:13.496 A:middle
which would be the keywords
you don't want your ad

00:11:13.496 --> 00:11:16.366 A:middle
to show against, you can upload
those here via spreadsheet

00:11:16.366 --> 00:11:16.706 A:middle
as well.

00:11:17.646 --> 00:11:19.206 A:middle
Then there's the
Search Terms tab.

00:11:19.206 --> 00:11:21.376 A:middle
And this is a very powerful tab.

00:11:21.506 --> 00:11:24.616 A:middle
You could learn the actual
user search terms that have led

00:11:24.616 --> 00:11:27.076 A:middle
to an impression, tap,
or download for your ad.

00:11:27.276 --> 00:11:28.416 A:middle
So all the search queries

00:11:28.416 --> 00:11:30.266 A:middle
that your ad's been
matched to are shown here.

00:11:30.626 --> 00:11:32.926 A:middle
So anything from that Search
Match feature that I talked

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:35.026 A:middle
about earlier will be
shown in this list.

00:11:35.066 --> 00:11:37.516 A:middle
And you'd also see search
queries that resulted

00:11:37.516 --> 00:11:39.316 A:middle
from your own Broad
match keywords.

00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:42.596 A:middle
So really it's just a great
place to discover new keywords.

00:11:43.166 --> 00:11:48.626 A:middle
Now these management screens
are ideal for taking actions

00:11:48.626 --> 00:11:49.996 A:middle
with performance
context and view.

00:11:50.506 --> 00:11:53.246 A:middle
But we've also built a
powerful reporting section

00:11:53.516 --> 00:11:55.976 A:middle
that allows you to parse
your campaigns, ad groups

00:11:55.976 --> 00:11:58.326 A:middle
and keywords by things
like demo,

00:11:58.386 --> 00:12:00.096 A:middle
location, device, and more.

00:11:58.386 --> 00:12:00.096 A:middle
location, device, and more.

00:12:01.316 --> 00:12:03.696 A:middle
You can download all of
this data to spreadsheets,

00:12:03.726 --> 00:12:06.406 A:middle
and we also offer
APIs for reporting,

00:12:06.406 --> 00:12:08.226 A:middle
campaign creation,
and management.

00:12:10.106 --> 00:12:11.666 A:middle
Once you've acquired a customer,

00:12:11.946 --> 00:12:14.266 A:middle
we offer a robust
attribution API

00:12:14.446 --> 00:12:17.146 A:middle
to give you advance insights,
including the ability

00:12:17.146 --> 00:12:18.456 A:middle
to understand the keywords

00:12:18.616 --> 00:12:20.996 A:middle
that are delivering the most
valuable customers to you.

00:12:21.436 --> 00:12:23.046 A:middle
That way you can
use that information

00:12:23.046 --> 00:12:25.116 A:middle
to optimize your bidding
strategies accordingly.

00:12:25.776 --> 00:12:28.016 A:middle
And now I'd like to invite Eric

00:12:28.166 --> 00:12:30.386 A:middle
to show you just how
effortless it is to create

00:12:30.386 --> 00:12:32.246 A:middle
and optimize a Search
Ads campaign

00:12:32.426 --> 00:12:34.206 A:middle
in our simple, yet powerful UI.

00:12:38.036 --> 00:12:40.736 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm going to share
with you how to set up

00:12:40.736 --> 00:12:44.536 A:middle
and manage a successful search
campaign in the App Store.

00:12:45.016 --> 00:12:50.496 A:middle
First, I search for my app
that I want to promote.

00:12:50.496 --> 00:12:54.686 A:middle
My app is LightRight, a new
camera app that specializes

00:12:54.686 --> 00:12:57.726 A:middle
in unique filters that aren't
available anywhere else.

00:12:58.496 --> 00:13:02.386 A:middle
Search Ads has found my app
and pulled in all my metadata,

00:12:58.496 --> 00:13:02.386 A:middle
Search Ads has found my app
and pulled in all my metadata,

00:13:02.786 --> 00:13:07.056 A:middle
which it will use to make my
campaign setup quick and easy.

00:13:07.656 --> 00:13:10.996 A:middle
Straight away I can see it has
automatically created my ad

00:13:11.176 --> 00:13:13.776 A:middle
for me, and I can
see a sample here.

00:13:14.856 --> 00:13:17.636 A:middle
The first thing I need
to do is name my campaign

00:13:17.636 --> 00:13:18.726 A:middle
and put in my budget.

00:13:19.456 --> 00:13:21.146 A:middle
My budget is $3,000.

00:13:21.706 --> 00:13:25.706 A:middle
I also have the option to
set a maximum daily spend.

00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:28.766 A:middle
I want to pace out my budget
to last for the quarter,

00:13:29.066 --> 00:13:30.746 A:middle
so I'll set it to $50.

00:13:34.016 --> 00:13:36.596 A:middle
Now I need to create
an ad group.

00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:39.636 A:middle
So I can organize my
bids and any keywords

00:13:39.636 --> 00:13:41.416 A:middle
or audience targeting
I want to add.

00:13:41.806 --> 00:13:44.466 A:middle
I'm going to call mine
LightRight Launch Group.

00:13:48.396 --> 00:13:51.876 A:middle
Because Search Ads knows
my app is a universal app,

00:13:52.366 --> 00:13:55.086 A:middle
it has defaulted my ads
to show for searches

00:13:55.086 --> 00:13:57.746 A:middle
on both the iPad and the iPhone.

00:13:58.306 --> 00:14:02.946 A:middle
I have the option to
choose just iPhone or iPad,

00:13:58.306 --> 00:14:02.946 A:middle
I have the option to
choose just iPhone or iPad,

00:14:03.586 --> 00:14:05.866 A:middle
but I want to reach as
many people as possible,

00:14:05.906 --> 00:14:07.326 A:middle
so I'll leave it as is.

00:14:07.896 --> 00:14:13.626 A:middle
If appropriate, I can also
schedule my ad to start

00:14:13.626 --> 00:14:15.546 A:middle
and stop on specific dates.

00:14:15.696 --> 00:14:19.516 A:middle
The default setting is to
start today with no end date.

00:14:20.106 --> 00:14:24.906 A:middle
I can also choose to have my
ad show only on certain days

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.666 A:middle
of the week or times of the day.

00:14:27.246 --> 00:14:30.906 A:middle
But for my LightRight App, I'd
like to be on the same schedule

00:14:30.906 --> 00:14:33.996 A:middle
as the App Store, 24/7.

00:14:34.906 --> 00:14:38.946 A:middle
Importantly, I need to set my
default max Cost Per Tap bid.

00:14:39.996 --> 00:14:44.146 A:middle
To work out how I should
set that for my campaign,

00:14:44.336 --> 00:14:47.716 A:middle
I take what I know an average
customer is worth to me

00:14:47.976 --> 00:14:50.766 A:middle
and decide how much
I can afford to spend

00:14:50.766 --> 00:14:52.756 A:middle
on acquiring each new customer.

00:14:53.506 --> 00:14:56.986 A:middle
I can afford to spend
about $2.50 per customer.

00:14:57.866 --> 00:15:01.276 A:middle
Given that searchers in the
App Store are high-intent

00:14:57.866 --> 00:15:01.276 A:middle
Given that searchers in the
App Store are high-intent

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:05.406 A:middle
downloaders, I'm going to assume
on average that 40 percent

00:15:05.406 --> 00:15:09.896 A:middle
of the people who tap on my ad
will actually download my app.

00:15:09.996 --> 00:15:14.066 A:middle
Doing the math, that means I
can afford to pay 40 percent

00:15:14.426 --> 00:15:18.366 A:middle
of $2.50 per tap or $1.

00:15:19.756 --> 00:15:23.976 A:middle
So I'll set my starting
default max CPT bid to $1.

00:15:31.046 --> 00:15:33.306 A:middle
I have the option to
set a target cost per

00:15:33.306 --> 00:15:34.176 A:middle
acquisition goal.

00:15:34.806 --> 00:15:38.446 A:middle
Search Ads will use this
as a guide to work towards,

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.126 A:middle
but it's not a guarantee.

00:15:40.946 --> 00:15:44.366 A:middle
If I set it too low, I
could be forgoing taps

00:15:44.366 --> 00:15:45.766 A:middle
that may lead to downloads.

00:15:46.436 --> 00:15:48.806 A:middle
For now, I'm not
going to set one

00:15:48.806 --> 00:15:50.986 A:middle
until I have some
learnings from my campaign.

00:15:51.586 --> 00:15:56.426 A:middle
Now I'm moving into defining
how my ads will get seen.

00:15:56.976 --> 00:16:00.106 A:middle
Search Match is on by default,
and I'm going to leave it

00:15:56.976 --> 00:16:00.106 A:middle
Search Match is on by default,
and I'm going to leave it

00:16:00.106 --> 00:16:01.966 A:middle
on because as Casey mentioned,

00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:05.106 A:middle
Search Match will
automatically match my ad

00:16:05.266 --> 00:16:07.106 A:middle
to relevant user searches.

00:16:08.006 --> 00:16:11.516 A:middle
If I want to keep things simple,
I can just rely on Search Match

00:16:11.516 --> 00:16:12.956 A:middle
to do all of the work for me.

00:16:14.176 --> 00:16:16.886 A:middle
Because as I have time and
some previous experience

00:16:16.886 --> 00:16:19.006 A:middle
with search campaigns, I'm going

00:16:19.006 --> 00:16:21.486 A:middle
to see what keywords are
being recommended to me.

00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:27.546 A:middle
All of these look good, so I'm
going to go ahead and add them.

00:16:28.176 --> 00:16:30.606 A:middle
I can also see that some
of the recommendations

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:33.756 A:middle
such as picture editor
look very popular.

00:16:34.276 --> 00:16:37.936 A:middle
I'll want to keep a
close eye on that one.

00:16:38.126 --> 00:16:41.326 A:middle
I also have a few keywords that
I'd like to add to my list.

00:16:41.896 --> 00:16:46.056 A:middle
As Casey mentioned,
when I use brackets,

00:16:46.056 --> 00:16:48.936 A:middle
then it's considered an
exact match and the rest

00:16:48.936 --> 00:16:50.226 A:middle
of the words are broad match.

00:16:52.616 --> 00:16:56.056 A:middle
So LightRight is an exact
match and color change

00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:57.916 A:middle
in light conditions
are broad match.

00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:01.566 A:middle
I have the option to
change the bids if I want.

00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:01.566 A:middle
I have the option to
change the bids if I want.

00:17:02.056 --> 00:17:03.826 A:middle
But I plan to leave
them as-is for now.

00:17:04.205 --> 00:17:09.406 A:middle
Advanced targeting
offers me several options

00:17:09.406 --> 00:17:12.675 A:middle
to refine the audience
for my ad if appropriate

00:17:12.675 --> 00:17:13.876 A:middle
for my particular app.

00:17:14.486 --> 00:17:18.036 A:middle
The first default setting is
to show my ad only to users

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:20.266 A:middle
who have not downloaded my app.

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:24.986 A:middle
Other options, such as
reengaging my existing users are

00:17:24.986 --> 00:17:26.136 A:middle
also open to me.

00:17:26.566 --> 00:17:30.686 A:middle
But in my case, LightRight is a
new app, and I'm really focused

00:17:30.686 --> 00:17:32.156 A:middle
on acquiring new users.

00:17:32.576 --> 00:17:34.226 A:middle
So I'll go with the
default setting.

00:17:35.066 --> 00:17:38.526 A:middle
If appropriate, I could
also target my ads to show

00:17:38.526 --> 00:17:40.426 A:middle
to a specific gender or age.

00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:44.926 A:middle
For example, if your app is
a young women's fashion app,

00:17:44.926 --> 00:17:48.446 A:middle
then you may target female
ages between 18 and 34.

00:17:48.906 --> 00:17:51.596 A:middle
But for my LightRight
app all ages

00:17:52.016 --> 00:17:55.186 A:middle
and genders would be excited
to use my low-light filters,

00:17:55.426 --> 00:17:57.716 A:middle
so I'll skip the
demographic targeting.

00:18:00.056 --> 00:18:03.256 A:middle
Device location can be a
useful targeting option

00:18:03.256 --> 00:18:06.786 A:middle
if your app only serves a
specific geographical area.

00:18:07.526 --> 00:18:10.756 A:middle
For example, a food delivery
app that only serves the area

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:13.956 A:middle
around San Francisco might
want to use this feature.

00:18:14.566 --> 00:18:20.016 A:middle
Now that I've set up my initial
campaign, let's fast forward

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:22.996 A:middle
into the future and
see my campaign trends.

00:18:24.196 --> 00:18:28.146 A:middle
My average cost per tap at
86 cents is below my $1 max.

00:18:28.716 --> 00:18:32.406 A:middle
And my average cost per
acquisition is $2.34,

00:18:32.726 --> 00:18:34.686 A:middle
below my $2.50 target.

00:18:35.256 --> 00:18:38.116 A:middle
My average conversion rate
is on track at 40 percent.

00:18:38.736 --> 00:18:41.126 A:middle
At a high level, these
metrics look good.

00:18:41.706 --> 00:18:43.456 A:middle
But I notice my impressions,
taps,

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:44.776 A:middle
and conversions have flattened

00:18:45.216 --> 00:18:46.896 A:middle
and are starting
to trend downward.

00:18:47.566 --> 00:18:51.726 A:middle
Given that my CPT and CPA
are below my expected values,

00:18:51.946 --> 00:18:54.646 A:middle
there may be opportunity for
me to win more impressions.

00:18:55.266 --> 00:18:57.446 A:middle
Let's drill down into
the search term view

00:18:57.446 --> 00:18:58.436 A:middle
to see what's happening.

00:18:58.986 --> 00:19:01.466 A:middle
To get there, I click
on the Keyword tab

00:18:58.986 --> 00:19:01.466 A:middle
To get there, I click
on the Keyword tab

00:19:01.466 --> 00:19:02.666 A:middle
and then on Search Term.

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:06.436 A:middle
The Search Term view is where I
can discover the actual search

00:19:06.436 --> 00:19:10.226 A:middle
terms that match to my ad
along with my key metrics

00:19:10.226 --> 00:19:11.236 A:middle
and their performance.

00:19:11.916 --> 00:19:15.416 A:middle
I can see here that
Search Match is matching me

00:19:15.416 --> 00:19:17.206 A:middle
to some really relevant terms

00:19:17.336 --> 00:19:19.786 A:middle
that are increasing
traffic to my app.

00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:23.516 A:middle
Color edit search term is
driving a lot of downloads

00:19:23.516 --> 00:19:26.386 A:middle
from my app at a
very efficient CPA.

00:19:26.736 --> 00:19:28.836 A:middle
I want to see if I can
get more impressions

00:19:28.836 --> 00:19:31.076 A:middle
if I raise my max CPT bid.

00:19:31.406 --> 00:19:34.666 A:middle
So I'm going to add it
as a broad match keyword.

00:19:44.066 --> 00:19:47.986 A:middle
I'm going to up my
max bid to $1.25.

00:19:52.296 --> 00:19:54.466 A:middle
Color search term,
on the other hand,

00:19:54.466 --> 00:19:57.366 A:middle
is driving very few
downloads and has a high CPA.

00:19:57.366 --> 00:20:01.436 A:middle
It's a broad match to
my color change keyword.

00:19:57.366 --> 00:20:01.436 A:middle
It's a broad match to
my color change keyword.

00:20:01.986 --> 00:20:05.026 A:middle
So I'm going to add it as a
negative exact match keyword

00:20:05.026 --> 00:20:09.286 A:middle
as people searching color are
not finding it too relevant

00:20:14.176 --> 00:20:14.896 A:middle
to my app.

00:20:14.896 --> 00:20:17.246 A:middle
Let's add color as a
negative campaign keyword.

00:20:19.456 --> 00:20:22.206 A:middle
To learn and manage
the performance

00:20:22.206 --> 00:20:26.116 A:middle
of the keywords I specifically
targeted, I need to hop

00:20:26.116 --> 00:20:30.196 A:middle
over to the Manage Keyword tab.

00:20:30.356 --> 00:20:33.586 A:middle
I see that app for lighting
has a low conversion rate

00:20:33.586 --> 00:20:38.206 A:middle
and the CPA at $5.17 is a
lot higher than my goal.

00:20:38.756 --> 00:20:42.966 A:middle
I'm going to pause the app
for lighting keyword for now.

00:20:50.306 --> 00:20:52.556 A:middle
I like the picture
editor keyword,

00:20:52.746 --> 00:20:54.556 A:middle
as that is performing
really well.

00:20:54.926 --> 00:20:57.856 A:middle
So I'm going to use
the Add Keywords tool

00:20:57.856 --> 00:21:00.956 A:middle
to get recommendations for
more keywords like this one.

00:20:57.856 --> 00:21:00.956 A:middle
to get recommendations for
more keywords like this one.

00:21:05.656 --> 00:21:07.646 A:middle
So let's type in picture editor.

00:21:12.036 --> 00:21:14.236 A:middle
The photo editor
keyword is popular.

00:21:14.756 --> 00:21:17.996 A:middle
That should drive relevant
traffic to my LightRight app.

00:21:17.996 --> 00:21:20.426 A:middle
I'll add it to my
manage keywords.

00:21:20.966 --> 00:21:24.666 A:middle
And it will show up at
the top of the table.

00:21:25.236 --> 00:21:30.226 A:middle
The reporting view is a great
way to discover insights

00:21:30.226 --> 00:21:32.706 A:middle
about your campaigns
with various dimensions.

00:21:33.236 --> 00:21:35.936 A:middle
In my case, we're looking
at the distribution

00:21:35.936 --> 00:21:38.416 A:middle
of device class and impressions.

00:21:39.516 --> 00:21:42.176 A:middle
It seems that 80 percent
of users are searching

00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:43.926 A:middle
for my app from an iPhone.

00:21:44.326 --> 00:21:47.256 A:middle
Therefore, I should consider
creating an ad group specific

00:21:47.256 --> 00:21:50.366 A:middle
for iPhone so that I can
further refine my bids

00:21:50.366 --> 00:21:52.706 A:middle
to get more impressions
from iPhone users.

00:21:53.226 --> 00:21:57.596 A:middle
Now I'm driving users to my
app and generating downloads.

00:21:57.696 --> 00:21:58.596 A:middle
That's great.

00:21:59.036 --> 00:22:00.376 A:middle
But knowing the true value

00:21:59.036 --> 00:22:00.376 A:middle
But knowing the true value

00:22:00.376 --> 00:22:03.406 A:middle
of these downloads will help
me understand the full return

00:22:03.606 --> 00:22:05.166 A:middle
on my campaign investment.

00:22:05.886 --> 00:22:08.896 A:middle
Because Search Ads, the App
Store, and the code I've used

00:22:08.896 --> 00:22:12.646 A:middle
to develop my app are all
part of the same ecosystem.

00:22:12.976 --> 00:22:16.066 A:middle
It's easy to know which of
my downloads were generated

00:22:16.066 --> 00:22:16.946 A:middle
by Search Ads.

00:22:17.446 --> 00:22:20.636 A:middle
The Search Ads attribution
API will not only attribute

00:22:20.636 --> 00:22:24.476 A:middle
downloads to my campaign, but
I can also attribute a download

00:22:24.476 --> 00:22:27.346 A:middle
to a specific bidded keyword
and the download date.

00:22:28.126 --> 00:22:31.276 A:middle
It's a turnkey solution that
makes it simple for me to create

00:22:31.496 --> 00:22:33.766 A:middle
and track meaningful
clusters of users

00:22:33.796 --> 00:22:35.476 A:middle
and their value to me over time.

00:22:35.886 --> 00:22:38.636 A:middle
This information will help
me determine which keywords

00:22:38.636 --> 00:22:41.956 A:middle
and other targeting parameters
work the best for my app.

00:22:42.086 --> 00:22:43.896 A:middle
And I can use those insights

00:22:43.896 --> 00:22:46.156 A:middle
to optimize my campaign
accordingly.

00:22:47.006 --> 00:22:50.006 A:middle
The best part about the
attribution API is how easy it

00:22:50.006 --> 00:22:50.906 A:middle
is to instrument.

00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:54.936 A:middle
You just need the ad -- the I
Ad framework to your project

00:22:54.936 --> 00:22:57.736 A:middle
and then add these lines of
code to your application.

00:22:58.716 --> 00:23:01.236 A:middle
Here's the response object
from the attribution API

00:22:58.716 --> 00:23:01.236 A:middle
Here's the response object
from the attribution API

00:23:01.236 --> 00:23:03.876 A:middle
that contains campaign
hierarchy, details,

00:23:03.876 --> 00:23:06.506 A:middle
download date, and click date.

00:23:06.916 --> 00:23:09.976 A:middle
While the API allows
you to easily analyze

00:23:10.336 --> 00:23:14.496 A:middle
and segment your users, rest
assured that Apple does not sell

00:23:14.496 --> 00:23:17.516 A:middle
or transmit any personal
identifiable information

00:23:17.516 --> 00:23:18.636 A:middle
to any third parties.

00:23:19.086 --> 00:23:22.046 A:middle
We accomplish this by enabling
the information request

00:23:22.046 --> 00:23:26.476 A:middle
and response on device
verifying the developer, user,

00:23:26.476 --> 00:23:28.876 A:middle
customer relationship
and allowing the user

00:23:28.876 --> 00:23:30.236 A:middle
to prevent information look

00:23:30.236 --> 00:23:33.386 A:middle
up by turning limited
ad tracking to on.

00:23:34.516 --> 00:23:38.396 A:middle
Now that you're armed with these
helpful tips, you'll be ready

00:23:38.396 --> 00:23:42.536 A:middle
to set up and manage your
first search campaign.

00:23:43.526 --> 00:23:44.526 A:middle

to discover your amazing apps.

00:23:49.816 --> 00:23:52.576 A:middle
What could be better than the
opportunity for your app to show

00:23:52.576 --> 00:23:55.566 A:middle
up at the top of relevant
searches in the store

00:23:55.566 --> 00:23:59.016 A:middle
that millions of users are
proactively visiting every day?

00:23:59.706 --> 00:24:04.466 A:middle
And connecting those users
directly to download in one tap.

00:23:59.706 --> 00:24:04.466 A:middle
And connecting those users
directly to download in one tap.

00:24:05.746 --> 00:24:08.616 A:middle

campaign can be done in minutes.

and there's an intuitive
campaign management

00:24:15.646 --> 00:24:17.726 A:middle
and reporting UI
that enables you

00:24:17.726 --> 00:24:19.306 A:middle
to quickly view your results.

00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:24.166 A:middle
You're in control of how
much you want to spend.

00:24:24.876 --> 00:24:27.296 A:middle
And you have the option to
manage your own keywords,

00:24:27.776 --> 00:24:31.406 A:middle
refine your targeting, and
use our robust attribution API

00:24:31.756 --> 00:24:33.166 A:middle
for advanced insights.

00:24:37.536 --> 00:24:39.866 A:middle
We've talked about a
lot of things today.

00:24:40.586 --> 00:24:42.986 A:middle
But there are a few things
we've mentioned that you can do

00:24:42.986 --> 00:24:46.036 A:middle
to get prepared for Search Ads.

00:24:46.266 --> 00:24:49.046 A:middle
Firstly, optimize
your app metadata

00:24:49.046 --> 00:24:51.536 A:middle
and ensure it is
a highly relevant

00:24:51.836 --> 00:24:56.556 A:middle
and accurate reflection
of your content.

00:24:56.556 --> 00:24:58.266 A:middle
Understand the value
of your customers

00:24:58.266 --> 00:25:00.416 A:middle
and how much you can
spend to acquire new ones.

00:24:58.266 --> 00:25:00.416 A:middle
and how much you can
spend to acquire new ones.

00:25:00.856 --> 00:25:05.456 A:middle
This will help you determine
your maximum Cost Per Tap bid.

00:25:05.666 --> 00:25:08.466 A:middle
And lastly, implement
the attribution API code

00:25:08.466 --> 00:25:09.136 A:middle
in your app.

00:25:09.626 --> 00:25:12.606 A:middle
You'll love the rich
data it can provide.

00:25:17.046 --> 00:25:19.826 A:middle
