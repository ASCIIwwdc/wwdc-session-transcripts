[ Music ]

00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:22.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome
to our first session

00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:24.096 A:middle
on developing CarPlay Systems.

00:00:24.536 --> 00:00:26.296 A:middle
My name is Emily,
and I'm responsible

00:00:26.296 --> 00:00:28.186 A:middle
for Car Experience
engineering at Apple.

00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:32.526 A:middle
CarPlay was designed from
the ground up as a smarter,

00:00:32.676 --> 00:00:34.766 A:middle
safer way to use your
iPhone in the car.

00:00:35.416 --> 00:00:37.176 A:middle
CarPlay takes the
things you want to do

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:39.636 A:middle
with your iPhone while
driving, and puts them right

00:00:39.636 --> 00:00:41.016 A:middle
on your car's built-in display.

00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:44.436 A:middle
CarPlay brings the
familiar elements

00:00:44.436 --> 00:00:47.376 A:middle
and interaction patterns
of iPhone into your car.

00:00:47.836 --> 00:00:50.366 A:middle
Users already know how
to do things in CarPlay

00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.006 A:middle
because they know how
to use their iPhone.

00:00:54.126 --> 00:00:56.606 A:middle
CarPlay is about more
than just showing iOS

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:57.936 A:middle
on the car's display.

00:00:58.526 --> 00:01:00.126 A:middle
CarPlay is thoughtfully
integrated


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.526 --> 00:01:00.126 A:middle
CarPlay is thoughtfully
integrated

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:01.836 A:middle
with your car's built-in system

00:01:02.116 --> 00:01:04.786 A:middle
to deliver the best
possible user experience.

00:01:06.936 --> 00:01:09.116 A:middle
CarPlay allows you to
design for the future.

00:01:09.696 --> 00:01:11.426 A:middle
With CarPlay, you can
build a car today,

00:01:11.596 --> 00:01:14.306 A:middle
and when Apple introduces
new versions of iOS,

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:17.486 A:middle
users will immediately
benefit from new features.

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:21.086 A:middle
Your car will remain fresh
for years into the future.

00:01:21.986 --> 00:01:25.806 A:middle
Today we'll give you an overview

00:01:25.806 --> 00:01:27.536 A:middle
of how the CarPlay
feature works,

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:30.036 A:middle
and discuss the most
important requirements

00:01:30.036 --> 00:01:30.906 A:middle
for you to consider.

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:34.106 A:middle
We'll explain the user
experience that we want

00:01:34.106 --> 00:01:36.886 A:middle
to enable with CarPlay
and the design guidelines

00:01:36.886 --> 00:01:37.616 A:middle
that we've provided.

00:01:37.616 --> 00:01:44.146 A:middle
At the end, we'll talk about
CarPlay supported apps.

00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:46.636 A:middle
IPhone user interface is
designed to work perfectly

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:49.066 A:middle
when held in the hand, when
you can touch the phone.

00:01:50.886 --> 00:01:53.776 A:middle
CarPlay translates that
user interface to the car,

00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:57.286 A:middle
making it appropriate in that
setting, and safer to use.

00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:01.526 A:middle
It works with what you
already have in your vehicle.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:01.526 A:middle
It works with what you
already have in your vehicle.

00:02:01.916 --> 00:02:03.936 A:middle
It's comfortable to use
in that environment.

00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:09.645 A:middle
Now let's talk about how
CarPlay works in detail.

00:02:11.656 --> 00:02:14.546 A:middle
Let's start with the native
user interface of the vehicle.

00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:21.976 A:middle
When an iPhone is plugged in,
the CarPlay session begins.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.956 A:middle
When a CarPlay session
is brought up,

00:02:25.326 --> 00:02:27.376 A:middle
information is sent
both directions via

00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:29.116 A:middle
communication protocols.

00:02:30.956 --> 00:02:32.846 A:middle
Video can be sent
from the iPhone

00:02:32.846 --> 00:02:35.786 A:middle
to the car as well as audio.

00:02:37.736 --> 00:02:41.266 A:middle
Audio can also be sent from the
car's microphone to the iPhone.

00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:45.436 A:middle
Once a CarPlay session
is established,

00:02:45.716 --> 00:02:48.386 A:middle
different combinations of
these data streams are used.

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:53.006 A:middle
When a CarPlay Home
screen is first shown,

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.196 A:middle
and no audio is playing, the
communication protocols are used

00:02:56.196 --> 00:02:58.166 A:middle
for setup and location
information.

00:02:58.596 --> 00:03:02.246 A:middle
An H264 video stream showing
the Home screen is sent


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.596 --> 00:03:02.246 A:middle
An H264 video stream showing
the Home screen is sent

00:03:02.246 --> 00:03:03.636 A:middle
from the iPhone to the car.

00:03:06.036 --> 00:03:08.166 A:middle
If we then play audio
in CarPlay,

00:03:08.406 --> 00:03:10.986 A:middle
the communication protocols
will additionally be used

00:03:10.986 --> 00:03:12.776 A:middle
to send information
about the playing track.

00:03:12.946 --> 00:03:17.126 A:middle
The video stream here is
encoding the now playing screen,

00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:19.846 A:middle
and audio for the song
is sent to the car.

00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:26.086 A:middle
If the CarPlay UI is exited,
and the car's screen is shown,

00:03:26.446 --> 00:03:28.756 A:middle
the CarPlay session
remains active.

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:32.366 A:middle
The communication protocols
will continue to be used

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:34.646 A:middle
for now playing and
location information.

00:03:35.186 --> 00:03:37.316 A:middle
The video stream is
no longer needed,

00:03:37.686 --> 00:03:39.516 A:middle
but CarPlay audio still plays,

00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:42.506 A:middle
even though CarPlay
video is not shown.

00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:46.076 A:middle
The screen and audio are
controlled independently.

00:03:46.836 --> 00:03:50.606 A:middle
Video from the native system
can be shown while CarPlay audio

00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:51.216 A:middle
is playing.

00:03:51.986 --> 00:03:53.926 A:middle
If the CarPlay interface
were shown,

00:03:54.376 --> 00:04:00.186 A:middle
audio from the native system,
like FM radio, could play.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:54.376 --> 00:04:00.186 A:middle
audio from the native system,
like FM radio, could play.

00:04:00.546 --> 00:04:04.156 A:middle
Let's see what happens if Siri
is then launched using the

00:04:04.156 --> 00:04:05.846 A:middle
push-to-talk steering
wheel button.

00:04:06.786 --> 00:04:09.956 A:middle
The communication protocols will
be used to tell the head unit

00:04:10.176 --> 00:04:12.416 A:middle
that iOS voice recognition
is underway.

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:15.596 A:middle
The CarPlay UI is
sent to the screen,

00:04:15.676 --> 00:04:18.696 A:middle
and the Siri audio chime plays
on the vehicle's speakers.

00:04:19.396 --> 00:04:21.826 A:middle
In this case, audio is also sent

00:04:21.826 --> 00:04:24.836 A:middle
from the car's microphones
to the iPhone.

00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:29.996 A:middle
These examples gave you
a high-level overview

00:04:29.996 --> 00:04:31.416 A:middle
of how CarPlay works.

00:04:33.786 --> 00:04:35.286 A:middle
Now let's look in more detail

00:04:35.286 --> 00:04:37.666 A:middle
at what's happening
in the head unit.

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:42.566 A:middle
For wired CarPlay,
data goes over USB.

00:04:44.446 --> 00:04:46.776 A:middle
All data is wrapped in IP.

00:04:47.776 --> 00:04:50.456 A:middle
Except for the iAP2
communication protocol.

00:04:52.456 --> 00:04:57.696 A:middle
Information from vehicle sensors
is sent over iAP2 as is audio,

00:04:57.876 --> 00:05:00.076 A:middle
telephony, and turn-by-turn
metadata.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:57.876 --> 00:05:00.076 A:middle
telephony, and turn-by-turn
metadata.

00:05:01.876 --> 00:05:05.036 A:middle
The communication plug-in is
source code provided by Apple,

00:05:05.076 --> 00:05:08.986 A:middle
and that receives the incoming
video and audio streams as well

00:05:09.036 --> 00:05:11.056 A:middle
as an additional
communication stream.

00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:16.086 A:middle
The audio and video is sent to
the head unit's infrastructure,

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:19.456 A:middle
connected to the speakers,
microphone, and display.

00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:25.166 A:middle
Control events from the
touchscreen, knob, buttons,

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:26.846 A:middle
or touchpad are sent
to the plug-in.

00:05:26.846 --> 00:05:32.396 A:middle
Now in the case of
wireless CarPlay,

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:34.306 A:middle
much of the system
looks the same.

00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:37.966 A:middle
Both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
are needed.

00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:41.956 A:middle
For wireless, all
data is wrapped in IP.

00:05:43.436 --> 00:05:46.276 A:middle
Connections to the vehicle's
subsystems are the same.

00:05:48.616 --> 00:05:50.976 A:middle
Now that you have a
good understanding

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:52.426 A:middle
of how CarPlay works, we'll go

00:05:52.426 --> 00:05:54.666 A:middle
over the most important
vehicle requirements.

00:05:56.076 --> 00:05:58.266 A:middle
We will talk through
each of these in detail.

00:05:58.606 --> 00:06:01.326 A:middle
We want to make sure you
understand the requirements


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:58.606 --> 00:06:01.326 A:middle
We want to make sure you
understand the requirements

00:06:01.326 --> 00:06:04.576 A:middle
before you begin to design a
system so that you can be sure

00:06:04.576 --> 00:06:06.876 A:middle
that it's capable of
supporting CarPlay.

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:11.776 A:middle
First, the vehicle
needs a great display.

00:06:11.776 --> 00:06:14.446 A:middle
A high-quality display
is critical

00:06:14.446 --> 00:06:15.816 A:middle
to the CarPlay experience.

00:06:17.926 --> 00:06:20.606 A:middle
Several standard display
resolutions are supported,

00:06:20.606 --> 00:06:25.476 A:middle
and those resolutions
are shown here.

00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:28.166 A:middle
Most are approximately 16 by 9.

00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:31.426 A:middle
Extra-wide screens
are also supported.

00:06:32.156 --> 00:06:35.916 A:middle
Today, all supported resolutions
are landscape orientation.

00:06:37.846 --> 00:06:40.926 A:middle
We have support for screens
with varying pixel densities.

00:06:42.856 --> 00:06:46.146 A:middle
Asset sizes in CarPlay have
been adjusted depending

00:06:46.146 --> 00:06:48.006 A:middle
on the resolution of the screen.

00:06:48.906 --> 00:06:51.706 A:middle
So that assets will
appear the same size on low

00:06:51.706 --> 00:06:53.236 A:middle
and high resolution screens.

00:06:54.096 --> 00:06:58.196 A:middle
Without this, icons on the 720
screens would be much smaller.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:00.976 --> 00:07:03.986 A:middle
If you do have a display with
a slightly different resolution

00:07:03.986 --> 00:07:07.006 A:middle
than what was listed here,
please contact Apple to see

00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:08.106 A:middle
if it can be supported.

00:07:09.026 --> 00:07:12.126 A:middle
We require that aftermarket
screens be no smaller

00:07:12.126 --> 00:07:13.086 A:middle
than six inches

00:07:13.376 --> 00:07:15.736 A:middle
since aftermarket
systems could be installed

00:07:15.846 --> 00:07:17.846 A:middle
into a wide variety of vehicles.

00:07:18.756 --> 00:07:21.626 A:middle
There is no minimum for
systems built by automakers.

00:07:22.126 --> 00:07:24.526 A:middle
The automaker has the
responsibility to make sure

00:07:24.526 --> 00:07:27.506 A:middle
that CarPlay is appropriate on
the selected vehicle screen.

00:07:29.806 --> 00:07:32.986 A:middle
I should mention several
additional screen requirements.

00:07:33.376 --> 00:07:35.496 A:middle
Twenty-four bit color
depth is required,

00:07:35.856 --> 00:07:39.426 A:middle
and a 60 hertz refresh rate
is strongly recommended

00:07:39.596 --> 00:07:41.696 A:middle
for a responsive user interface.

00:07:42.276 --> 00:07:45.816 A:middle
Make sure that your H264 decoder
supports the right profile.

00:07:46.246 --> 00:07:47.886 A:middle
This is a hard requirement.

00:07:47.886 --> 00:07:53.466 A:middle
A high-quality display in
the vehicle is critical

00:07:53.466 --> 00:07:55.036 A:middle
to the CarPlay experience.

00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:58.906 A:middle
Let's talk about the car's
audio system and microphones.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:00.576 --> 00:08:02.156 A:middle
CarPlay audio is separated

00:08:02.156 --> 00:08:05.846 A:middle
into two streams main
audio and alternate audio.

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:09.926 A:middle
Main audio is bi-directional,
and it is used for music

00:08:09.926 --> 00:08:12.416 A:middle
and other media plus
phone calls and Siri.

00:08:13.866 --> 00:08:16.016 A:middle
Alternate audio is
used for notifications,

00:08:16.456 --> 00:08:20.686 A:middle
and it must always be mixed by
the head unit with main audio.

00:08:21.146 --> 00:08:24.676 A:middle
If the head unit is playing
audio, like FM radio,

00:08:24.876 --> 00:08:27.046 A:middle
the head unit must
mix alternate audio

00:08:27.046 --> 00:08:29.036 A:middle
from iPhone with that audio.

00:08:31.336 --> 00:08:33.916 A:middle
LPCM is used for wired CarPlay.

00:08:34.576 --> 00:08:37.326 A:middle
Wireless CarPlay
requires compressed audio.

00:08:37.986 --> 00:08:42.246 A:middle
AAC-LC is used for media, and
you have a choice between OPUS

00:08:42.576 --> 00:08:45.636 A:middle
and AAC-ELD for other audio.

00:08:49.456 --> 00:08:52.886 A:middle
CarPlay supports the
various user input devices

00:08:52.886 --> 00:08:53.786 A:middle
in your vehicles.

00:08:55.496 --> 00:08:58.126 A:middle
The CarPlay UI can be
controlled by a touchscreen

00:08:58.126 --> 00:09:02.106 A:middle
on the head unit, by knobs
and buttons, or by a touchpad.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:58.126 --> 00:09:02.106 A:middle
on the head unit, by knobs
and buttons, or by a touchpad.

00:09:02.696 --> 00:09:06.196 A:middle
The Siri button on the steering
wheel is also a critical user

00:09:06.476 --> 00:09:07.336 A:middle
input device.

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:11.456 A:middle
Many vehicles have touchscreens,

00:09:11.456 --> 00:09:12.976 A:middle
and let's talk about
those first.

00:09:13.306 --> 00:09:18.556 A:middle
When the CarPlay UI is active,
and the user touches the screen,

00:09:18.866 --> 00:09:21.246 A:middle
the head unit sends
the iPhone the x,

00:09:21.246 --> 00:09:22.906 A:middle
y coordinates of that touch.

00:09:23.536 --> 00:09:26.616 A:middle
The head unit sends all
touches to the iPhone

00:09:26.616 --> 00:09:28.526 A:middle
when CarPlay is displayed
on the screen.

00:09:29.026 --> 00:09:31.786 A:middle
CarPlay is controlled
with single touches only.

00:09:32.526 --> 00:09:34.736 A:middle
We support two types
of touchscreens,

00:09:34.936 --> 00:09:37.806 A:middle
what we call high-fidelity
and low-fidelity.

00:09:37.986 --> 00:09:42.426 A:middle
High-fidelity touch
systems have low latency.

00:09:42.816 --> 00:09:46.836 A:middle
So swipe gestures that track
the user's finger are allowed.

00:09:48.386 --> 00:09:51.516 A:middle
A high-performance system
is required, however,

00:09:51.656 --> 00:09:55.846 A:middle
one that has less than 140
milliseconds touch latency.

00:09:57.856 --> 00:10:00.706 A:middle
This is how list scrolling
using a swipe gesture


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:57.856 --> 00:10:00.706 A:middle
This is how list scrolling
using a swipe gesture

00:10:00.706 --> 00:10:02.776 A:middle
that tracks the touch
input works

00:10:02.776 --> 00:10:04.586 A:middle
with a high-fidelity
touch system.

00:10:09.046 --> 00:10:12.156 A:middle
Low-fidelity touchscreens
may have higher latency

00:10:12.316 --> 00:10:14.076 A:middle
and are often resistive screens.

00:10:14.836 --> 00:10:18.136 A:middle
Taps control the UI, and
a swipe will not track the

00:10:18.176 --> 00:10:19.206 A:middle
user's finger.

00:10:21.576 --> 00:10:24.386 A:middle
This is how list scrolling
with single taps works

00:10:24.386 --> 00:10:26.226 A:middle
with a low-fidelity
touch system.

00:10:33.046 --> 00:10:36.326 A:middle
Some vehicles use knob,
button, and touchpad controls.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.086 A:middle
Sometimes these are the
main user input devices,

00:10:39.336 --> 00:10:41.756 A:middle
and sometimes they are
secondary to a touchscreen.

00:10:42.316 --> 00:10:44.616 A:middle
All combinations are
supported by CarPlay.

00:10:46.886 --> 00:10:50.406 A:middle
Knobs are supported by the
head unit, sending rotate,

00:10:53.716 --> 00:10:58.286 A:middle
select, and back events.

00:10:58.426 --> 00:11:04.286 A:middle
This is the minimum set
of supported features


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:58.426 --> 00:11:04.286 A:middle
This is the minimum set
of supported features

00:11:04.286 --> 00:11:06.706 A:middle
for a knob that's used
as a primary interface.

00:11:07.226 --> 00:11:09.106 A:middle
Rotate, select, and back.

00:11:10.566 --> 00:11:13.646 A:middle
Some knobs also support
a tilt or nudge feature.

00:11:18.366 --> 00:11:21.146 A:middle
This capability is
supported by the CarPlay UI.

00:11:25.506 --> 00:11:30.436 A:middle
Vehicle touchpads report
x, y coordinates as well

00:11:30.436 --> 00:11:35.056 A:middle
as select and a back button.

00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:41.516 A:middle
If a knob or touchpad
controller is primary,

00:11:41.816 --> 00:11:43.706 A:middle
back and select are required.

00:11:44.476 --> 00:11:48.036 A:middle
Secondary touchpads can also
support character recognition.

00:11:48.586 --> 00:11:52.146 A:middle
Buttons for various functions
such as next, previous,

00:11:52.356 --> 00:11:54.256 A:middle
and telephony functions
are optional.

00:11:56.386 --> 00:11:58.726 A:middle
The CarPlay UI will
automatically change

00:11:58.726 --> 00:12:01.506 A:middle
to match the user inputs
available in the vehicle.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.726 --> 00:12:01.506 A:middle
to match the user inputs
available in the vehicle.

00:12:02.166 --> 00:12:03.816 A:middle
All combinations are possible.

00:12:04.326 --> 00:12:06.856 A:middle
If the main controller
interface is touchscreen,

00:12:07.066 --> 00:12:10.086 A:middle
then combinations
with a knob, touchpad,

00:12:10.086 --> 00:12:12.396 A:middle
or knob plus touchpad
are also possible.

00:12:15.556 --> 00:12:17.826 A:middle
A hard button for
Siri is required.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:22.216 A:middle
Siri is really important
to the CarPlay experience.

00:12:22.216 --> 00:12:25.596 A:middle
The user needs a quick way
to always access Siri even

00:12:25.596 --> 00:12:27.736 A:middle
if the CarPlay UI isn't showing.

00:12:28.286 --> 00:12:30.146 A:middle
Usually this requirement
is satisfied

00:12:30.146 --> 00:12:32.416 A:middle
with a push-to-talk button
on the steering wheel.

00:12:32.416 --> 00:12:34.906 A:middle
For the Siri button, we require

00:12:34.906 --> 00:12:38.256 A:middle
that the head unit send iPhone
all button up/down events

00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:41.846 A:middle
so that interaction during the
Siri conversation is possible.

00:12:42.946 --> 00:12:46.166 A:middle
This wraps up our
discussion on user inputs.

00:12:49.986 --> 00:12:52.396 A:middle
Sensor information is
important to CarPlay.

00:12:54.246 --> 00:12:57.456 A:middle
CarPlay needs location
information from the vehicle

00:12:57.726 --> 00:12:59.676 A:middle
so that the map's
app works well.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:00.276 --> 00:13:03.186 A:middle
Speed and GNSS information
can be provided.

00:13:04.066 --> 00:13:05.956 A:middle
Every vehicle needs
to know its speed.

00:13:06.396 --> 00:13:09.256 A:middle
Speed information is used
by iPhone for dead reckoning

00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:13.056 A:middle
and is critical if the
vehicle does not have a GPS

00:13:13.056 --> 00:13:14.226 A:middle
or GLONASS receiver.

00:13:14.956 --> 00:13:18.086 A:middle
GNSS information includes
latitude and longitude

00:13:18.416 --> 00:13:20.196 A:middle
if the vehicle has
that capability.

00:13:22.866 --> 00:13:26.296 A:middle
Satellite location information
from the vehicle is used

00:13:26.296 --> 00:13:28.196 A:middle
in addition to the
iPhone's sensors

00:13:28.616 --> 00:13:30.446 A:middle
to determine the
location of the user.

00:13:31.216 --> 00:13:33.296 A:middle
This data from the
vehicle may be better

00:13:33.376 --> 00:13:36.056 A:middle
since a larger antenna can
be integrated into the car.

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:38.796 A:middle
This is the recommended
configuration

00:13:38.796 --> 00:13:42.506 A:middle
since it will result in the
best maps user experience.

00:13:43.116 --> 00:13:45.276 A:middle
Sending satellite
location information

00:13:45.276 --> 00:13:46.706 A:middle
to iPhone is required

00:13:46.706 --> 00:13:49.206 A:middle
if the vehicle has the
technology on board.

00:13:50.576 --> 00:13:52.836 A:middle
GNSS information
is also required

00:13:52.836 --> 00:13:55.626 A:middle
for any system supporting
wireless CarPlay

00:13:56.046 --> 00:13:59.406 A:middle
since it's more likely that the
phone will be in a pocket, bag,

00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:02.166 A:middle
or somewhere where the phone
itself has poor reception.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

or somewhere where the phone
itself has poor reception.

00:14:05.576 --> 00:14:07.136 A:middle
What are the requirements

00:14:07.136 --> 00:14:09.336 A:middle
for connecting an
iPhone to the head unit?

00:14:11.896 --> 00:14:15.486 A:middle
Apple CarPlay supports both
wired and wireless connections.

00:14:15.986 --> 00:14:18.476 A:middle
We're excited about the
addition of wireless CarPlay

00:14:18.556 --> 00:14:20.876 A:middle
since it offers a very
convenient experience

00:14:20.876 --> 00:14:21.596 A:middle
for customers.

00:14:22.286 --> 00:14:25.096 A:middle
Users can leave their
phones in pockets and bags,

00:14:25.426 --> 00:14:27.626 A:middle
which is especially
nice on a short drive.

00:14:29.636 --> 00:14:31.696 A:middle
Let's first talk about
wired connections.

00:14:33.356 --> 00:14:36.836 A:middle
USB is used here,
and all audio, video,

00:14:36.836 --> 00:14:38.706 A:middle
and control information
is sent over USB.

00:14:38.706 --> 00:14:43.276 A:middle
Your head unit will need
to support a USB role swap.

00:14:43.276 --> 00:14:47.016 A:middle
The head unit will switch from
a USB host to a USB device.

00:14:47.946 --> 00:14:50.046 A:middle
High throughput is a
requirement, and you'll want

00:14:50.046 --> 00:14:53.106 A:middle
to make sure your USB
infrastructure can support the

00:14:53.106 --> 00:14:54.326 A:middle
required data rates.

00:14:54.926 --> 00:14:57.276 A:middle
If you have multiple USB
ports in the vehicle,

00:14:57.536 --> 00:14:59.496 A:middle
and not all of them
support CarPlay,

00:14:59.846 --> 00:15:01.566 A:middle
you'll need to properly
label the ports.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:59.846 --> 00:15:01.566 A:middle
you'll need to properly
label the ports.

00:15:05.116 --> 00:15:07.586 A:middle
Wireless CarPlay is
supported in iOS 9.

00:15:09.316 --> 00:15:11.856 A:middle
Both Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi are required.

00:15:13.686 --> 00:15:17.196 A:middle
Bluetooth is used for discovery
and the initial connection.

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:22.886 A:middle
Once the Wi-Fi credentials
are sent to the iPhone

00:15:22.886 --> 00:15:26.356 A:middle
over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi
is connected,

00:15:27.566 --> 00:15:29.156 A:middle
Bluetooth is disconnected,

00:15:29.636 --> 00:15:32.986 A:middle
and all subsequent CarPlay
communication is over Wi-Fi.

00:15:33.686 --> 00:15:36.186 A:middle
During the CarPlay
session, all audio,

00:15:36.466 --> 00:15:40.956 A:middle
including phone call audio and
video, is transmitted over Wi-Fi

00:15:41.376 --> 00:15:42.876 A:middle
as well as the control protocol.

00:15:46.026 --> 00:15:48.836 A:middle
CarPlay requires a
Wi-Fi certified AP,

00:15:48.836 --> 00:15:51.346 A:middle
and 5 gigahertz is recommended.

00:15:51.876 --> 00:15:53.216 A:middle
Note that high throughput,

00:15:53.376 --> 00:15:56.086 A:middle
25 megabits per second,
is required.

00:15:56.896 --> 00:15:58.446 A:middle
The Bluetooth subsystem needs

00:15:58.446 --> 00:16:00.566 A:middle
to support the communication
protocol.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:58.446 --> 00:16:00.566 A:middle
to support the communication
protocol.

00:16:01.596 --> 00:16:05.106 A:middle
Wireless CarPlay offers a
convenient comfortable user

00:16:05.106 --> 00:16:06.686 A:middle
experience, and we're excited

00:16:06.686 --> 00:16:08.546 A:middle
to see your vehicles
that support it.

00:16:10.016 --> 00:16:13.636 A:middle
Now let's hear from Donald about
the CarPlay Design Guidelines.

00:16:14.836 --> 00:16:16.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Donald, and
I work on design at Apple.

00:16:17.796 --> 00:16:19.586 A:middle
Now that you've seen
how CarPlay works,

00:16:20.236 --> 00:16:21.646 A:middle
let's look at some
design guidelines

00:16:21.646 --> 00:16:23.616 A:middle
that will help you provide
the best CarPlay experience

00:16:23.616 --> 00:16:24.276 A:middle
in your cars.

00:16:29.046 --> 00:16:30.206 A:middle
One of the most important
things to keep in mind is

00:16:30.206 --> 00:16:32.716 A:middle
that CarPlay is really designed
to use the entire display.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:38.646 A:middle
CarPlay is instantly
familiar to iPhone users,

00:16:38.646 --> 00:16:39.896 A:middle
and they feel comfortable
with it

00:16:39.896 --> 00:16:42.396 A:middle
because it's a consistent
environment with its own icons,

00:16:43.016 --> 00:16:45.216 A:middle
visual language, and system
of internal navigation.

00:16:46.786 --> 00:16:49.086 A:middle
Every interaction with
CarPlay is easier and faster

00:16:49.086 --> 00:16:50.456 A:middle
when users can trust
that everything

00:16:50.456 --> 00:16:51.876 A:middle
on the screen is
part of CarPlay.

00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:58.856 A:middle
If a user has to discern which
elements are part of CarPlay

00:16:59.826 --> 00:17:02.116 A:middle
and which elements are part
of your car's user interface,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:59.826 --> 00:17:02.116 A:middle
and which elements are part
of your car's user interface,

00:17:03.666 --> 00:17:05.486 A:middle
then every interaction
becomes more challenging.

00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:10.715 A:middle
Also, your car's native user
interface may include icons

00:17:10.715 --> 00:17:12.356 A:middle
that resemble or have
similar functions

00:17:12.356 --> 00:17:13.546 A:middle
to icons within CarPlay.

00:17:14.106 --> 00:17:16.726 A:middle
And it can be confusing
if these icons are

00:17:16.726 --> 00:17:17.976 A:middle
on the display at the same time.

00:17:23.046 --> 00:17:25.116 A:middle
Instead, use the entire
display to show CarPlay.

00:17:30.506 --> 00:17:32.546 A:middle
Let's take a look at what should
happen when CarPlay starts.

00:17:35.366 --> 00:17:37.956 A:middle
CarPlay always starts the moment
iPhone is plugged into your car.

00:17:38.506 --> 00:17:40.346 A:middle
Users should never have to
think about how to start it.

00:17:44.806 --> 00:17:46.486 A:middle
When the user connects
their iPhone to your car

00:17:46.486 --> 00:17:48.636 A:middle
for the first time, the
car's display should switch

00:17:48.636 --> 00:17:49.756 A:middle
to show CarPlay right away.

00:17:53.556 --> 00:17:55.656 A:middle
This provides feedback
that CarPlay is started

00:17:55.656 --> 00:17:58.246 A:middle
and creates a strong association
between the act of connecting

00:17:58.976 --> 00:18:00.666 A:middle
and the familiar
appearance of CarPlay.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:58.976 --> 00:18:00.666 A:middle
and the familiar
appearance of CarPlay.

00:18:04.536 --> 00:18:05.586 A:middle
Don't show notifications

00:18:05.586 --> 00:18:07.466 A:middle
to announce state changes
related to CarPlay.

00:18:07.726 --> 00:18:09.046 A:middle
The needed appearance of CarPlay

00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:11.326 A:middle
in the display is the most
effective visual feedback.

00:18:15.506 --> 00:18:16.686 A:middle
Now let's consider
what should happen

00:18:16.686 --> 00:18:18.146 A:middle
after the initial
CarPlay connection.

00:18:19.166 --> 00:18:21.476 A:middle
When users connect their iPhone
a second time, it should feel

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:23.276 A:middle
like a continuation of
their previous session.

00:18:27.076 --> 00:18:28.626 A:middle
So if CarPlay was
showing on the display

00:18:28.626 --> 00:18:31.016 A:middle
when the user left the car,
CarPlay should be shown again

00:18:31.016 --> 00:18:32.046 A:middle
when iPhone is connected.

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:34.906 A:middle
And if CarPlay media
was being played

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:37.626 A:middle
when the user left the car,
CarPlay media should resume

00:18:37.626 --> 00:18:39.826 A:middle
when iPhone is reconnected
as long

00:18:39.826 --> 00:18:42.826 A:middle
as the user did not select
a different audio source

00:18:42.896 --> 00:18:44.166 A:middle
between their CarPlay
connections.

00:18:46.496 --> 00:18:47.256 A:middle
In other words, we want

00:18:47.256 --> 00:18:49.226 A:middle
to always respect the last
selection the user made

00:18:49.226 --> 00:18:49.676 A:middle
in the car.

00:18:54.186 --> 00:18:55.906 A:middle
Let's see how last
user mode should work.

00:18:56.616 --> 00:18:57.876 A:middle
Notice that I'm using CarPlay,

00:18:57.996 --> 00:18:59.396 A:middle
and it's showing on
the car's display.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:00.766 --> 00:19:04.736 A:middle
Now if I disconnect, CarPlay
ends, and the car falls back

00:19:04.736 --> 00:19:06.006 A:middle
to its native user interface.

00:19:06.566 --> 00:19:10.376 A:middle
If I plug in again, CarPlay
should appear on the display

00:19:10.376 --> 00:19:12.216 A:middle
because that was the last
thing I was doing in the car.

00:19:16.606 --> 00:19:18.766 A:middle
So if CarPlay was the
last thing on the display

00:19:18.766 --> 00:19:21.436 A:middle
when it was disconnected,
or the car was turned off,

00:19:21.546 --> 00:19:23.696 A:middle
CarPlay should be shown when
iPhone is connected again.

00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:27.706 A:middle
If CarPlay media was playing,
CarPlay media should play again.

00:19:32.496 --> 00:19:33.606 A:middle
Let's see a different example.

00:19:33.996 --> 00:19:35.366 A:middle
This time, CarPlay is active

00:19:35.526 --> 00:19:37.826 A:middle
with the car's display showing
the native user interface.

00:19:38.956 --> 00:19:42.076 A:middle
Now if I disconnect
and then plug in again,

00:19:43.106 --> 00:19:44.806 A:middle
CarPlay does not
appear on the display

00:19:45.556 --> 00:19:47.546 A:middle
because the native user
interface was the last thing I

00:19:47.546 --> 00:19:48.496 A:middle
was using in the car.

00:19:52.466 --> 00:19:55.526 A:middle
So if CarPlay was not the last
thing shown, it should remain

00:19:55.526 --> 00:19:56.816 A:middle
in the car's user interface.

00:19:57.766 --> 00:20:00.166 A:middle
But even if CarPlay was not
the last thing on the screen,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:57.766 --> 00:20:00.166 A:middle
But even if CarPlay was not
the last thing on the screen,

00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:02.976 A:middle
if CarPlay media was playing,
CarPlay media should play again.

00:20:07.476 --> 00:20:09.946 A:middle
CarPlay is available the moment
the user plugs in their iPhone,

00:20:10.896 --> 00:20:12.856 A:middle
but they can switch
between the CarPlay display

00:20:12.856 --> 00:20:14.716 A:middle
and the native user
interface at any time.

00:20:15.546 --> 00:20:18.526 A:middle
As we saw earlier,
the user returns

00:20:18.526 --> 00:20:21.226 A:middle
to the car's user interface
by selecting your brand's icon

00:20:21.296 --> 00:20:22.266 A:middle
in the CarPlay Home screen.

00:20:22.916 --> 00:20:25.516 A:middle
They can switch back to CarPlay

00:20:25.516 --> 00:20:26.996 A:middle
by using the Apple
CarPlay button.

00:20:31.236 --> 00:20:33.466 A:middle
The Apple CarPlay button is
the most important indication

00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:34.566 A:middle
that CarPlay is available.

00:20:34.966 --> 00:20:36.276 A:middle
As soon as CarPlay starts,

00:20:36.746 --> 00:20:38.576 A:middle
the Apple CarPlay
button must become active

00:20:38.576 --> 00:20:39.566 A:middle
in your top level menu.

00:20:43.086 --> 00:20:45.966 A:middle
And the Apple CarPlay must only
appear when iPhone is connected

00:20:45.966 --> 00:20:47.036 A:middle
and CarPlay is active.

00:20:51.046 --> 00:20:52.796 A:middle
Be sure to hide the
Apple CarPlay button

00:20:52.796 --> 00:20:53.966 A:middle
when iPhone is disconnected.

00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:00.686 A:middle
And they also show the
Apple CarPlay button


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:00.686 A:middle
And they also show the
Apple CarPlay button

00:21:00.686 --> 00:21:02.716 A:middle
in an enabled state
when CarPlay is active

00:21:03.656 --> 00:21:06.486 A:middle
and in a disabled state
when CarPlay is inactive.

00:21:10.696 --> 00:21:13.546 A:middle
You can optionally replace an
existing button the top level

00:21:13.546 --> 00:21:16.756 A:middle
menu with the Apple CarPlay
button such as a phone button.

00:21:20.866 --> 00:21:22.976 A:middle
Just remember that the Apple
CarPlay button must appear

00:21:22.976 --> 00:21:25.366 A:middle
on your car's Home screen
whenever iPhone is connected.

00:21:25.986 --> 00:21:27.166 A:middle
When iPhone is disconnected,

00:21:27.356 --> 00:21:30.156 A:middle
the Apple CarPlay button must
disappear or be disabled.

00:21:34.046 --> 00:21:35.496 A:middle
Let's talk about the
Apple CarPlay button

00:21:35.496 --> 00:21:37.186 A:middle
that should appear
in your interface.

00:21:37.836 --> 00:21:41.996 A:middle
There are a variety of approved
Apple CarPlay logos available

00:21:42.086 --> 00:21:44.486 A:middle
to use as buttons in your
car's native user interface.

00:21:45.136 --> 00:21:47.256 A:middle
Choose the one that makes the
most sense with your design.

00:21:49.006 --> 00:21:54.106 A:middle
There's a black logo and a
white logo as well as white

00:21:54.106 --> 00:21:55.616 A:middle
and black variance
with backgrounds.

00:21:56.046 --> 00:21:59.566 A:middle
And, finally, there's
a color background.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:06.336 --> 00:22:08.346 A:middle
Let's talk about how
media sources are handled

00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:09.586 A:middle
when iPhone is disconnected.

00:22:12.276 --> 00:22:13.646 A:middle
Let's say that CarPlay
is active,

00:22:13.646 --> 00:22:15.836 A:middle
and the user is listening
to CarPlay audio playback.

00:22:16.326 --> 00:22:20.856 A:middle
When iPhone is disconnected,
it's a strong indication

00:22:20.856 --> 00:22:22.026 A:middle
that they're about
to leave the car.

00:22:22.996 --> 00:22:25.256 A:middle
Your system should
gracefully handle CarPlay media

00:22:25.256 --> 00:22:26.156 A:middle
being disconnected.

00:22:29.226 --> 00:22:31.966 A:middle
When iPhone is disconnected,
the user should hear silence

00:22:31.966 --> 00:22:34.606 A:middle
and audio should not fall
back to another audio source.

00:22:36.156 --> 00:22:39.596 A:middle
If the iPhone is disconnected
while CarPlay is displayed

00:22:39.596 --> 00:22:41.906 A:middle
on the car's display, you
should gracefully fall back

00:22:41.906 --> 00:22:44.326 A:middle
to the last screen displayed
before entering CarPlay.

00:22:45.226 --> 00:22:48.506 A:middle
Don't show a CarPlay unavailable
or device disconnected screen.

00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:55.376 A:middle
So, again, when CarPlay
media is playing,

00:22:55.376 --> 00:22:57.596 A:middle
and the user disconnects iPhone,
they should just hear silence.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:02.336 --> 00:23:04.226 A:middle
The hardware buttons in
your car should also be used

00:23:04.226 --> 00:23:05.106 A:middle
to support CarPlay.

00:23:08.676 --> 00:23:10.546 A:middle
Siri is an integral
part of CarPlay

00:23:10.546 --> 00:23:12.486 A:middle
and requires a dedicated
tactile button.

00:23:13.026 --> 00:23:14.766 A:middle
Because it's so important,
the button should be

00:23:14.766 --> 00:23:16.956 A:middle
on the car steering wheel.

00:23:16.996 --> 00:23:19.426 A:middle
Users expected Siri to
work at any time, whether

00:23:19.426 --> 00:23:21.906 A:middle
or not CarPlay is currently
visible on the car's display.

00:23:23.386 --> 00:23:24.976 A:middle
They also expect the
Siri button to work

00:23:24.976 --> 00:23:26.236 A:middle
like the Home button on iPhone.

00:23:26.836 --> 00:23:29.656 A:middle
Pressing and holding it for 600
milliseconds should activate

00:23:29.656 --> 00:23:32.496 A:middle
Siri, and the activation
delay must not be greater

00:23:32.496 --> 00:23:33.206 A:middle
than one second.

00:23:34.406 --> 00:23:38.056 A:middle
The media buttons in your
car should be connected

00:23:38.056 --> 00:23:40.636 A:middle
to CarPlay media playback
so users can play, pause,

00:23:40.816 --> 00:23:42.576 A:middle
move to the next track
or previous track,

00:23:42.576 --> 00:23:43.876 A:middle
and fast forward and rewind.

00:23:48.206 --> 00:23:50.516 A:middle
Finally, if your car has
shortcut buttons for phone,

00:23:50.516 --> 00:23:53.066 A:middle
media, or navigation,
they should also be mapped

00:23:53.066 --> 00:23:54.576 A:middle
to the respective
apps within CarPlay.

00:23:59.256 --> 00:24:01.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now let's talk about
apps that work in CarPlay.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:59.256 --> 00:24:01.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now let's talk about
apps that work in CarPlay.

00:24:04.546 --> 00:24:06.696 A:middle
Apps supported by
CarPlay will appear

00:24:06.696 --> 00:24:08.706 A:middle
on the CarPlay Home
screen in the vehicle.

00:24:09.306 --> 00:24:11.416 A:middle
Three categories of
apps are supported.

00:24:12.056 --> 00:24:13.956 A:middle
Audio, those specific

00:24:13.956 --> 00:24:17.766 A:middle
to particular vehicles,
and messaging apps.

00:24:18.576 --> 00:24:22.216 A:middle
If a user has an audio app
that's been updated for CarPlay,

00:24:22.636 --> 00:24:23.756 A:middle
that app will appear

00:24:23.756 --> 00:24:26.576 A:middle
in any CarPlay car
the user connects to.

00:24:26.576 --> 00:24:30.386 A:middle
The user interface for
these apps is fixed

00:24:30.656 --> 00:24:32.256 A:middle
with the structure
provided by iOS

00:24:32.576 --> 00:24:35.206 A:middle
and the content provided
by the app itself.

00:24:36.026 --> 00:24:37.996 A:middle
You'll notice that
audio apps look a lot

00:24:37.996 --> 00:24:39.226 A:middle
like the built-in music app.

00:24:40.136 --> 00:24:43.456 A:middle
Users choose what to listen
to via a list-based UI,

00:24:43.706 --> 00:24:47.346 A:middle
and the Now Playing screen
shows the appropriate content

00:24:47.346 --> 00:24:48.126 A:middle
and controls.

00:24:48.986 --> 00:24:51.496 A:middle
The app needs to have a
special entitlement in order

00:24:51.496 --> 00:24:53.036 A:middle
to be compatible with CarPlay.

00:24:54.236 --> 00:24:56.286 A:middle
We've made some improvements
in iOS 10

00:24:56.286 --> 00:25:00.746 A:middle
to make the audio apps
experience even better.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:56.286 --> 00:25:00.746 A:middle
to make the audio apps
experience even better.

00:25:00.846 --> 00:25:04.336 A:middle
New in iOS 10 is support for
tabs, which make it easier

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:06.116 A:middle
to navigate list hierarchies.

00:25:06.896 --> 00:25:10.256 A:middle
In the Now Playing screen,
you can now see the app name

00:25:10.256 --> 00:25:12.226 A:middle
and additional playback
control buttons.

00:25:12.986 --> 00:25:15.616 A:middle
In the list views, you can
tell which item is playing,

00:25:16.296 --> 00:25:18.326 A:middle
which are available
for streaming,

00:25:18.796 --> 00:25:20.586 A:middle
explicit or live stream.

00:25:21.356 --> 00:25:23.586 A:middle
Some apps are designed
to play audio as soon

00:25:23.586 --> 00:25:25.606 A:middle
as they're launched,
and we've added support

00:25:25.606 --> 00:25:27.246 A:middle
for these apps in iOS 10.

00:25:28.096 --> 00:25:31.376 A:middle
All of these combined make for
a much improved experience.

00:25:34.916 --> 00:25:41.406 A:middle
Check out the new tabs, the
Cloud icon for streaming apps,

00:25:43.066 --> 00:25:45.726 A:middle
and the way tend to note
what's currently playing.

00:25:48.226 --> 00:25:51.596 A:middle
In the now playing
screen, here's the app name

00:25:51.596 --> 00:25:55.076 A:middle
and the additional
playback controls.

00:25:56.886 --> 00:25:59.676 A:middle
Now let's talk about that
next category, apps written

00:25:59.676 --> 00:26:01.236 A:middle
to work in specific vehicles.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:59.676 --> 00:26:01.236 A:middle
to work in specific vehicles.

00:26:03.296 --> 00:26:05.406 A:middle
Apps published by
automakers are written

00:26:05.406 --> 00:26:07.006 A:middle
to control vehicle functions

00:26:07.396 --> 00:26:09.476 A:middle
or give information
about the vehicle.

00:26:10.086 --> 00:26:14.146 A:middle
They only appear in vehicles
specific to that automaker.

00:26:14.596 --> 00:26:18.526 A:middle
A CarPlay entitlement is
required for these apps as well.

00:26:19.036 --> 00:26:24.086 A:middle
New in iOS 10 is Siri
support for automaker apps

00:26:24.156 --> 00:26:25.756 A:middle
that control vehicle functions.

00:26:26.586 --> 00:26:30.106 A:middle
Siri now has built-in support
for changing radio stations,

00:26:30.546 --> 00:26:32.896 A:middle
changing climate
controls, and more.

00:26:33.756 --> 00:26:36.346 A:middle
The automaker app
communicates with the vehicle

00:26:36.626 --> 00:26:38.126 A:middle
to perform these functions

00:26:38.126 --> 00:26:43.376 A:middle
after Siri tells the app what
the user would like to do.

00:26:43.746 --> 00:26:46.246 A:middle
Let me explain how
automaker apps work only

00:26:46.246 --> 00:26:47.576 A:middle
in the cars that support them.

00:26:48.226 --> 00:26:51.956 A:middle
An app icon is enabled in
the CarPlay Home screen only

00:26:52.126 --> 00:26:54.266 A:middle
if the iPhone is
connected to a head unit

00:26:54.576 --> 00:26:56.696 A:middle
that supports the same
protocol name as the app.

00:26:57.966 --> 00:26:59.836 A:middle
A protocol name supported
by the head unit

00:26:59.836 --> 00:27:02.086 A:middle
and the app need to match.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.836 --> 00:27:02.086 A:middle
and the app need to match.

00:27:02.976 --> 00:27:06.416 A:middle
iAP external accessory
is used for app

00:27:06.416 --> 00:27:08.226 A:middle
to head unit communication.

00:27:10.026 --> 00:27:12.976 A:middle
Head units can declare
multiple protocol names in order

00:27:12.976 --> 00:27:15.056 A:middle
to support current
and future apps

00:27:15.406 --> 00:27:17.346 A:middle
with different groups
of target cars.

00:27:18.246 --> 00:27:20.506 A:middle
Head units should
use a protocol name

00:27:20.796 --> 00:27:22.916 A:middle
to match all cars
from that brand.

00:27:23.316 --> 00:27:25.416 A:middle
For example, com.brand.

00:27:26.796 --> 00:27:29.726 A:middle
They should also use
protocol names to match cars

00:27:29.726 --> 00:27:31.696 A:middle
with specific features,
for example,

00:27:31.696 --> 00:27:33.636 A:middle
electric vehicles
or sports models.

00:27:35.296 --> 00:27:39.306 A:middle
A protocol name for the specific
model should also be included

00:27:39.556 --> 00:27:41.226 A:middle
so that apps that target just

00:27:41.226 --> 00:27:43.676 A:middle
that model can be
published in the future.

00:27:46.226 --> 00:27:49.236 A:middle
The head unit needs
to use iAP2 to declare

00:27:49.236 --> 00:27:52.896 A:middle
at least one supported
external accessory protocol.

00:27:53.416 --> 00:27:54.656 A:middle
Likely more than one.

00:27:55.546 --> 00:27:59.406 A:middle
Start and stop external protocol
session must also be supported,

00:27:59.966 --> 00:28:04.246 A:middle
and external accessory protocol
CarPlay must be set to true.

00:27:59.966 --> 00:28:04.246 A:middle
and external accessory protocol
CarPlay must be set to true.

00:28:05.296 --> 00:28:08.136 A:middle
If the car supports
wireless and wired CarPlay,

00:28:08.416 --> 00:28:11.666 A:middle
these iAP2 messages
should be implemented

00:28:11.666 --> 00:28:13.696 A:middle
on all supported transports.

00:28:15.296 --> 00:28:17.946 A:middle
Most automaker apps will
communicate with the car

00:28:17.946 --> 00:28:21.336 A:middle
to perform tasks such as
changing the climate controls.

00:28:21.906 --> 00:28:23.446 A:middle
These apps need to design

00:28:23.446 --> 00:28:26.046 A:middle
and implement a communication
protocol as well.

00:28:28.486 --> 00:28:30.686 A:middle
So how does the app
support this feature?

00:28:31.216 --> 00:28:34.726 A:middle
The app's Entitlements.plist
needs to be modified

00:28:34.726 --> 00:28:37.706 A:middle
to include the protocol
names that match those

00:28:37.706 --> 00:28:40.206 A:middle
on the target head
units, as shown here.

00:28:41.176 --> 00:28:44.686 A:middle
With these additions plus
support for the protocol

00:28:44.686 --> 00:28:48.326 A:middle
to communicate with the car,
and a CarPlay entitlement,

00:28:48.926 --> 00:28:50.696 A:middle
your app will be
ready for CarPlay.

00:28:51.416 --> 00:28:54.096 A:middle
We're looking forward to
seeing some great CarPlay apps

00:28:54.096 --> 00:28:54.956 A:middle
from automakers.

00:28:57.506 --> 00:29:00.166 A:middle
We have a new category of
apps supported in CarPlay

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:57.506 --> 00:29:00.166 A:middle
We have a new category of
apps supported in CarPlay

00:29:00.166 --> 00:29:02.326 A:middle
and iOS10, messaging apps.

00:29:03.236 --> 00:29:06.036 A:middle
When a messaging app has been
updated to support CarPlay,

00:29:06.406 --> 00:29:08.776 A:middle
that app will appear on
the CarPlay Home screen.

00:29:09.606 --> 00:29:11.546 A:middle
Messages can be received
and sent,

00:29:11.946 --> 00:29:14.056 A:middle
all driven by Siri interactions.

00:29:14.936 --> 00:29:18.656 A:middle
We're excited to extend CarPlay
capability to messaging apps,

00:29:18.656 --> 00:29:21.276 A:middle
making that experience
smarter and safer.

00:29:23.716 --> 00:29:26.436 A:middle
We hope this has been a
useful overview of CarPlay.

00:29:26.856 --> 00:29:29.296 A:middle
CarPlay is a great way to
keep the user experience

00:29:29.296 --> 00:29:32.876 A:middle
in vehicles fresh long into
the future, and we're delighted

00:29:32.876 --> 00:29:35.396 A:middle
to get a chance to talk
to you about the features

00:29:35.396 --> 00:29:37.076 A:middle
that are new in iOS 10.

00:29:39.496 --> 00:29:44.686 A:middle

00:29:46.486 --> 00:29:49.866 A:middle
We also have a follow-on
CarPlay deep dive video session

00:29:49.866 --> 00:29:50.776 A:middle
that may interest you.

00:29:52.126 --> 00:29:53.066 A:middle
Thank you for watching.
