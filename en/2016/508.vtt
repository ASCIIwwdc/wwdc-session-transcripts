00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:29.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. Welcome to the
Apple News Format Session.

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:32.665 A:middle
My name's Casey and today my
colleague Dan and I are going

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:35.316 A:middle
to show you how you can
create some beautiful

00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:38.836 A:middle
and engaging articles for news
using the Apple News Format.

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:40.966 A:middle
By the end of today's session,

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.936 A:middle
you will have a detailed
understanding

00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:46.146 A:middle
of all the design capabilities
of the Apple News Format,

00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:49.746 A:middle
as well as an understanding
of all the code used

00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:50.816 A:middle
to construct those stories.

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.456 A:middle
Believe it or not,
we're even going

00:00:53.456 --> 00:00:55.196 A:middle
to identify some efficiencies

00:00:55.236 --> 00:00:56.786 A:middle
between your design
and your markup.

00:00:57.726 --> 00:01:01.326 A:middle
Dan's going to cover a variety
of features that will allow you

00:00:57.726 --> 00:01:01.326 A:middle
Dan's going to cover a variety
of features that will allow you

00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:04.256 A:middle
to create some beautiful
layouts that are reminiscent

00:01:04.256 --> 00:01:08.016 A:middle
of magazine-type style,
including features

00:01:08.016 --> 00:01:12.256 A:middle
like drop caps, side bars,
galleries, and animations.

00:01:12.786 --> 00:01:16.056 A:middle
With the Apple News Format,
your articles are going

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:19.916 A:middle
to look amazing on the iPad

00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:23.906 A:middle
and they will effortlessly
adapt to every screen size.

00:01:24.086 --> 00:01:28.636 A:middle
That's because the Apple News
Format is inherently responsive.

00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:32.406 A:middle
It ensures that your stories are
always going to look their best.

00:01:33.406 --> 00:01:36.266 A:middle
So, obviously there's a
lot of features to dive

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:39.326 A:middle
into here today, but first
it's really important

00:01:39.326 --> 00:01:40.856 A:middle
that I give you a bit of context

00:01:40.856 --> 00:01:42.516 A:middle
around the News Application
itself.

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:46.066 A:middle
And that's because
news is the foundation

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:48.606 A:middle
for how users are
going to discover

00:01:48.606 --> 00:01:49.906 A:middle
and experience your stories.

00:01:50.306 --> 00:01:55.026 A:middle
News is a news aggregator
application,

00:01:55.026 --> 00:01:59.566 A:middle
it comes preinstalled on the iOS
in the US, UK, and Australia.

00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:01.326 A:middle
Okay. That's really
stuffy though, right?

00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:01.326 A:middle
Okay. That's really
stuffy though, right?

00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:02.346 A:middle
News aggregator.

00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:06.886 A:middle
I prefer to think of news as
a kind of matchmaker service.

00:02:07.776 --> 00:02:11.836 A:middle
News helps readers find stories
that they're going to love.

00:02:12.076 --> 00:02:15.286 A:middle
And that's really great news for
publishers, because that means

00:02:15.286 --> 00:02:18.006 A:middle
that they get to find new fans.

00:02:18.206 --> 00:02:22.756 A:middle
News makes its recommendations
based on channels and topics

00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:24.376 A:middle
that a reader chooses to follow.

00:02:24.576 --> 00:02:26.796 A:middle
And then it places
relevant stories

00:02:27.116 --> 00:02:29.126 A:middle
into the readers For You feed.

00:02:30.226 --> 00:02:34.426 A:middle
And that For You feed is
the key to content discovery

00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:36.386 A:middle
for users, and publishers alike.

00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:40.316 A:middle
As a reader, I can find anything
that interests me there,

00:02:40.316 --> 00:02:43.116 A:middle
from CNN to craft beer.

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:46.286 A:middle
Oh, this is Eddy's For You Feed,

00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:51.276 A:middle
so Formula 1 racing
and super cars.

00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:54.426 A:middle
At any case, the point
is, is that there's

00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:56.836 A:middle
such a breadth of
content in news.

00:02:56.836 --> 00:02:59.096 A:middle
And that breadth, it
speaks to the fact

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:01.196 A:middle
that anybody can
publish to the News app.

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:01.196 A:middle
that anybody can
publish to the News app.

00:03:01.996 --> 00:03:06.266 A:middle
You can publish today and
begin to connect with readers

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:07.336 A:middle
and begin earning revenue.

00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:09.976 A:middle
And you can do that using
several different methods.

00:03:09.976 --> 00:03:15.286 A:middle
Including RSS, the News
Publisher Authoring Tool,

00:03:15.826 --> 00:03:16.916 A:middle
and the Apple News Format.

00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:19.886 A:middle
If you haven't checked it
out already, you should check

00:03:19.886 --> 00:03:23.056 A:middle
out the Getting Started
in Apple News Session,

00:03:23.056 --> 00:03:24.256 A:middle
it was earlier this week.

00:03:24.256 --> 00:03:25.686 A:middle
It's available on video now.

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:29.086 A:middle
That session reviews all
three of these methods.

00:03:29.226 --> 00:03:32.466 A:middle
This section focuses just
on the Apple News Format.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.756 A:middle
And that's because the Apple
News Format is superhelpful

00:03:36.046 --> 00:03:38.246 A:middle
for any number of things
you're going to want to do,

00:03:38.246 --> 00:03:40.746 A:middle
including HAN authoring
articles,

00:03:41.316 --> 00:03:45.156 A:middle
maybe creating a translation
layer on top of your CMS

00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:48.376 A:middle
so that you can programmatically
deliver content, and articles,

00:03:48.376 --> 00:03:51.586 A:middle
and stories from your CMS to
the Apple News Application.

00:03:52.196 --> 00:03:55.406 A:middle
Or, even for contributing to
some of the plugins out there

00:03:55.406 --> 00:03:58.096 A:middle
for platforms, like
WordPress or Drupal.

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:02.006 A:middle
Knowing the Apple News Format is
going to prove really helpful.

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:02.006 A:middle
Knowing the Apple News Format is
going to prove really helpful.

00:04:02.416 --> 00:04:04.636 A:middle
And, it's just JSON.

00:04:05.876 --> 00:04:10.926 A:middle
The Apple News Format uses
JSON to create powerful designs

00:04:10.926 --> 00:04:13.366 A:middle
that are both performant
and responsive.

00:04:14.016 --> 00:04:18.326 A:middle
JSON is also really great for
converting between formats,

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:23.426 A:middle
and it allows us to have
an extensible format.

00:04:23.426 --> 00:04:26.086 A:middle
And that extensible nature

00:04:26.186 --> 00:04:29.426 A:middle
of the Apple News
Format is superimportant

00:04:29.616 --> 00:04:33.216 A:middle
because it allows us to
develop features at a quick pace

00:04:33.646 --> 00:04:35.456 A:middle
without any additional
dependencies.

00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:39.216 A:middle
So I feel like we've given you
a pretty good background here

00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:40.166 A:middle
around News.

00:04:40.586 --> 00:04:43.786 A:middle
So now we can really jump
into the nuts and bolts

00:04:43.856 --> 00:04:45.056 A:middle
of the Apple News Format.

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:46.566 A:middle
Here's Dan to take it away.

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:48.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Casey.

00:04:49.866 --> 00:04:51.996 A:middle
So now that you have
a sense of the world

00:04:51.996 --> 00:04:54.676 A:middle
in which these articles
live, let's dig into the nuts

00:04:54.676 --> 00:04:56.356 A:middle
and bolts of how you
actually make an article

00:04:56.676 --> 00:04:57.476 A:middle
with Apple News Format.

00:04:57.476 --> 00:04:59.006 A:middle
So what we're going to
do today is we're going

00:04:59.006 --> 00:05:01.916 A:middle
to take this sample
article and we're going

00:04:59.006 --> 00:05:01.916 A:middle
to take this sample
article and we're going

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:02.866 A:middle
to tear it down to the skeleton.

00:05:02.866 --> 00:05:04.986 A:middle
And then we're going
to build it back

00:05:04.986 --> 00:05:06.406 A:middle
up so we understand
the fundamentals.

00:05:06.766 --> 00:05:08.986 A:middle
We're going to make
it responsive.

00:05:09.056 --> 00:05:11.736 A:middle
And then finally we're going
to add some animations.

00:05:12.956 --> 00:05:15.156 A:middle
So here's our article skeleton.

00:05:15.996 --> 00:05:17.386 A:middle
Let's dig into some of
the properties here.

00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:19.496 A:middle
Our first property is title.

00:05:20.266 --> 00:05:22.116 A:middle
And this is a title as
it will appear to users

00:05:22.116 --> 00:05:23.096 A:middle
who are browsing the feed.

00:05:23.646 --> 00:05:27.396 A:middle
Next, we have excerpt, our
first piece of metadata.

00:05:28.016 --> 00:05:29.586 A:middle
And this is the snippet
of text that appears

00:05:29.646 --> 00:05:31.706 A:middle
with the title also in the feed.

00:05:32.446 --> 00:05:34.836 A:middle
And finally, you get to
define the thumbnail image,

00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:36.206 A:middle
using a thumbnail URL.

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:38.556 A:middle
Now let's step back
for a second and talk

00:05:38.556 --> 00:05:40.296 A:middle
about a few thumbnail
image tips.

00:05:40.806 --> 00:05:43.726 A:middle
So first of all,
the accepted formats

00:05:43.916 --> 00:05:47.246 A:middle
for thumbnails are JPEG and PNG.

00:05:47.516 --> 00:05:49.656 A:middle
Second, definitely send
us high resolution art.

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.866 A:middle
We'll take care of
down-sampling on our backend.

00:05:54.176 --> 00:05:57.086 A:middle
The pizel size is
300 by 300 pixels.

00:05:57.086 --> 00:05:59.836 A:middle
If you go smaller than that your
image isn't going to show up.

00:05:59.836 --> 00:06:01.186 A:middle
So definitely sent us your best.

00:05:59.836 --> 00:06:01.186 A:middle
So definitely sent us your best.

00:06:01.316 --> 00:06:04.776 A:middle
And we do have a few
moderate requirements in terms

00:06:04.776 --> 00:06:05.936 A:middle
of width height ratios.

00:06:06.476 --> 00:06:08.986 A:middle
So for thumbnail
images, you need to be

00:06:08.986 --> 00:06:10.986 A:middle
at least as wide as 1 to 2.

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:15.676 A:middle
But no wider than 3 to 1.

00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:16.356 A:middle
Moving on.

00:06:16.356 --> 00:06:18.366 A:middle
Our last piece on metadata
that we're going to talk

00:06:18.366 --> 00:06:19.886 A:middle
about today is cannonicalURL.

00:06:19.886 --> 00:06:22.956 A:middle
And this is simply a web
version of your article.

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:26.076 A:middle
And if you have one, definitely
include this metadata.

00:06:26.566 --> 00:06:29.096 A:middle
It's going to be really
important if a user say,

00:06:29.536 --> 00:06:30.906 A:middle
shares your article to a friend

00:06:30.906 --> 00:06:32.246 A:middle
who doesn't have
access to Apple News.

00:06:32.806 --> 00:06:34.286 A:middle
Having that one version
to fall back

00:06:34.286 --> 00:06:36.056 A:middle
on will make a much
better experience.

00:06:36.406 --> 00:06:39.546 A:middle
So we talked about metadata.

00:06:40.196 --> 00:06:41.466 A:middle
Let's dive into the content.

00:06:42.296 --> 00:06:44.596 A:middle
So, content lives
in a top-level array

00:06:44.596 --> 00:06:46.486 A:middle
in your article,
called components.

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:50.576 A:middle
And, each of your pieces
of content is represented

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:53.336 A:middle
by a JSON object which
is the component.

00:06:53.576 --> 00:06:57.246 A:middle
Each one has a semantic
rule, like heading1, title,

00:06:57.356 --> 00:06:59.436 A:middle
intro, byline, and body.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.646 A:middle
Choosing the most
appropriate role

00:07:02.646 --> 00:07:04.736 A:middle
for your content is
critical for accessibility.

00:07:04.736 --> 00:07:08.896 A:middle
So we touched on semantics,

00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:10.876 A:middle
but what if you want
to style your text?

00:07:11.376 --> 00:07:13.306 A:middle
So this is where
component textiles come in.

00:07:14.396 --> 00:07:16.756 A:middle
And component textiles is
a top-level dictionary.

00:07:16.756 --> 00:07:19.186 A:middle
And we're going to
make our styles

00:07:19.186 --> 00:07:20.116 A:middle
in three different layers.

00:07:20.116 --> 00:07:22.636 A:middle
So the first one we're
going to do is we're going

00:07:22.636 --> 00:07:25.166 A:middle
to make a default style, that's
going to lay the baseline styles

00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:26.386 A:middle
for all of our text components.

00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:30.696 A:middle
Then, we're going to define a
number of rule-specific styles

00:07:30.996 --> 00:07:33.006 A:middle
that are going to
build on default.

00:07:33.776 --> 00:07:36.396 A:middle
And finally we're going to
make it a non-default style.

00:07:36.486 --> 00:07:38.766 A:middle
And this is for when you need
an exception for the rule.

00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:43.116 A:middle
Okay, so here's our
default style.

00:07:43.726 --> 00:07:45.186 A:middle
And let's take a look at
the properties inside.

00:07:45.696 --> 00:07:46.566 A:middle
First we have font name.

00:07:47.566 --> 00:07:50.006 A:middle
And one thing to keep in mind
is that font name is not,

00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:52.816 A:middle
declare your font is not
quite the same as in say CSS.

00:07:53.586 --> 00:07:54.776 A:middle
So keep two things in mind.

00:07:55.586 --> 00:07:58.846 A:middle
First of all, when referencing
fonts, you need to call them

00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:01.956 A:middle
by their postscript name,
not by their family name.

00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:01.956 A:middle
by their postscript name,
not by their family name.

00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:06.046 A:middle
And two, the fonts that you use
need to be available on iOS.

00:08:06.776 --> 00:08:09.766 A:middle
So, if you wanted to channel
those sweet nineties design

00:08:09.766 --> 00:08:12.826 A:middle
skills, you could make the real
use of the Chalkboard family,

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.156 A:middle
using these postscript names.

00:08:14.676 --> 00:08:17.936 A:middle
Next we have text color.

00:08:18.406 --> 00:08:19.906 A:middle
Text color takes a hex value.

00:08:19.906 --> 00:08:22.206 A:middle
You can use the shorter
form if you want.

00:08:22.926 --> 00:08:25.276 A:middle
Or if you need alpha, you can
use the 8-character version.

00:08:26.976 --> 00:08:28.146 A:middle
Then we have font size.

00:08:28.356 --> 00:08:30.016 A:middle
And font size is
declared in points.

00:08:30.666 --> 00:08:32.056 A:middle
But we shorthand
that to an integer.

00:08:32.056 --> 00:08:34.426 A:middle
Now, just because
it's in points,

00:08:34.426 --> 00:08:35.926 A:middle
don't think of this
as an absolute value.

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:40.356 A:middle
The app's going to take your
font size and when users look

00:08:40.356 --> 00:08:43.775 A:middle
at it on different devices, it's
going to make some adjustments

00:08:43.966 --> 00:08:44.976 A:middle
to optimize legibility.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:49.076 A:middle
And that said, a good
rule of thumb is try not

00:08:49.076 --> 00:08:51.076 A:middle
to go below 16 points
for your body copy.

00:08:51.836 --> 00:08:56.056 A:middle
On a similar note, line height's
also declared in points.

00:08:56.776 --> 00:08:58.546 A:middle
And you want to define
your line height relative

00:08:58.546 --> 00:09:00.676 A:middle
to the font size you've
chosen, we'll maintain

00:08:58.546 --> 00:09:00.676 A:middle
to the font size you've
chosen, we'll maintain

00:09:00.676 --> 00:09:02.056 A:middle
that ratio across devices.

00:09:02.636 --> 00:09:05.446 A:middle
And finally we have
length style.

00:09:05.686 --> 00:09:07.836 A:middle
So this is where you get
to define some overrides

00:09:08.436 --> 00:09:12.316 A:middle
for any links that appear in
the text in your component.

00:09:12.316 --> 00:09:13.646 A:middle
Here [inaudible]
find a text color,

00:09:13.856 --> 00:09:15.426 A:middle
but there's certainly
nothing stopping me

00:09:15.426 --> 00:09:16.236 A:middle
from adding an underline.

00:09:16.236 --> 00:09:22.306 A:middle
So now that we have
our default style,

00:09:22.476 --> 00:09:24.966 A:middle
let's add our first
role specific default.

00:09:25.366 --> 00:09:28.816 A:middle
So this one has a special
name, just like default.

00:09:28.816 --> 00:09:29.696 A:middle
It's called default body.

00:09:29.696 --> 00:09:32.286 A:middle
And this is going to lay
down the baseline styles

00:09:32.286 --> 00:09:35.946 A:middle
for any body component, with
two new properties here.

00:09:35.946 --> 00:09:39.396 A:middle
We have ParagraphSpacingBefore
and ParagraphSpacingAfter.

00:09:39.886 --> 00:09:42.596 A:middle
And as you would hope, they
affect paragraph spacing.

00:09:42.596 --> 00:09:44.536 A:middle
But what does it mean
to have paragraphs

00:09:44.536 --> 00:09:45.756 A:middle
in a component based system.

00:09:47.356 --> 00:09:49.236 A:middle
So let's take a look at
our first body component.

00:09:49.866 --> 00:09:52.176 A:middle
And this one component actually
has two paragraphs inside of it.

00:09:53.406 --> 00:09:54.186 A:middle
That's our first one.

00:09:54.526 --> 00:09:56.396 A:middle
And that's our second one.

00:09:57.226 --> 00:10:00.206 A:middle
And we divide them with two
new lines, markdown style.

00:09:57.226 --> 00:10:00.206 A:middle
And we divide them with two
new lines, markdown style.

00:10:01.176 --> 00:10:04.476 A:middle
And speaking of which,
you may have noticed this

00:10:04.546 --> 00:10:05.516 A:middle
format declaration.

00:10:06.086 --> 00:10:08.526 A:middle
In Apple News Format, you get
to choose between plain text

00:10:08.576 --> 00:10:10.416 A:middle
and markdown for
your text formatting.

00:10:11.456 --> 00:10:13.936 A:middle
And in this case, we're taking
advantage of that right now

00:10:14.386 --> 00:10:19.336 A:middle
with this markdown
style, links and text.

00:10:19.496 --> 00:10:21.326 A:middle
Whether you choose plain
text or markdown though,

00:10:21.446 --> 00:10:23.466 A:middle
you can use these
paragraph spacing properties

00:10:23.866 --> 00:10:26.396 A:middle
to effect the spacing
between the paragraphs inside

00:10:26.396 --> 00:10:26.896 A:middle
your component.

00:10:27.446 --> 00:10:33.296 A:middle
So now that we've seen how to
make a role specific default,

00:10:33.336 --> 00:10:36.906 A:middle
let's just quickly hammer
out the rest of them.

00:10:37.046 --> 00:10:39.556 A:middle
So for our heading up top,
I've added some tracking,

00:10:39.896 --> 00:10:41.516 A:middle
so to give some breathing
room to letters.

00:10:42.116 --> 00:10:45.356 A:middle
Kicked up the size of the
title, added some color,

00:10:46.776 --> 00:10:48.386 A:middle
lightened up the intro.

00:10:49.496 --> 00:10:51.396 A:middle
So, subtle changes
for our byline,

00:10:51.686 --> 00:10:54.006 A:middle
as well as for our
subheading, further down.

00:10:54.006 --> 00:10:57.026 A:middle
So now that we got
that out of the way,

00:10:57.666 --> 00:10:59.036 A:middle
let's move onto something
more interesting.

00:10:59.036 --> 00:11:00.576 A:middle
Let's make our first
non-default style.

00:10:59.036 --> 00:11:00.576 A:middle
Let's make our first
non-default style.

00:11:01.096 --> 00:11:02.976 A:middle
And we're going to take this
opportunity to add a drop cap.

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:14.166 A:middle
So, one thing to keep in mind
is because we're doing this

00:11:14.166 --> 00:11:16.966 A:middle
in three tiers, we've already
covered most of the styles

00:11:16.966 --> 00:11:18.296 A:middle
that we want for
our body components

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.126 A:middle
in default and default body.

00:11:20.426 --> 00:11:23.196 A:middle
So with this third layer,
with this custom style,

00:11:23.836 --> 00:11:26.316 A:middle
all we're going to do is define
how the drop cap should look.

00:11:26.986 --> 00:11:29.636 A:middle
And we're going to do that in
a special drop cap property.

00:11:30.736 --> 00:11:33.066 A:middle
And inside of that you get to
define some style overrides

00:11:33.066 --> 00:11:34.056 A:middle
for the first character

00:11:34.476 --> 00:11:35.916 A:middle
in the first paragraph
of that component.

00:11:37.116 --> 00:11:38.346 A:middle
And the interesting thing here,

00:11:38.686 --> 00:11:40.086 A:middle
is this number of
lines property.

00:11:40.636 --> 00:11:42.986 A:middle
This is where you get
to define how many lines

00:11:42.986 --> 00:11:44.526 A:middle
of text your drop
cap should span.

00:11:45.726 --> 00:11:46.906 A:middle
And as you can see
here, I'm just going

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:50.626 A:middle
with a very simple
two-line drop cap.

00:11:50.866 --> 00:11:51.796 A:middle
So we made our style,

00:11:51.796 --> 00:11:54.066 A:middle
but because there's no
semantic relationships

00:11:54.066 --> 00:11:57.026 A:middle
between this component textile
and any particular component,

00:11:57.456 --> 00:11:58.216 A:middle
we need to call it out.

00:11:59.356 --> 00:12:01.906 A:middle
We do that by adding a textile
property to our component.

00:11:59.356 --> 00:12:01.906 A:middle
We do that by adding a textile
property to our component.

00:12:02.466 --> 00:12:04.776 A:middle
And naming the name of
the style that is made.

00:12:04.776 --> 00:12:08.046 A:middle
In this case it's called
body first drop cap.

00:12:08.266 --> 00:12:09.166 A:middle
And once you do that,

00:12:09.376 --> 00:12:12.466 A:middle
on the right you can see we
get our two-line drop cap.

00:12:14.086 --> 00:12:16.666 A:middle
So, stepping back, compared
to our raw text dump

00:12:16.666 --> 00:12:19.146 A:middle
at the beginning, now that
we have some textiles,

00:12:19.146 --> 00:12:20.056 A:middle
things are looking a lot better.

00:12:20.666 --> 00:12:21.366 A:middle
But it's a bit jumbled.

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.176 A:middle
We definitely need
some margins here.

00:12:23.496 --> 00:12:25.586 A:middle
And this is where
component layouts come in.

00:12:26.786 --> 00:12:29.396 A:middle
So, component layout is our
next top-level dictionary

00:12:29.396 --> 00:12:29.826 A:middle
we're adding.

00:12:30.706 --> 00:12:32.156 A:middle
And inside we can
set define layouts,

00:12:32.156 --> 00:12:34.146 A:middle
which gives us the
ability to add top

00:12:34.146 --> 00:12:36.096 A:middle
and bottom margins
to our components.

00:12:36.616 --> 00:12:38.416 A:middle
We also do a few more things,
which we'll touch on layer.

00:12:39.946 --> 00:12:42.206 A:middle
And we have flag component
layouts to a component

00:12:42.646 --> 00:12:43.966 A:middle
by adding a layout property.

00:12:44.516 --> 00:12:49.336 A:middle
Once we do that, we've got some
breathing room in our article,

00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:51.836 A:middle
and topography, things
are looking a lot better.

00:12:52.036 --> 00:12:55.796 A:middle
But, let's take advantage of
another simple and cool way

00:12:55.866 --> 00:12:58.316 A:middle
to add more control over
our vertical spacing.

00:12:58.756 --> 00:12:59.526 A:middle
Let's add a divider.

00:13:00.336 --> 00:13:02.346 A:middle
And let's put it between
our heading, up top,

00:13:02.346 --> 00:13:06.026 A:middle
and the title of the article.

00:13:06.026 --> 00:13:06.746 A:middle
So, there's our divider.

00:13:07.216 --> 00:13:09.816 A:middle
And you can see we have some
control over the stroke.

00:13:09.816 --> 00:13:11.426 A:middle
We can change the
width and the color.

00:13:12.256 --> 00:13:14.276 A:middle
But, personally what I
think is really cool,

00:13:14.886 --> 00:13:16.356 A:middle
here is what's happening
in the layout.

00:13:17.236 --> 00:13:18.386 A:middle
So take a look at the divider

00:13:18.386 --> 00:13:20.416 A:middle
and see how it extends
all the way

00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:21.466 A:middle
to the right side of the screen.

00:13:21.466 --> 00:13:24.076 A:middle
This is nothing that's
inherent to divider.

00:13:24.606 --> 00:13:27.086 A:middle
It's something that we're doing
inside the component layout.

00:13:27.466 --> 00:13:30.416 A:middle
We're using a special property
called ignoreDocumentMargin.

00:13:31.226 --> 00:13:33.346 A:middle
And you can see I've
given it a value of right,

00:13:33.926 --> 00:13:37.416 A:middle
which means just
ignore the margin

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:42.836 A:middle
and go all the way to the edge.

00:13:42.996 --> 00:13:45.596 A:middle
So now we've got
component textiles,

00:13:45.596 --> 00:13:47.246 A:middle
we've got component
layouts, we have a divider.

00:13:47.756 --> 00:13:49.556 A:middle
Things are looking
pretty good from,

00:13:49.666 --> 00:13:51.116 A:middle
you know, a text perspective.

00:13:52.066 --> 00:13:53.366 A:middle
Now it's time to
add some fun stuff.

00:13:54.456 --> 00:13:58.856 A:middle
And, the best way to start
that is with a photo.

00:13:59.026 --> 00:14:00.086 A:middle
So, got my photo component.

00:13:59.026 --> 00:14:00.086 A:middle
So, got my photo component.

00:14:00.866 --> 00:14:02.506 A:middle
Below that I added
a caption component.

00:14:02.906 --> 00:14:06.196 A:middle
But, inside the footer
component,

00:14:06.196 --> 00:14:09.416 A:middle
you might see this caption
property, which appears

00:14:09.416 --> 00:14:11.246 A:middle
to be sort of replicating
the caption component.

00:14:11.776 --> 00:14:14.726 A:middle
And what's really happening
here is we're defining a caption

00:14:14.726 --> 00:14:16.996 A:middle
as it will appear if
the user taps the photo,

00:14:16.996 --> 00:14:19.786 A:middle
goes into full screen view,
as you can see on the right.

00:14:21.366 --> 00:14:23.526 A:middle
This is also a critical
thing to include for reasons

00:14:23.526 --> 00:14:27.106 A:middle
of accessibility, as the caption
here is what will be read

00:14:27.106 --> 00:14:28.086 A:middle
to VoiceOver users.

00:14:31.116 --> 00:14:33.406 A:middle
Next, returning to our layout,

00:14:34.396 --> 00:14:36.146 A:middle
you can see that this
photo is full bleed,

00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:37.986 A:middle
it's going all the way from
the left side of the screen

00:14:37.986 --> 00:14:38.886 A:middle
to the right side of the screen.

00:14:39.046 --> 00:14:41.016 A:middle
And again, this is not
something that's inherent

00:14:41.016 --> 00:14:43.426 A:middle
to the photo component,
we're making use

00:14:43.426 --> 00:14:45.466 A:middle
of the ignoreDocumentMargin
property again.

00:14:46.326 --> 00:14:48.636 A:middle
This time though, instead
of a value of right,

00:14:48.636 --> 00:14:49.626 A:middle
I've given a value of true,

00:14:49.816 --> 00:14:51.766 A:middle
which just means
ignore both margins.

00:14:52.306 --> 00:14:56.246 A:middle
And then finally,
we have our URL,

00:14:56.416 --> 00:14:57.746 A:middle
which points to the image asset.

00:14:58.436 --> 00:15:00.906 A:middle
And I'll step back and talk
about some requirements

00:14:58.436 --> 00:15:00.906 A:middle
And I'll step back and talk
about some requirements

00:15:00.906 --> 00:15:02.926 A:middle
for images that appear
inside the article view.

00:15:02.926 --> 00:15:07.456 A:middle
So images can be referenced
both locally or remote,

00:15:07.696 --> 00:15:10.746 A:middle
just use the correct scheme.

00:15:10.956 --> 00:15:12.506 A:middle
Again, just like
with thumbnail URL,

00:15:12.666 --> 00:15:14.256 A:middle
definitely send us
high resolution art.

00:15:14.766 --> 00:15:16.976 A:middle
We'll take care of down
sampling on a per device basis.

00:15:17.546 --> 00:15:22.396 A:middle
For images inside the article
view, you can use JPEG, PNG,

00:15:22.396 --> 00:15:25.976 A:middle
as well as GIF, and we
definitely support anime GIFs.

00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:30.456 A:middle
So, that's photo.

00:15:30.456 --> 00:15:31.776 A:middle
But what if you have
a number of photos

00:15:31.776 --> 00:15:33.376 A:middle
that all go together
thematically?

00:15:34.056 --> 00:15:36.746 A:middle
This is where the gallery
component comes in.

00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:38.886 A:middle
And implementation
is a piece of cake.

00:15:39.276 --> 00:15:41.106 A:middle
You simply specify
a role of gallery.

00:15:41.996 --> 00:15:43.276 A:middle
You feed it an array of images.

00:15:44.046 --> 00:15:45.816 A:middle
And what you get is a
great user experience

00:15:46.026 --> 00:15:47.166 A:middle
where the user can engage

00:15:47.166 --> 00:15:49.556 A:middle
with the slide show
in the article view.

00:15:49.906 --> 00:15:51.846 A:middle
They can tap, go to
full screen view,

00:15:52.256 --> 00:15:53.616 A:middle
see the image specific captions.

00:15:54.506 --> 00:15:56.566 A:middle
And when they're done, the
swipe out and continue reading.

00:15:57.176 --> 00:16:02.796 A:middle
Now, building on that we have an
alternative to standard gallery,

00:15:57.176 --> 00:16:02.796 A:middle
Now, building on that we have an
alternative to standard gallery,

00:16:03.146 --> 00:16:04.296 A:middle
called the mosaic gallery.

00:16:05.156 --> 00:16:06.886 A:middle
And this has the
same implementation,

00:16:07.326 --> 00:16:09.426 A:middle
except you switch the roll
from gallery to mosaic,

00:16:09.966 --> 00:16:12.436 A:middle
and what you get is this
really cool composite image

00:16:13.086 --> 00:16:14.846 A:middle
of your images that you
can see on the right.

00:16:15.346 --> 00:16:18.156 A:middle
And best of all, users
retain the ability to tap

00:16:18.326 --> 00:16:21.396 A:middle
into the gallery and get this
same full screen experience.

00:16:22.116 --> 00:16:25.676 A:middle
Next, we have social
media embeds.

00:16:26.246 --> 00:16:27.806 A:middle
Apple New Format has
support for a number

00:16:27.806 --> 00:16:29.886 A:middle
of these including
Facebook, Vine,

00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:31.466 A:middle
and as you can see here Twitter.

00:16:32.256 --> 00:16:35.046 A:middle
And implementation is really
as simple as knowing the URL

00:16:35.046 --> 00:16:36.846 A:middle
of the thing that
you want to embed.

00:16:37.406 --> 00:16:43.236 A:middle
Next, getting into
more involved embeds,

00:16:43.276 --> 00:16:44.606 A:middle
we have support for Apple Maps.

00:16:45.286 --> 00:16:48.756 A:middle
And here's a really good example
from Travel making cool use

00:16:48.756 --> 00:16:49.806 A:middle
of the Apple Maps feature.

00:16:50.796 --> 00:16:52.896 A:middle
Including one of these
is a great when you want

00:16:52.896 --> 00:16:56.006 A:middle
to show your user a location
but give them the opportunity

00:16:56.006 --> 00:16:57.926 A:middle
to get some context
on their own terms.

00:16:58.106 --> 00:17:00.446 A:middle
So if you're adding all
of these great features

00:16:58.106 --> 00:17:00.446 A:middle
So if you're adding all
of these great features

00:17:00.446 --> 00:17:02.906 A:middle
and interesting content, you
might be looking for a way

00:17:02.906 --> 00:17:05.366 A:middle
to monetize your efforts and
that's where ads come in.

00:17:05.606 --> 00:17:08.276 A:middle
So let's just touch real
quickly on the two ways

00:17:08.276 --> 00:17:10.665 A:middle
that you can add ads into your
Apple News Format Article.

00:17:11.786 --> 00:17:15.016 A:middle
So first if you need control,
ad components are the way to go.

00:17:15.106 --> 00:17:19.116 A:middle
So you literally place these in
your content, at opportunities

00:17:19.116 --> 00:17:20.336 A:middle
where you think it
would be appropriate

00:17:20.336 --> 00:17:21.126 A:middle
to have an ad appear.

00:17:21.736 --> 00:17:24.175 A:middle
If you don't need that
much control, though,

00:17:24.976 --> 00:17:27.806 A:middle
the easier option is to use
the Dynamic ads feature.

00:17:28.476 --> 00:17:29.956 A:middle
And with this, all
you really have

00:17:29.956 --> 00:17:32.876 A:middle
to do is specify the frequency
with which you'd like ads

00:17:32.876 --> 00:17:35.476 A:middle
to appear, and the app will
handle placement for you.

00:17:36.296 --> 00:17:39.306 A:middle
And so far what we have is a
really good mobile experience

00:17:39.306 --> 00:17:42.446 A:middle
for the phone, but what happens
when we put this on the iPad?

00:17:43.826 --> 00:17:46.086 A:middle
So our mobile first
approach, at this point,

00:17:46.086 --> 00:17:48.646 A:middle
has left us with a few
design opportunities.

00:17:49.256 --> 00:17:53.246 A:middle
We could be definitely making
better use of white space.

00:17:54.476 --> 00:17:56.776 A:middle
And this is kind of like a
big, boring block of text.

00:17:56.776 --> 00:17:58.546 A:middle
It would be nice to
add some visual variety

00:17:58.546 --> 00:17:59.716 A:middle
to keep our readers engaged.

00:18:01.086 --> 00:18:03.446 A:middle
And, we have a really
bad line length problem,

00:18:03.866 --> 00:18:06.786 A:middle
especially when you put the
iPad into landscape orientation.

00:18:07.946 --> 00:18:10.086 A:middle
So the solution to all
these problems lies

00:18:10.086 --> 00:18:11.736 A:middle
in the Apple News
Format column system.

00:18:12.486 --> 00:18:15.936 A:middle
And this is really our
take on the classic problem

00:18:15.936 --> 00:18:18.666 A:middle
of the digital age, which is how
do you design for many screens.

00:18:19.566 --> 00:18:22.586 A:middle
And of course there are
some existing methodologies.

00:18:23.066 --> 00:18:24.546 A:middle
Notably, responsive design,

00:18:25.036 --> 00:18:26.626 A:middle
which you react to
your screen size.

00:18:27.636 --> 00:18:30.246 A:middle
There's mobile first design, in
which you enhance the experience

00:18:30.246 --> 00:18:31.296 A:middle
as you gain more real estate.

00:18:31.876 --> 00:18:34.026 A:middle
And these are both tried
and true approaches,

00:18:34.666 --> 00:18:37.596 A:middle
but making them actually
work is tough.

00:18:37.596 --> 00:18:39.066 A:middle
It's not easy.

00:18:39.066 --> 00:18:40.036 A:middle
And sometimes you end

00:18:40.146 --> 00:18:42.816 A:middle
up basically redesigning
your article, or your content

00:18:42.866 --> 00:18:44.636 A:middle
for different situations.

00:18:44.986 --> 00:18:47.296 A:middle
And with Apple News
Format, we really want you

00:18:47.296 --> 00:18:48.476 A:middle
to design your article once.

00:18:48.986 --> 00:18:51.486 A:middle
But more than that,
we want you to design

00:18:51.486 --> 00:18:52.666 A:middle
for the richest experience.

00:18:53.366 --> 00:18:55.626 A:middle
We want you to focus on the
big, beautiful version of it.

00:18:56.216 --> 00:18:59.126 A:middle
And we don't want you to get
caught up in media queries,

00:18:59.126 --> 00:19:02.926 A:middle
and breakpoints because the app
is inherently designed to handle

00:18:59.126 --> 00:19:02.926 A:middle
and breakpoints because the app
is inherently designed to handle

00:19:02.926 --> 00:19:04.106 A:middle
that kind of scaling for you.

00:19:04.816 --> 00:19:07.706 A:middle
So how does it work?

00:19:08.626 --> 00:19:11.596 A:middle
Well, it starts with an iPad
in landscape orientation.

00:19:12.366 --> 00:19:12.886 A:middle
Then what we're going

00:19:12.886 --> 00:19:16.626 A:middle
to as content creators is
divide the screen into columns.

00:19:17.206 --> 00:19:21.086 A:middle
Now, here I've divided it into
10, but as a content creator,

00:19:21.086 --> 00:19:22.746 A:middle
you get to choose how many
columns you want to use.

00:19:23.116 --> 00:19:25.206 A:middle
There's no hard and
fast mind on how many,

00:19:25.356 --> 00:19:28.416 A:middle
just keep in mind the
more columns you add,

00:19:29.086 --> 00:19:33.226 A:middle
the more complexity you're
adding to your design.

00:19:33.396 --> 00:19:35.736 A:middle
So, once we've decided how
many columns in total we want

00:19:35.736 --> 00:19:37.596 A:middle
for our article, next we have

00:19:37.716 --> 00:19:39.956 A:middle
to assign some columns
spans to the content.

00:19:41.256 --> 00:19:44.286 A:middle
So, in this example
here, our main block

00:19:44.286 --> 00:19:47.946 A:middle
of body content is consuming
the first 7 of our 10 columns.

00:19:49.306 --> 00:19:51.836 A:middle
And the caption on the
right is consuming the last.

00:19:51.836 --> 00:19:56.966 A:middle
So then when we take that
design, and we start looking

00:19:56.966 --> 00:19:58.926 A:middle
at it on different
orientations, different devices,

00:19:59.296 --> 00:20:02.266 A:middle
what we see is that the app
automatically collapses the

00:19:59.296 --> 00:20:02.266 A:middle
what we see is that the app
automatically collapses the

00:20:02.266 --> 00:20:04.736 A:middle
number of available columns
to fit the screen size.

00:20:05.326 --> 00:20:07.576 A:middle
And then likewise,
where the real magic is,

00:20:08.156 --> 00:20:12.696 A:middle
is how intelligently
decides, figure that how

00:20:12.696 --> 00:20:15.456 A:middle
to adapt the components to
that new amount of real estate.

00:20:16.286 --> 00:20:18.596 A:middle
So as you can see like when
you go to the iPad in portrait,

00:20:19.136 --> 00:20:21.546 A:middle
things get narrower,
but then on the phone

00:20:21.546 --> 00:20:22.566 A:middle
where that wouldn't
be appropriate,

00:20:23.336 --> 00:20:24.786 A:middle
everything falls back
into a stacking order.

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:30.666 A:middle
So at this point,
you could be tempted

00:20:30.666 --> 00:20:31.756 A:middle
to start doing some arithmetic.

00:20:31.756 --> 00:20:34.286 A:middle
Figuring out for such and
such screen width, with such

00:20:34.286 --> 00:20:38.836 A:middle
and such layout, what
would the column spans be?

00:20:39.036 --> 00:20:40.916 A:middle
That can get very complicated
and kind of annoying.

00:20:41.526 --> 00:20:43.946 A:middle
That's really not in the
spirit of Apple News Format.

00:20:44.226 --> 00:20:45.106 A:middle
Because we want you to focus

00:20:45.106 --> 00:20:47.426 A:middle
on the visual effects
of your designs.

00:20:48.356 --> 00:20:51.046 A:middle
To help you do that, we
made a great OS X app called

00:20:51.046 --> 00:20:51.706 A:middle
News Preview.

00:20:52.436 --> 00:20:57.296 A:middle
So as a designer, or developer,
or both, you need to be able

00:20:57.296 --> 00:20:59.356 A:middle
to iterate quickly in your
designs, and competently

00:20:59.356 --> 00:21:00.206 A:middle
and know they're
going to look great.

00:20:59.356 --> 00:21:00.206 A:middle
and know they're
going to look great.

00:21:00.206 --> 00:21:02.006 A:middle
And that's where News
Preview comes in.

00:21:02.006 --> 00:21:05.086 A:middle
Because it allows you to
see, get a visual update

00:21:05.086 --> 00:21:06.346 A:middle
on how your articles
are going to look,

00:21:07.386 --> 00:21:09.336 A:middle
while you're messing
around with the code.

00:21:09.876 --> 00:21:12.516 A:middle
And best of all it
leverages the Xcode simulator

00:21:12.716 --> 00:21:14.166 A:middle
so you can see multiple devices,

00:21:14.166 --> 00:21:16.756 A:middle
multiple orientations
all updating live,

00:21:16.956 --> 00:21:18.096 A:middle
simultaneously while you work.

00:21:19.366 --> 00:21:21.146 A:middle
And it's available for
all Apple developers

00:21:21.146 --> 00:21:24.586 A:middle
at developer.apple.com.

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:27.886 A:middle
So, returning to our JSON,
we talked about the concepts

00:21:27.886 --> 00:21:30.766 A:middle
of the column system, now let's
put how we actually make these

00:21:30.766 --> 00:21:32.376 A:middle
happen, in the article JSON.

00:21:32.376 --> 00:21:36.146 A:middle
So now we're going to go
back to our article skeleton,

00:21:36.486 --> 00:21:36.956 A:middle
we're going to look

00:21:36.956 --> 00:21:38.296 A:middle
at a top-level property
called layout.

00:21:38.936 --> 00:21:40.376 A:middle
And this is your
document layout.

00:21:40.786 --> 00:21:41.926 A:middle
It's got four properties.

00:21:42.796 --> 00:21:45.296 A:middle
And with these properties,
what you're saying is

00:21:45.396 --> 00:21:49.146 A:middle
for a given width, say 1024,
for an iPad in landscape,

00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:53.086 A:middle
I want to divide the
screen into 10 columns

00:21:53.726 --> 00:21:54.896 A:middle
with a 20-point gutter
in between.

00:21:54.896 --> 00:21:57.346 A:middle
And then to the left
and to the right,

00:21:57.346 --> 00:21:59.066 A:middle
I'm going to have
an 85-point margin.

00:21:59.066 --> 00:22:01.426 A:middle
And of course these
numbers are configurable,

00:21:59.066 --> 00:22:01.426 A:middle
And of course these
numbers are configurable,

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.476 A:middle
this is what was
chosen for this demo.

00:22:05.516 --> 00:22:07.676 A:middle
Next, once we have
our document layout,

00:22:08.066 --> 00:22:09.846 A:middle
now we need to start
applying some column spans

00:22:09.846 --> 00:22:11.036 A:middle
to our individual components.

00:22:11.646 --> 00:22:15.656 A:middle
And, because of the very obvious
line length legibility problem

00:22:15.656 --> 00:22:17.896 A:middle
we had with our body components,
I'm going to focus on those.

00:22:18.646 --> 00:22:21.966 A:middle
So, we see here on our
first body component,

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:23.766 A:middle
we're using a layout
named noMarginLayout.

00:22:24.056 --> 00:22:25.486 A:middle
So let's take a look
at that definition.

00:22:25.486 --> 00:22:29.116 A:middle
And let's add two
new properties.

00:22:29.896 --> 00:22:32.336 A:middle
Our first new property
is columnStart.

00:22:32.986 --> 00:22:35.866 A:middle
And this simply says, going from
left to right on the screen,

00:22:36.316 --> 00:22:38.816 A:middle
what's the first column that
this content should occupy.

00:22:39.656 --> 00:22:41.346 A:middle
I've chosen zero
my first column.

00:22:41.796 --> 00:22:46.236 A:middle
Then we have columnSpan, which
unsurprisingly is where you get

00:22:46.236 --> 00:22:49.256 A:middle
to say how many columns in
total this content should span.

00:22:50.096 --> 00:22:52.786 A:middle
And I've set it to 10, which
is also the total number

00:22:52.786 --> 00:22:54.426 A:middle
of columns in our document.

00:22:55.196 --> 00:22:56.436 A:middle
And you probably won't
be surprised to see

00:22:56.436 --> 00:22:57.776 A:middle
that nothing changed
in our article.

00:22:58.576 --> 00:23:01.766 A:middle
The default is for all
components to expand

00:22:58.576 --> 00:23:01.766 A:middle
The default is for all
components to expand

00:23:01.766 --> 00:23:03.186 A:middle
to the full-width
of their containers.

00:23:04.636 --> 00:23:05.766 A:middle
So let's make it
more interesting.

00:23:06.376 --> 00:23:09.906 A:middle
Let's implement a centered
layout for our 10-column layout.

00:23:11.076 --> 00:23:12.346 A:middle
That looks a lot better already.

00:23:13.126 --> 00:23:14.586 A:middle
So, what's going on here?

00:23:15.706 --> 00:23:18.186 A:middle
I've set it so that
the first column

00:23:18.186 --> 00:23:20.766 A:middle
that our body content
occupies is the third column

00:23:21.186 --> 00:23:22.146 A:middle
in our 10-column layout.

00:23:22.776 --> 00:23:24.236 A:middle
And of course if you start

00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:26.096 A:middle
from zero the third
column has an index of two.

00:23:26.456 --> 00:23:29.906 A:middle
And then I've reduced
the width of the content

00:23:29.906 --> 00:23:32.016 A:middle
so it only occupies six
out of our 10 columns.

00:23:32.626 --> 00:23:34.536 A:middle
And that looks pretty good.

00:23:34.726 --> 00:23:38.836 A:middle
But personally, I like a more
asymmetric design, so I'm going

00:23:38.836 --> 00:23:42.026 A:middle
to go ahead and kick it
over to left and switch it

00:23:42.026 --> 00:23:43.876 A:middle
to occupy the first
seven columns.

00:23:43.876 --> 00:23:48.436 A:middle
Now, if we take this
and we start applying it

00:23:48.436 --> 00:23:49.466 A:middle
to our other components,

00:23:50.426 --> 00:23:52.646 A:middle
starting to see our design
really come together.

00:23:53.646 --> 00:23:55.836 A:middle
We switch the orientation
it still looks great.

00:23:56.836 --> 00:23:58.686 A:middle
And we've retained that
awesome level of experience

00:23:58.686 --> 00:24:01.176 A:middle
that we had from the start.

00:23:58.686 --> 00:24:01.176 A:middle
that we had from the start.

00:24:02.316 --> 00:24:05.186 A:middle
So our one designed scaled
seamlessly across devices.

00:24:05.186 --> 00:24:06.406 A:middle
A piece of cake.

00:24:06.406 --> 00:24:10.746 A:middle
And now let's take that
foundation, let's build on it.

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:12.846 A:middle
So before we were talking
about the fact that we had kind

00:24:12.846 --> 00:24:14.616 A:middle
of a long block of
text, a little boring.

00:24:14.616 --> 00:24:16.716 A:middle
We can use some visual variety.

00:24:16.916 --> 00:24:18.266 A:middle
And of course the
classic solution

00:24:18.266 --> 00:24:20.116 A:middle
to that problem is
to add a pullquote.

00:24:20.676 --> 00:24:24.656 A:middle
So let's extract some text
from one of our body components

00:24:24.656 --> 00:24:26.496 A:middle
and let's drop a pullquote in.

00:24:27.716 --> 00:24:32.436 A:middle
Next, let's use our component
layout and take that pullquote

00:24:32.436 --> 00:24:35.996 A:middle
and just like push it
over into the margin.

00:24:36.116 --> 00:24:38.616 A:middle
So I chose a column start
and a column span value

00:24:38.876 --> 00:24:43.526 A:middle
to allow the pullquote to
clear all the body components.

00:24:43.526 --> 00:24:46.396 A:middle
And what you can see is
it successfully did that

00:24:46.396 --> 00:24:48.206 A:middle
and then it sort of floated
up until it hit and obstacle,

00:24:48.866 --> 00:24:50.276 A:middle
which isn't quite the
look we were going for.

00:24:51.076 --> 00:24:53.956 A:middle
So what we need is we need
to make a visual relationship

00:24:54.476 --> 00:24:56.426 A:middle
between our pullquote
and something.

00:24:56.996 --> 00:24:59.496 A:middle
And fortunately, we have an
inherent semantic relationship

00:25:00.016 --> 00:25:02.356 A:middle
between the pullquote
and the text

00:25:02.356 --> 00:25:03.316 A:middle
from which it was extracted.

00:25:03.846 --> 00:25:06.576 A:middle
So, what we're going
to do is we're going

00:25:06.576 --> 00:25:10.036 A:middle
to use something called
anchoring in Apple New Format,

00:25:10.396 --> 00:25:13.846 A:middle
and we're going to anchor our
pullquote to the body component

00:25:13.916 --> 00:25:15.766 A:middle
that contains the
text that we've pulled

00:25:15.766 --> 00:25:16.676 A:middle
out for the pullquote.

00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:20.336 A:middle
Step one in doing this is we're
going to add an identifier

00:25:20.336 --> 00:25:23.146 A:middle
to our body component
so we can call it out.

00:25:23.696 --> 00:25:25.416 A:middle
Then we're going to
add an anchor property

00:25:25.916 --> 00:25:26.996 A:middle
to our pullquote component.

00:25:27.426 --> 00:25:30.186 A:middle
And inside of there, that's
where we're going to call

00:25:30.186 --> 00:25:31.406 A:middle
out the identifier we just made.

00:25:32.356 --> 00:25:34.856 A:middle
And then we get to
define how do we want

00:25:34.856 --> 00:25:36.006 A:middle
to align these two things.

00:25:36.666 --> 00:25:38.636 A:middle
So in this case what
we're saying is we want

00:25:38.636 --> 00:25:41.976 A:middle
to align the top of our
origin, the pullquote,

00:25:42.926 --> 00:25:45.386 A:middle
to the top of our target,
the body component.

00:25:47.036 --> 00:25:49.896 A:middle
And once we do that, we
get a pretty cool effect.

00:25:50.056 --> 00:25:51.796 A:middle
We've got the pullquote
hanging out in the margin,

00:25:52.086 --> 00:25:54.026 A:middle
right next to it the most
relevant piece of content

00:25:54.026 --> 00:25:54.596 A:middle
that it could be near.

00:25:55.086 --> 00:25:57.126 A:middle
We have much more
interesting use of white space.

00:25:57.626 --> 00:26:00.656 A:middle
But because we have an
inherent textual relationship

00:25:57.626 --> 00:26:00.656 A:middle
But because we have an
inherent textual relationship

00:26:00.936 --> 00:26:02.066 A:middle
between the pullquote
and the text

00:26:02.276 --> 00:26:03.586 A:middle
from which it was extracted,

00:26:03.726 --> 00:26:05.816 A:middle
we can actually take
this another step further

00:26:06.546 --> 00:26:09.186 A:middle
and actually anchor
to the text itself.

00:26:09.596 --> 00:26:12.846 A:middle
So this is going to
be a two-step process.

00:26:13.076 --> 00:26:16.146 A:middle
First what we're going to do is
go back to our pullquote layout,

00:26:16.146 --> 00:26:18.306 A:middle
and we're going to update it

00:26:18.306 --> 00:26:20.866 A:middle
so that it overlaps the body
components by one column.

00:26:21.456 --> 00:26:24.766 A:middle
And then we're going to
call out the range of text

00:26:24.886 --> 00:26:26.606 A:middle
from which the pullquote
was extracted.

00:26:27.926 --> 00:26:31.676 A:middle
And once we do that, we get this
really cool sort of embedded

00:26:31.676 --> 00:26:33.936 A:middle
into the text pullquote look.

00:26:35.036 --> 00:26:38.896 A:middle
And then of course when
we take that and put it

00:26:38.896 --> 00:26:39.886 A:middle
on other orientations

00:26:39.886 --> 00:26:41.986 A:middle
and devices it always
does the right thing,

00:26:42.066 --> 00:26:45.586 A:middle
whether it's reducing the width,
or in the case of the phone,

00:26:46.056 --> 00:26:47.896 A:middle
falling back into a
logical stacking order.

00:26:48.776 --> 00:26:54.966 A:middle
So, at this point, things
are really coming together.

00:26:55.376 --> 00:26:57.956 A:middle
We could probably call it
quits and start using this

00:26:58.236 --> 00:26:59.636 A:middle
as a template for our content.

00:27:00.116 --> 00:27:03.506 A:middle
But if we look at the experience
of scrolling through our article

00:27:03.506 --> 00:27:07.276 A:middle
so far, it's kind of
missing something.

00:27:08.586 --> 00:27:12.136 A:middle
For instance, check out this
cool article from Harper's.

00:27:12.876 --> 00:27:15.926 A:middle
Now, watch how the body
content sort of slides

00:27:15.926 --> 00:27:17.306 A:middle
up over the lead image.

00:27:17.596 --> 00:27:20.706 A:middle
And how as you get to each
photo the fades in just

00:27:20.706 --> 00:27:21.646 A:middle
as it gets to the view port.

00:27:22.806 --> 00:27:23.636 A:middle
It's a really cool effect,

00:27:23.636 --> 00:27:25.456 A:middle
so I think we can take
some inspiration from them.

00:27:26.196 --> 00:27:28.216 A:middle
So let's add some
motion to our article.

00:27:28.216 --> 00:27:32.426 A:middle
What we're going to do today is
we're going to take advantage

00:27:32.426 --> 00:27:34.636 A:middle
of a really cool Apple News
Format feature called a

00:27:34.636 --> 00:27:35.346 A:middle
scene animation.

00:27:35.346 --> 00:27:40.926 A:middle
So, step one in doing this,
we're going to take our photo

00:27:41.096 --> 00:27:41.906 A:middle
and we're going to move it

00:27:41.906 --> 00:27:43.716 A:middle
so that it's the first
component in our article.

00:27:43.716 --> 00:27:46.256 A:middle
Now, next what we're
going to do is we're going

00:27:46.256 --> 00:27:47.606 A:middle
to do a little transformation.

00:27:47.986 --> 00:27:49.426 A:middle
We're going to take this photo.

00:27:49.426 --> 00:27:51.636 A:middle
We're going to change it
from being a photo component

00:27:52.086 --> 00:27:54.376 A:middle
to being a background
fill on a container.

00:27:55.926 --> 00:27:57.696 A:middle
So to do that first, we're
going to add a container.

00:27:57.966 --> 00:28:00.256 A:middle
And we're using a semantic
container component

00:27:57.966 --> 00:28:00.256 A:middle
And we're using a semantic
container component

00:28:00.256 --> 00:28:00.676 A:middle
called header.

00:28:01.766 --> 00:28:03.366 A:middle
Now, nothing actually changed

00:28:03.366 --> 00:28:04.766 A:middle
because we just have an
empty container there.

00:28:04.926 --> 00:28:07.676 A:middle
So for debugging purposes,
I'm going to go ahead

00:28:07.676 --> 00:28:09.916 A:middle
and add some height and
add a background color

00:28:10.106 --> 00:28:11.126 A:middle
so we can see our container.

00:28:12.446 --> 00:28:14.056 A:middle
There. Now we've got
a lovely gray box.

00:28:14.986 --> 00:28:16.546 A:middle
A few things to note
in the JSON here.

00:28:16.936 --> 00:28:19.076 A:middle
First of all, I added
the background color

00:28:19.376 --> 00:28:21.176 A:middle
with a new property
called style.

00:28:21.866 --> 00:28:23.826 A:middle
This allows us to find
a component style.

00:28:24.616 --> 00:28:25.996 A:middle
And component styles
give you access

00:28:26.026 --> 00:28:27.496 A:middle
to some higher level
design elements

00:28:27.496 --> 00:28:30.576 A:middle
like background fills
and borders.

00:28:31.156 --> 00:28:34.146 A:middle
The next interesting
thing here is the fact

00:28:34.146 --> 00:28:37.306 A:middle
that it actually
defined our style inline,

00:28:37.476 --> 00:28:39.636 A:middle
which is something I
haven't done before.

00:28:40.256 --> 00:28:43.316 A:middle
On a technical level,
there's really no difference

00:28:43.316 --> 00:28:47.176 A:middle
between defining things
inline, versus calling them

00:28:47.376 --> 00:28:50.056 A:middle
out elsewhere as
a main reference.

00:28:50.506 --> 00:28:53.186 A:middle
It's really just a matter of
organization and convenience.

00:28:53.576 --> 00:28:55.746 A:middle
And then we have our height.

00:28:56.406 --> 00:28:59.066 A:middle
So I've manipulated the
height on the container

00:28:59.226 --> 00:29:03.026 A:middle
with a property called
minimumHeight inside our

00:28:59.226 --> 00:29:03.026 A:middle
with a property called
minimumHeight inside our

00:29:03.026 --> 00:29:03.716 A:middle
component layout.

00:29:04.936 --> 00:29:08.866 A:middle
And I gave it a value of 44vmax.

00:29:09.016 --> 00:29:11.446 A:middle
And what that means is we
want this container to be

00:29:11.446 --> 00:29:15.206 A:middle
at least 44 percent of
the longest viewport side.

00:29:16.306 --> 00:29:20.086 A:middle
And this vmax unit is one of
several special sizing units

00:29:20.086 --> 00:29:24.156 A:middle
that are available
in Apple News Format.

00:29:24.206 --> 00:29:28.266 A:middle
So, now that we have our lovely
size gray box, let's go ahead

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:31.446 A:middle
and switch it from
being a background color

00:29:31.616 --> 00:29:32.706 A:middle
to being an image fill.

00:29:33.736 --> 00:29:34.786 A:middle
And doing this is
a piece of cake.

00:29:35.196 --> 00:29:38.296 A:middle
We just add a fill
property to our style.

00:29:38.436 --> 00:29:42.216 A:middle
And now that we have that,
we can get rid of our photo.

00:29:42.286 --> 00:29:43.956 A:middle
And we've completed
our transformation,

00:29:43.956 --> 00:29:46.096 A:middle
we're a little be closer
to our scene animation.

00:29:46.746 --> 00:29:49.566 A:middle
Next step, we need to
actually establish a scene.

00:29:49.966 --> 00:29:52.236 A:middle
And the way we're
going to do that is

00:29:52.236 --> 00:29:56.136 A:middle
by actually dividing our entire
article into two containers,

00:29:56.706 --> 00:29:58.336 A:middle
semantic containers
called sections.

00:29:59.846 --> 00:30:02.966 A:middle
So our first section is
going to be our scene,

00:29:59.846 --> 00:30:02.966 A:middle
So our first section is
going to be our scene,

00:30:02.966 --> 00:30:04.076 A:middle
where the animation
is going to happen.

00:30:04.206 --> 00:30:06.206 A:middle
So I'm going to put our
header container in there.

00:30:06.626 --> 00:30:09.486 A:middle
And then everything else in
the article, I'm going to dump

00:30:09.486 --> 00:30:10.566 A:middle
into our second section.

00:30:12.916 --> 00:30:14.546 A:middle
Now to make our scene
actually happen.

00:30:14.886 --> 00:30:17.036 A:middle
So, again, this is pretty easy.

00:30:17.036 --> 00:30:20.376 A:middle
You simply add a scene
property to the first section.

00:30:20.896 --> 00:30:23.376 A:middle
And then you define what
kind of animation you want.

00:30:23.956 --> 00:30:26.086 A:middle
And here, I'm using one
called fading sticky header.

00:30:26.736 --> 00:30:28.046 A:middle
And what that means
is it's going

00:30:28.046 --> 00:30:31.076 A:middle
to take our header container,
and as the user scrolls,

00:30:31.076 --> 00:30:32.806 A:middle
it's going to stick to
the top of the viewport,

00:30:32.806 --> 00:30:35.256 A:middle
the rest of the article is
going to slide up over it.

00:30:35.256 --> 00:30:38.876 A:middle
And then the background fill
on the header is going to fade.

00:30:39.056 --> 00:30:39.746 A:middle
Let's see it in action.

00:30:40.976 --> 00:30:41.716 A:middle
So here's our article.

00:30:42.046 --> 00:30:45.406 A:middle
User scrolls, and the text
slides up over the image

00:30:45.406 --> 00:30:46.296 A:middle
and starts to fade away.

00:30:47.246 --> 00:30:48.896 A:middle
That's the gist of the effect,

00:30:49.386 --> 00:30:51.566 A:middle
but it's not quite
what I was going for.

00:30:52.176 --> 00:30:55.016 A:middle
We have that naked text
is sort of sliding up over

00:30:55.016 --> 00:30:55.896 A:middle
and becoming illegible.

00:30:56.876 --> 00:30:57.756 A:middle
Not the effect I want.

00:30:58.576 --> 00:31:00.416 A:middle
Fortunately, the solution
is really, really easy.

00:30:58.576 --> 00:31:00.416 A:middle
Fortunately, the solution
is really, really easy.

00:31:01.016 --> 00:31:02.976 A:middle
All we need to do is
add a background color

00:31:03.166 --> 00:31:04.056 A:middle
to our second section.

00:31:04.056 --> 00:31:08.266 A:middle
We're just going to let the
rest of the content retain

00:31:08.266 --> 00:31:10.016 A:middle
that white background
and slide up over neatly.

00:31:10.506 --> 00:31:11.856 A:middle
So again, let's see
it in action.

00:31:12.526 --> 00:31:16.096 A:middle
So we still get our animation
with a fading background

00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:17.546 A:middle
but it's still legible.

00:31:17.896 --> 00:31:18.976 A:middle
Much better experience.

00:31:20.066 --> 00:31:22.096 A:middle
So now that we've
dialed in our animation,

00:31:22.886 --> 00:31:24.366 A:middle
we need to pay a
little more attention

00:31:24.366 --> 00:31:25.516 A:middle
to some design elements.

00:31:25.996 --> 00:31:29.016 A:middle
In our top of article experience
just to make it look nice.

00:31:29.586 --> 00:31:33.906 A:middle
And the first issue I'd
like to tackle is the fact

00:31:33.906 --> 00:31:35.456 A:middle
that when we moved our photo,

00:31:36.006 --> 00:31:38.726 A:middle
suddenly the captions got
this awkwardness and a bunch

00:31:38.726 --> 00:31:41.126 A:middle
of things between it and
the thing it describes.

00:31:41.796 --> 00:31:44.676 A:middle
And there are a few different
approaches to this problem.

00:31:45.246 --> 00:31:47.846 A:middle
The one I'm going to use today
is to take our anchoring skills

00:31:48.636 --> 00:31:51.056 A:middle
and sort of kick it
out into the margin.

00:31:51.546 --> 00:31:55.046 A:middle
So this has the effect of
making the association clearer

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:56.326 A:middle
with a clean vertical line.

00:31:56.816 --> 00:31:59.186 A:middle
But also, it makes our white
space a bit more interesting

00:31:59.186 --> 00:31:59.516 A:middle
up top.

00:32:00.186 --> 00:32:04.246 A:middle
And then the next thing
I want to do is I want

00:32:04.246 --> 00:32:06.686 A:middle
to take advantage of the fact
that we're using a container

00:32:06.686 --> 00:32:08.746 A:middle
with an image fill up top
now instead of a photo.

00:32:08.746 --> 00:32:11.556 A:middle
And one of the coolest
things about that is you get

00:32:11.556 --> 00:32:13.076 A:middle
to put things inside
of containers.

00:32:13.366 --> 00:32:14.016 A:middle
Mainly text.

00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:16.706 A:middle
Meaning we can layer some
text on top of the image,

00:32:17.246 --> 00:32:20.406 A:middle
and add a much more interesting
look to our top of article.

00:32:22.936 --> 00:32:27.566 A:middle
So, I've taken our title and the
caption, the heading above it,

00:32:27.566 --> 00:32:30.746 A:middle
and I've put them into
our header container,

00:32:32.196 --> 00:32:34.096 A:middle
which looks pretty cool,
except that now they're sort

00:32:34.096 --> 00:32:35.166 A:middle
of awkwardly floating up top.

00:32:35.506 --> 00:32:38.066 A:middle
It'd be nice if I could align
them to the bottom of that.

00:32:38.066 --> 00:32:41.546 A:middle
And I can, using another
ability of the anchor property.

00:32:42.836 --> 00:32:46.296 A:middle
So if you use an anchor
on an object that's inside

00:32:46.296 --> 00:32:48.546 A:middle
of a container, you get
to adjust the alignment

00:32:48.546 --> 00:32:50.056 A:middle
of it relative to its container.

00:32:50.666 --> 00:32:52.786 A:middle
So in this case I'm using
a target anchor position

00:32:52.786 --> 00:32:53.166 A:middle
at bottom.

00:32:53.656 --> 00:32:56.596 A:middle
And as you can see, my
text sticks to the bottom

00:32:56.596 --> 00:32:57.406 A:middle
of the header container.

00:32:57.966 --> 00:33:02.586 A:middle
And it looks a heck
of a lot better.

00:32:57.966 --> 00:33:02.586 A:middle
And it looks a heck
of a lot better.

00:33:02.766 --> 00:33:04.306 A:middle
So, we're really, really close.

00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:07.436 A:middle
We've got some interesting
layering of text over images,

00:33:07.436 --> 00:33:08.926 A:middle
we've got nice white
space usage,

00:33:08.926 --> 00:33:10.076 A:middle
we've got good topography.

00:33:10.696 --> 00:33:12.786 A:middle
The last thing I want to
do before I call our top

00:33:12.786 --> 00:33:15.136 A:middle
of article experience
done is I want

00:33:15.136 --> 00:33:16.426 A:middle
to add some inline text styles.

00:33:17.046 --> 00:33:20.466 A:middle
So we're going to go one more
time to your article skeleton.

00:33:20.466 --> 00:33:22.916 A:middle
And we're going to add a
new top-level dictionary

00:33:22.916 --> 00:33:23.846 A:middle
called textStyles.

00:33:24.696 --> 00:33:27.196 A:middle
And textStyles is similar
to componentTextStyles,

00:33:27.746 --> 00:33:30.746 A:middle
except that instead of styling
all the text in a component,

00:33:31.136 --> 00:33:33.116 A:middle
textStyles allows you to
do style to just a range

00:33:33.116 --> 00:33:35.956 A:middle
of text and make two styles.

00:33:37.026 --> 00:33:39.466 A:middle
One for gray text,
and one for bold text.

00:33:40.066 --> 00:33:42.906 A:middle
And to apply these I'm
going to take advantage

00:33:42.906 --> 00:33:45.146 A:middle
of a really cool
markdown extension we have

00:33:45.146 --> 00:33:45.956 A:middle
in Apple News Format.

00:33:47.246 --> 00:33:49.526 A:middle
So here's the two components
that I want to effect.

00:33:49.786 --> 00:33:52.596 A:middle
We've got our title component
and our first body component.

00:33:53.236 --> 00:33:59.266 A:middle
And to apply my stiles, all I
do is a wrap the text I want

00:33:59.266 --> 00:34:02.686 A:middle
to effect in square
brackets and I follow

00:33:59.266 --> 00:34:02.686 A:middle
to effect in square
brackets and I follow

00:34:02.686 --> 00:34:05.796 A:middle
that with the style I want
to apply in curly braces.

00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:10.366 A:middle
And once you do that, as you can
see in the case of the title,

00:34:10.556 --> 00:34:14.136 A:middle
I've given some gray text
color to a few of the words.

00:34:15.005 --> 00:34:18.136 A:middle
And then I've got a
nice run in bold look

00:34:18.346 --> 00:34:19.496 A:middle
for our first body component.

00:34:20.196 --> 00:34:23.496 A:middle
So, now I'm satisfied.

00:34:23.706 --> 00:34:26.346 A:middle
Ready to call our top of
article experience done.

00:34:27.235 --> 00:34:29.335 A:middle
There's just one more tweak I'd

00:34:29.335 --> 00:34:31.146 A:middle
like to make before I call
the whole article done.

00:34:31.146 --> 00:34:33.166 A:middle
I want to add some
motion to a few elements

00:34:33.166 --> 00:34:34.216 A:middle
that are further
down in the article.

00:34:34.636 --> 00:34:36.696 A:middle
So, for instance the
pullquote there on the right.

00:34:37.186 --> 00:34:39.016 A:middle
It'd be cool if that
slid in from the right.

00:34:40.646 --> 00:34:43.275 A:middle
And it would also be cool
if the galleries slide in.

00:34:44.146 --> 00:34:46.056 A:middle
But as for the mosaic
and the captions,

00:34:46.156 --> 00:34:48.416 A:middle
I think it would be cool as
if those faded in as you got

00:34:48.466 --> 00:34:49.426 A:middle
to them in the viewport.

00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:52.856 A:middle
So implementing this
is really, really easy.

00:34:53.646 --> 00:34:54.406 A:middle
Here's our pullquote.

00:34:55.335 --> 00:34:59.066 A:middle
And all I have to do to
add the animation is add an

00:34:59.066 --> 00:34:59.936 A:middle
animation property.

00:35:00.826 --> 00:35:02.226 A:middle
Inside I declare
what kind I want.

00:35:02.226 --> 00:35:03.896 A:middle
I want a move in
animation this time.

00:35:05.066 --> 00:35:07.236 A:middle
With move in, I get to say from
which direction it comes in.

00:35:07.236 --> 00:35:09.076 A:middle
I'm going to have it
slide in from the right.

00:35:09.076 --> 00:35:11.936 A:middle
Now, I'm going to
take that same thing

00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:13.266 A:middle
and apply it to our gallery.

00:35:13.266 --> 00:35:15.876 A:middle
Then I'm going to add
a fade in animation

00:35:15.876 --> 00:35:18.896 A:middle
to the mosaic, and
our two captions.

00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:20.666 A:middle
And let's see it
all come together.

00:35:21.076 --> 00:35:23.196 A:middle
So we've got our
scene animation,

00:35:23.686 --> 00:35:24.446 A:middle
here comes the pullquote.

00:35:26.216 --> 00:35:29.306 A:middle
Slide in. You can put
the gallery mosaic,

00:35:29.416 --> 00:35:30.386 A:middle
caption, fade, fade.

00:35:31.466 --> 00:35:32.246 A:middle
Looks a whole lot better.

00:35:33.216 --> 00:35:35.996 A:middle
With just a few animations
we made the act of scrolling

00:35:35.996 --> 00:35:38.216 A:middle
through the article more
fun and more dynamic.

00:35:39.146 --> 00:35:41.056 A:middle
And that seems like a
pretty appropriate place

00:35:41.646 --> 00:35:42.636 A:middle
to end our crash course

00:35:42.636 --> 00:35:44.166 A:middle
on the finer points
of Apple News Format.

00:35:44.626 --> 00:35:46.206 A:middle
So, we covered a lot.

00:35:46.546 --> 00:35:48.296 A:middle
We added some text
and graphical content.

00:35:48.426 --> 00:35:52.596 A:middle
We saw how to make layouts
that work across all devices.

00:35:53.856 --> 00:35:56.026 A:middle
We used anchoring to make
visual relationships.

00:35:57.206 --> 00:35:58.116 A:middle
And with just a few lines

00:35:58.116 --> 00:35:59.956 A:middle
of code we added some
really cool animations.

00:35:59.956 --> 00:36:03.166 A:middle
Of course this is just the tip
of the iceberg, I encourage you

00:35:59.956 --> 00:36:03.166 A:middle
Of course this is just the tip
of the iceberg, I encourage you

00:36:03.166 --> 00:36:04.946 A:middle
to download the tools,
check out the docs,

00:36:04.946 --> 00:36:06.026 A:middle
and play around with
it yourself.

00:36:06.026 --> 00:36:09.286 A:middle
We love to see what our
content creators come up with.

00:36:10.516 --> 00:36:10.976 A:middle
Back to Casey.
