00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:35.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:35.996 --> 00:00:38.636 A:middle
I'd like to welcome the
physicians who came here today

00:00:38.636 --> 00:00:42.746 A:middle
who also code and the developers
who are working with researchers

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:44.506 A:middle
to create great research apps.

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.726 A:middle
And of course, that includes
our students who are here today

00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:50.226 A:middle
who I know are already
using ResearchKit.

00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:51.556 A:middle
Welcome to all of you.

00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:54.756 A:middle
Would you like to see a
great ResearchKit app?

00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:55.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:58.866 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good, I'm glad there are at
least a couple of people awake

Autism &amp; Beyond from

00:01:04.936 --> 00:01:08.056 A:middle
Yes and we do have the Duke
developers here, so thank you.

00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:13.346 A:middle
Autism &amp; Beyond from Duke
Medicine is a study that seeks

00:01:13.346 --> 00:01:17.036 A:middle
to identify and understand the
risks for child development.

00:01:17.586 --> 00:01:23.186 A:middle
In this ResearchKit app a
young child views a video

00:01:23.936 --> 00:01:27.336 A:middle
and the forward facing camera
records their reaction.

00:01:28.016 --> 00:01:28.706 A:middle
Let's take a look.

00:01:35.106 --> 00:01:38.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The itsy bitsy spider
went up the water spout.

00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:43.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The app analyzes the video of
the child for emotional reaction

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:46.316 A:middle
and extracts facial expression.

00:01:47.626 --> 00:01:51.716 A:middle
One day a video like this might
be used to screen a young child

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:53.756 A:middle
in her own home for autism

00:01:53.756 --> 00:01:56.676 A:middle
and other mental health
challenges like anxiety.

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:00.736 A:middle
If the research is
successful, Duke will be able

00:02:00.736 --> 00:02:04.936 A:middle
to use science-based tools
to help parents understand

00:02:05.176 --> 00:02:06.896 A:middle
and support their
child's development.

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:11.466 A:middle
I think this app is pretty
amazing and it's just one

00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:13.026 A:middle
of the many apps that
have been created

00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:15.026 A:middle
over the past year
using ResearchKit.

00:02:16.146 --> 00:02:17.836 A:middle
Today, my colleague, Yuan Zhu,

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:19.776 A:middle
and I hope that we
can inspire you

00:02:19.826 --> 00:02:22.986 A:middle
to create other great
ResearchKit apps like this.

00:02:24.486 --> 00:02:27.396 A:middle
Today, we will go over the
new features in ResearchKit,

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:30.816 A:middle
we'll talk a little bit
about the contributions

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:33.216 A:middle
from the open source community
and how you can contribute.

00:02:34.256 --> 00:02:37.126 A:middle
But first, I'd like to start
with a recap of ResearchKit.

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:42.056 A:middle
We introduced ResearchKit over
a year ago and the aim was

00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:44.596 A:middle
to take the basic components
of clinical research

00:02:44.746 --> 00:02:46.756 A:middle
and to move them over
to the mobile world.

00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:50.396 A:middle
And those basic components
are informed consent,

00:02:51.176 --> 00:02:54.116 A:middle
survey tasks and active tasks.

00:02:55.556 --> 00:02:58.366 A:middle
It's pretty staggering to think
about the number of iPhones

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:01.176 A:middle
that are in the world
and how users like you


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:01.176 A:middle
that are in the world
and how users like you

00:03:01.406 --> 00:03:03.436 A:middle
and I can contribute
to research.

00:03:04.326 --> 00:03:06.626 A:middle
But there's some
significant differences

00:03:06.626 --> 00:03:09.086 A:middle
between clinical research
and the mobile world,

00:03:09.866 --> 00:03:12.176 A:middle
specifically in clinical
research.

00:03:12.646 --> 00:03:14.086 A:middle
The participant is right there

00:03:14.086 --> 00:03:16.236 A:middle
where the researcher can
see them and show them what

00:03:16.236 --> 00:03:17.146 A:middle
to do and be with them.

00:03:17.766 --> 00:03:20.806 A:middle
So when you move to the mobile
space there are some things

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:21.436 A:middle
to consider.

00:03:22.316 --> 00:03:24.226 A:middle
I'd like to go over
each of these components

00:03:24.226 --> 00:03:27.336 A:middle
and show you how
ResearchKit does them.

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:30.866 A:middle
Informed consent is
requirement for all studies

00:03:30.866 --> 00:03:32.166 A:middle
that use human subjects.

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:36.186 A:middle
Researchers are required to tell
participants what the study's

00:03:36.186 --> 00:03:38.956 A:middle
about, what data they're going
to collect, how they're going

00:03:38.956 --> 00:03:41.336 A:middle
to use the data, how they're
going to ensure privacy,

00:03:41.336 --> 00:03:44.506 A:middle
how the person can withdraw from
the study, and many more things.

00:03:45.706 --> 00:03:49.096 A:middle
So typically what
happens is that a person

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:52.856 A:middle
like in the Autism &amp; Beyond
study will be given a form

00:03:52.856 --> 00:03:53.716 A:middle
like this to read.

00:03:54.206 --> 00:03:56.186 A:middle
It's rather long because
if you were to put it end

00:03:56.186 --> 00:03:57.506 A:middle
to end it would be
taller than I am.

00:03:57.756 --> 00:04:01.056 A:middle
So it's a lot of text the
person needs to go through.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:57.756 --> 00:04:01.056 A:middle
So it's a lot of text the
person needs to go through.

00:04:01.886 --> 00:04:03.566 A:middle
So translating this

00:04:03.656 --> 00:04:07.766 A:middle
to ResearchKit we developed
an informed consent module

00:04:08.226 --> 00:04:10.566 A:middle
and what we do is we
split this large form

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:12.466 A:middle
into a series of screens.

00:04:13.126 --> 00:04:15.596 A:middle
On each screen it describes
that particular section,

00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:18.716 A:middle
gives an overview,
provides a learn more link

00:04:19.396 --> 00:04:22.586 A:middle
where the participant can drill
down and get more information

00:04:22.586 --> 00:04:25.746 A:middle
if they want to, as they're
doing here with withdrawing.

00:04:26.326 --> 00:04:29.056 A:middle
And then at the end everything
is put back together again

00:04:29.306 --> 00:04:32.726 A:middle
for one final review and
then the person can decide

00:04:32.726 --> 00:04:35.036 A:middle
to participate in
the study or not.

00:04:36.386 --> 00:04:39.236 A:middle
If they decide to participate in
the study, then they'll be asked

00:04:39.236 --> 00:04:43.526 A:middle
to give their name and sign an
electronic consent form just

00:04:43.526 --> 00:04:46.246 A:middle
as our most famous user, Johnny
Appleseed, is doing here.

00:04:47.826 --> 00:04:50.596 A:middle
Now what I want to point
out is if you're a developer

00:04:50.596 --> 00:04:53.546 A:middle
and you're doing your first
ResearchKit app you can't just

00:04:53.546 --> 00:04:56.066 A:middle
cut and paste this
text here that Duke has

00:04:56.066 --> 00:04:57.156 A:middle
or any other study has.

00:04:57.936 --> 00:05:00.946 A:middle
Informed consent
text is approved


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:57.936 --> 00:05:00.946 A:middle
Informed consent
text is approved

00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:04.406 A:middle
by an institutional review board
or ethics committee and you need

00:05:04.406 --> 00:05:05.736 A:middle
to use the text that
they give them.

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:09.446 A:middle
And you also have to like resist
the urge to be a creative writer

00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:13.196 A:middle
and to like, you know, I look
at these things and think wow,

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:15.776 A:middle
I can simply this, I can make
this really exciting to read.

00:05:16.086 --> 00:05:17.656 A:middle
But you don't want to
do that, you just want

00:05:17.736 --> 00:05:19.656 A:middle
to take what the researcher
gives you and make sure

00:05:19.656 --> 00:05:20.836 A:middle
that it has been approved.

00:05:21.256 --> 00:05:22.986 A:middle
So that's informed consent.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:30.036 A:middle
In clinical research researchers
typically have a participant do

00:05:30.036 --> 00:05:32.796 A:middle
at least one survey if only
to ask for demographic data.

00:05:33.096 --> 00:05:35.596 A:middle
But it's also quite
common for researchers

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:37.296 A:middle
to use standard surveys
like this,

00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:40.076 A:middle
the patient health
questionnaire or PHQ-9.

00:05:41.106 --> 00:05:43.416 A:middle
Now it's pretty easy to
translate a paper survey

00:05:43.416 --> 00:05:46.156 A:middle
into a mobile survey
and ResearchKit tries

00:05:46.156 --> 00:05:47.576 A:middle
to make this a little
bit more pleasant

00:05:47.576 --> 00:05:49.936 A:middle
by in most cases putting
one question per page.

00:05:50.676 --> 00:05:53.726 A:middle
And of course, we can support
anything that paper has in terms

00:05:53.726 --> 00:05:55.426 A:middle
of fill in the blank,
multiple-choice.

00:05:55.916 --> 00:05:58.936 A:middle
But because it is mobile
ResearchKit can do even more.

00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:00.536 A:middle
You can do your multiple-choice,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:00.536 A:middle
You can do your multiple-choice,

00:06:00.536 --> 00:06:02.276 A:middle
it can have a truly
sliding-scale where you have

00:06:02.276 --> 00:06:05.356 A:middle
to slide your finger, you can
give location as an answer

00:06:05.746 --> 00:06:07.846 A:middle
or date and time or images.

00:06:08.436 --> 00:06:10.976 A:middle
There are many, many
rich answer formats

00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:12.916 A:middle
in ResearchKit that
can be there.

00:06:13.516 --> 00:06:15.856 A:middle
Good, the date looks
right for me now.

00:06:17.996 --> 00:06:19.326 A:middle
So that was our survey tasks.

00:06:20.516 --> 00:06:23.696 A:middle
Now active tasks, in a clinical
setting a participant might be

00:06:23.696 --> 00:06:25.176 A:middle
asked to do something like walk,

00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:29.506 A:middle
so the researcher can
observe their gait or maybe

00:06:29.506 --> 00:06:31.836 A:middle
to solve a puzzle
or tell a story

00:06:31.836 --> 00:06:33.246 A:middle
for psychological research.

00:06:33.876 --> 00:06:35.406 A:middle
Or they might even
be asked to do things

00:06:35.406 --> 00:06:37.976 A:middle
like that require fine
motor coordination.

00:06:38.946 --> 00:06:41.166 A:middle
And again, in the clinic
you have somebody there

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:42.306 A:middle
to show you how to do it

00:06:42.306 --> 00:06:43.696 A:middle
and to make sure you're
doing it correctly.

00:06:43.696 --> 00:06:45.956 A:middle
So I'm going to show
you two tasks

00:06:45.956 --> 00:06:47.176 A:middle
so that you can get an idea

00:06:47.346 --> 00:06:49.666 A:middle
of how ResearchKit
handles active tasks.

00:06:51.316 --> 00:06:55.586 A:middle
The first is a voice task and
here the participant is asked

00:06:55.586 --> 00:06:58.126 A:middle
to say "ah" into the microphone

00:06:58.646 --> 00:07:03.146 A:middle
and then the app collects the
audio and analyzes it in any way


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.646 --> 00:07:03.146 A:middle
and then the app collects the
audio and analyzes it in any way

00:07:03.146 --> 00:07:05.406 A:middle
that is fit for that
particular research.

00:07:06.106 --> 00:07:08.856 A:middle
So this task has all the
components that can be

00:07:08.906 --> 00:07:10.746 A:middle
in an active task, so
let's go through them.

00:07:11.006 --> 00:07:14.066 A:middle
There is a page that
describes what the task is,

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:18.556 A:middle
that gives instructions to the
user on how to perform the task,

00:07:19.056 --> 00:07:21.686 A:middle
and a lot of active tasks
have a countdown timer.

00:07:22.246 --> 00:07:25.396 A:middle
And then some feedback
to the user

00:07:25.396 --> 00:07:27.476 A:middle
and in this case it's
saying that she's too loud,

00:07:27.946 --> 00:07:30.546 A:middle
so you can make sure that
you do the task correctly.

00:07:31.176 --> 00:07:33.586 A:middle
All the screens you
see, the animation,

00:07:33.746 --> 00:07:36.896 A:middle
the screen to screen navigation
are all provided by ResearchKit.

00:07:37.226 --> 00:07:40.136 A:middle
To get this task you
only need to use one call

00:07:40.136 --> 00:07:41.796 A:middle
in ResearchKit, it's that easy.

00:07:42.826 --> 00:07:43.626 A:middle
Here's another task.

00:07:44.386 --> 00:07:47.696 A:middle
This is a tapping speed task
where a user needs to tap back

00:07:47.696 --> 00:07:50.416 A:middle
and forth as fast as she
can during a given time.

00:07:51.286 --> 00:07:53.536 A:middle
But there are many, many
other tasks in ResearchKit,

00:07:53.746 --> 00:07:55.586 A:middle
including a walking task,

00:07:55.926 --> 00:07:58.076 A:middle
spatial memory task,
and there are others.

00:07:58.726 --> 00:08:02.436 A:middle
So those are active tasks.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.726 --> 00:08:02.436 A:middle
So those are active tasks.

00:08:04.336 --> 00:08:05.186 A:middle
From the first day

00:08:05.186 --> 00:08:08.716 A:middle
that ResearchKit was released it
was integrated with HealthKit.

00:08:09.836 --> 00:08:12.916 A:middle
It's very easy in Xcode to
add the HealthKit entitlement

00:08:12.916 --> 00:08:16.066 A:middle
to your app and it doesn't take
too many more lines of code

00:08:16.066 --> 00:08:18.886 A:middle
to get a screen like this
where you can ask the user

00:08:19.116 --> 00:08:20.946 A:middle
to have access to the
data in HealthKit.

00:08:21.906 --> 00:08:24.546 A:middle
When you do that you need to
specify the data that you want

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.936 A:middle
to read from and write
to the health app.

00:08:28.436 --> 00:08:31.026 A:middle
The user has the option to give
you permission for everything

00:08:31.026 --> 00:08:33.515 A:middle
that you ask for or she can
just give you permission

00:08:33.515 --> 00:08:34.616 A:middle
for specific pieces.

00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:39.586 A:middle
So I suggest that when you are
going to ask for access to data

00:08:39.856 --> 00:08:42.256 A:middle
that you ask only for the data
that you're absolutely going

00:08:42.256 --> 00:08:43.086 A:middle
to use in your research.

00:08:43.086 --> 00:08:47.566 A:middle
So don't ask for everything
and you'll have a better chance

00:08:47.566 --> 00:08:49.376 A:middle
of success of getting that
permission from the user.

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:54.426 A:middle
One of the big questions
that we got asked

00:08:54.426 --> 00:08:58.086 A:middle
over the past year is what does
ResearchKit do with the data,

00:08:58.486 --> 00:08:59.446 A:middle
where does it store it.

00:08:59.446 --> 00:09:01.616 A:middle
And that's really
easy for me to answer


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.446 --> 00:09:01.616 A:middle
And that's really
easy for me to answer

00:09:01.766 --> 00:09:03.776 A:middle
because ResearchKit doesn't
do anything with data.

00:09:05.196 --> 00:09:08.046 A:middle
If you were here for last year's
presentation on ResearchKit

00:09:08.936 --> 00:09:11.366 A:middle
where John Earl explained
the architecture

00:09:11.366 --> 00:09:14.176 A:middle
of ResearchKit he also talked
a lot about result objects.

00:09:15.176 --> 00:09:17.076 A:middle
And the short story is

00:09:17.076 --> 00:09:19.466 A:middle
that ResearchKit has
a results property

00:09:19.466 --> 00:09:20.676 A:middle
on the Task View controller

00:09:21.306 --> 00:09:23.456 A:middle
and it will hand you the
results in that property.

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:26.936 A:middle
But it's up to your app to
persist the data locally

00:09:27.816 --> 00:09:30.566 A:middle
and also for a research study
you want to send that data

00:09:30.566 --> 00:09:33.786 A:middle
to secure server where you
can aggregate and analyze it.

00:09:34.356 --> 00:09:37.336 A:middle
If you haven't watched
John Earl's presentation

00:09:37.336 --> 00:09:40.496 A:middle
from last year I suggest
that you do so because

00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:43.346 A:middle
in it he also shows how
to code informed consent,

00:09:43.576 --> 00:09:45.606 A:middle
survey tasks and active tasks.

00:09:46.346 --> 00:09:49.446 A:middle
But rather than have me
go over that coding today

00:09:49.496 --> 00:09:52.246 A:middle
because you can watch that
video I would like to bring

00:09:52.246 --> 00:09:55.486 A:middle
up my colleague, Yuan Zhu, who
can go over the new features

00:09:55.486 --> 00:09:58.996 A:middle
of ResearchKit and explain
to you how to code with them.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:00.086 --> 00:10:00.376 A:middle
Yuan.

00:10:01.516 --> 00:10:07.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:08.046 --> 00:10:08.566 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Bunny.

00:10:09.196 --> 00:10:11.066 A:middle
The open source community
discovers

00:10:11.066 --> 00:10:13.526 A:middle
that mobile research
needs more features

00:10:13.676 --> 00:10:14.986 A:middle
than research can provide it.

00:10:14.986 --> 00:10:18.196 A:middle
And we have been
collaborating with the community

00:10:18.376 --> 00:10:20.256 A:middle
to add more features
to ResearchKit.

00:10:21.696 --> 00:10:26.276 A:middle
So today, I'm really excited
to show you three of them.

00:10:27.276 --> 00:10:28.786 A:middle
First, branching task.

00:10:29.486 --> 00:10:31.156 A:middle
It can be confusing
on the paper,

00:10:31.716 --> 00:10:34.986 A:middle
but on mobile devices this
is really themed to the user.

00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:37.956 A:middle
Second, app access.

00:10:38.566 --> 00:10:42.606 A:middle
It protects user's privacy
and data, which is critical

00:10:42.756 --> 00:10:44.916 A:middle
to most of the research apps.

00:10:45.266 --> 00:10:46.396 A:middle
Last, charts.

00:10:47.506 --> 00:10:50.016 A:middle
Present the data in a
visual way to your user,

00:10:50.106 --> 00:10:52.616 A:middle
then your user can
understand the data better.

00:10:54.066 --> 00:11:00.986 A:middle
First, I will talk about the
first one, branching task.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:54.066 --> 00:11:00.986 A:middle
First, I will talk about the
first one, branching task.

00:11:01.576 --> 00:11:03.566 A:middle
Whether your app is
giving instructions,

00:11:04.026 --> 00:11:08.166 A:middle
presenting a survey or running
an active task everything

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:10.206 A:middle
in ResearchKit is a
collection of steps,

00:11:11.186 --> 00:11:12.676 A:middle
which together form a task

00:11:13.166 --> 00:11:15.376 A:middle
and the task can be
presented to the user.

00:11:15.526 --> 00:11:18.846 A:middle
With this model it's
quite straightforward

00:11:18.896 --> 00:11:22.476 A:middle
to create a linear task,
but branching task is not

00:11:22.476 --> 00:11:23.976 A:middle
that obvious how to create.

00:11:24.776 --> 00:11:25.966 A:middle
Let me show you an example.

00:11:26.606 --> 00:11:31.746 A:middle
What you see here is a
survey with three questions.

00:11:32.786 --> 00:11:36.576 A:middle
And apparently it only makes
sense to ask the second question

00:11:36.936 --> 00:11:39.026 A:middle
to the user who has
responded yes

00:11:39.286 --> 00:11:41.576 A:middle
to the first question,
do you own a car.

00:11:42.816 --> 00:11:43.786 A:middle
And the last question,

00:11:44.256 --> 00:11:46.876 A:middle
do you own a bicycle
should always be asked

00:11:46.876 --> 00:11:50.346 A:middle
at the end regardless the answer
to the first two questions.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:53.946 A:middle
Then you may wonder how
could I create this survey

00:11:54.006 --> 00:11:54.756 A:middle
in ResearchKit.

00:11:55.566 --> 00:12:00.536 A:middle
To help you do that I
introduce you a new class,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:55.566 --> 00:12:00.536 A:middle
To help you do that I
introduce you a new class,

00:12:00.776 --> 00:12:02.856 A:middle
ORKNavigableOrderTask.

00:12:03.886 --> 00:12:07.866 A:middle
Since it's a task, so it has
a collection of steps as well.

00:12:08.706 --> 00:12:12.976 A:middle
But besides that it also holds a
collection of navigation rules.

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:17.706 A:middle
The navigation rules defines
the branching logic in the task.

00:12:19.326 --> 00:12:22.436 A:middle
Next, I'm going to show you
how to use this new class

00:12:22.696 --> 00:12:24.686 A:middle
to present a survey
and just show to you

00:12:25.246 --> 00:12:26.766 A:middle
and it's really easy to use.

00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:33.176 A:middle
In the code first I need to
create those question steps.

00:12:33.946 --> 00:12:37.636 A:middle
Once I have the questions steps
I can create the navigable order

00:12:37.636 --> 00:12:38.936 A:middle
tasks with those steps.

00:12:39.576 --> 00:12:43.596 A:middle
As you can see, it's as easy
as create a linear task.

00:12:43.676 --> 00:12:47.606 A:middle
But after that I need to create
the navigation rule for it.

00:12:48.816 --> 00:12:51.696 A:middle
The navigation rule I'm
trying to create here is

00:12:51.696 --> 00:12:54.486 A:middle
to display own a
bicycle question right

00:12:54.486 --> 00:12:58.246 A:middle
after the own car question to
the people who don't have a car.

00:12:58.976 --> 00:13:03.166 A:middle
And I want to let you know
the navigation rule has


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:58.976 --> 00:13:03.166 A:middle
And I want to let you know
the navigation rule has

00:13:03.226 --> 00:13:04.066 A:middle
three elements.

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:08.866 A:middle
First, a trigger step, which
it triggers the navigation rule

00:13:08.866 --> 00:13:09.896 A:middle
to be evaluated.

00:13:10.876 --> 00:13:16.136 A:middle
Second, expected answer, so
expected answer here is no

00:13:16.266 --> 00:13:18.486 A:middle
to the first question,
do we own a car.

00:13:19.206 --> 00:13:22.866 A:middle
Last, it requires
a designation step.

00:13:23.236 --> 00:13:27.046 A:middle
Now you have learned the three
elements in the navigation rule.

00:13:27.606 --> 00:13:28.816 A:middle
Let me show you the code now.

00:13:29.446 --> 00:13:34.726 A:middle
In the code first I
use the resultSelector

00:13:34.956 --> 00:13:36.876 A:middle
to locate where is the result.

00:13:37.826 --> 00:13:41.236 A:middle
And then I create the predicate
with the expected answer.

00:13:42.556 --> 00:13:45.496 A:middle
After I have the predicate I
can create the navigation rule

00:13:45.806 --> 00:13:47.716 A:middle
with the destination step.

00:13:49.116 --> 00:13:53.006 A:middle
Last, I'll add the first
question, do you own a car,

00:13:53.286 --> 00:13:54.206 A:middle
to be the trigger step.

00:13:55.266 --> 00:13:57.966 A:middle
As you can see, it's
quite easy just one, two,

00:13:57.966 --> 00:14:00.166 A:middle
three I create this
navigation rule.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:57.966 --> 00:14:00.166 A:middle
three I create this
navigation rule.

00:14:00.846 --> 00:14:07.756 A:middle
And also the task is ready
to be presented to the user.

00:14:08.286 --> 00:14:11.596 A:middle
Now you have learned how
to use branching task.

00:14:11.906 --> 00:14:13.866 A:middle
Next, let me show
you the app access.

00:14:19.046 --> 00:14:21.666 A:middle
User account is a
very important aspect

00:14:21.666 --> 00:14:24.446 A:middle
of managing the user
in your app.

00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:26.986 A:middle
App access provide this
necessary functionality.

00:14:28.256 --> 00:14:33.386 A:middle
Two basic operations to
support account in your app,

00:14:33.386 --> 00:14:35.856 A:middle
account registration
and account login.

00:14:36.656 --> 00:14:41.046 A:middle
Account registration allows
your user to log in to register

00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:43.486 A:middle
with your app is
password and username.

00:14:44.376 --> 00:14:46.866 A:middle
And a registered user
can use account login

00:14:46.956 --> 00:14:50.686 A:middle
to continue participating in
your app even on a new device.

00:14:51.726 --> 00:14:52.586 A:middle
So that's account.

00:14:53.746 --> 00:14:56.596 A:middle
And you may know, user's privacy

00:14:56.596 --> 00:14:58.726 A:middle
and data security
are very important

00:14:58.836 --> 00:15:00.406 A:middle
for most of the research apps.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:14:58.836 --> 00:15:00.406 A:middle
for most of the research apps.

00:15:01.466 --> 00:15:05.096 A:middle
To help you do that we recommend
your app to allow the user

00:15:05.206 --> 00:15:06.446 A:middle
to set up a passcode [inaudible]

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:09.936 A:middle
and use it later
to unlock your app.

00:15:11.026 --> 00:15:14.666 A:middle
Same here there are two
basic operations in passcode.

00:15:15.226 --> 00:15:17.126 A:middle
First, passcode creation.

00:15:17.636 --> 00:15:20.356 A:middle
It lets user to select
a desired passcode.

00:15:21.266 --> 00:15:25.736 A:middle
Once the passcode is created,
then the app can assist the user

00:15:25.886 --> 00:15:28.646 A:middle
to enter the correct
passcode to enter the app

00:15:29.376 --> 00:15:31.556 A:middle
to use passcode authentication.

00:15:32.676 --> 00:15:35.096 A:middle
Now you have learned app
access has two parts,

00:15:35.906 --> 00:15:37.406 A:middle
account and passcode.

00:15:38.806 --> 00:15:40.246 A:middle
Let me show you the
account part first.

00:15:40.986 --> 00:15:47.446 A:middle
You see here it's a screenshot
of account registration.

00:15:48.876 --> 00:15:51.016 A:middle
It lets a user register
with your app

00:15:51.086 --> 00:15:52.696 A:middle
by providing an email address

00:15:53.076 --> 00:15:58.136 A:middle
and enter the possible
twice to avoid typos.

00:15:58.136 --> 00:15:59.726 A:middle
Next, I will show
you this in code.

00:15:59.726 --> 00:16:06.276 A:middle
All I need is to create one
step ORKRegistrationStep


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:59.726 --> 00:16:06.276 A:middle
All I need is to create one
step ORKRegistrationStep

00:16:06.926 --> 00:16:09.116 A:middle
with identifier, title and text.

00:16:10.016 --> 00:16:12.636 A:middle
And the last parameter
options can be used

00:16:12.636 --> 00:16:14.726 A:middle
to provide additional
input fields

00:16:15.066 --> 00:16:17.526 A:middle
like gender or date of birth.

00:16:18.736 --> 00:16:24.566 A:middle
Once I have this step I can put
it into a task and present it.

00:16:25.346 --> 00:16:29.396 A:middle
After the step is completed I
need to retrieve the username

00:16:29.636 --> 00:16:31.786 A:middle
and password from
the result object.

00:16:32.656 --> 00:16:33.636 A:middle
It's easy to do.

00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:37.166 A:middle
I just need to use the
predefined identifier

00:16:37.466 --> 00:16:39.236 A:middle
to get them.

00:16:39.236 --> 00:16:40.466 A:middle
Once I have the username

00:16:40.696 --> 00:16:44.086 A:middle
and password I can securely
send them to a remote server

00:16:44.616 --> 00:16:46.876 A:middle
to create the account
for the user.

00:16:48.146 --> 00:16:49.936 A:middle
So that's account registration.

00:16:50.506 --> 00:16:54.396 A:middle
Next, account login.

00:16:55.156 --> 00:16:57.666 A:middle
For the user who
already registered want

00:16:57.666 --> 00:17:00.206 A:middle
to continue participating
in your app.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:57.666 --> 00:17:00.206 A:middle
to continue participating
in your app.

00:17:02.056 --> 00:17:05.646 A:middle
You see here it's a
screenshot of the account login.

00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:10.026 A:middle
It allows a user to log in
with username and password.

00:17:11.016 --> 00:17:15.445 A:middle
Additionally, if a user forgot
his password there's a button

00:17:15.445 --> 00:17:19.536 A:middle
available for them
at the bottom.

00:17:19.536 --> 00:17:23.526 A:middle
We only need a few lines code
to create this in your app.

00:17:24.096 --> 00:17:28.165 A:middle
Same here, we need
a step ORKLoginStep.

00:17:28.906 --> 00:17:32.446 A:middle
I create this step with
identifier, title, and text.

00:17:33.266 --> 00:17:37.226 A:middle
And you may notice the
last parameter I need

00:17:37.226 --> 00:17:39.146 A:middle
to provide a
ViewControllerClass.

00:17:39.926 --> 00:17:45.366 A:middle
Why? Because I need to
subclass the view controller

00:17:45.366 --> 00:17:49.436 A:middle
from the ResearchKit to
provide my own custom handler

00:17:49.436 --> 00:17:54.396 A:middle
to the action forgot password in
case something forgot password

00:17:54.446 --> 00:17:55.526 A:middle
and click that button.

00:17:56.566 --> 00:17:57.826 A:middle
After I have done this,

00:17:57.956 --> 00:18:03.226 A:middle
then this login step is
ready to be presented.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:57.956 --> 00:18:03.226 A:middle
then this login step is
ready to be presented.

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:06.986 A:middle
Now I'm showing you account
registration and account login.

00:18:07.926 --> 00:18:11.206 A:middle
Next, let me show you how to
let your user create an account,

00:18:11.336 --> 00:18:14.886 A:middle
create a passcode and use
it to unlock your app later.

00:18:21.056 --> 00:18:25.366 A:middle
In the process of passcode
creation the user will be asked

00:18:25.606 --> 00:18:31.566 A:middle
to enter the passcode first,
then confirm it and optionally,

00:18:31.786 --> 00:18:35.146 A:middle
if the device has Touch ID
enabled the user can opt

00:18:35.146 --> 00:18:37.806 A:middle
in to use Touch ID to
unlock your app later.

00:18:38.936 --> 00:18:40.986 A:middle
You can see here a few steps,

00:18:41.256 --> 00:18:45.156 A:middle
but in the code it's
really easy to do.

00:18:45.386 --> 00:18:48.466 A:middle
Same I need one step,
ORKPasscodeStep

00:18:49.526 --> 00:18:52.136 A:middle
and after I create
it I recommend you

00:18:52.136 --> 00:18:56.776 A:middle
to provide a decryption text to
your user to explain the purpose

00:18:56.776 --> 00:18:58.246 A:middle
of setting up a passcode.

00:18:59.136 --> 00:19:00.406 A:middle
That's all I need to do.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:59.136 --> 00:19:00.406 A:middle
That's all I need to do.

00:19:02.046 --> 00:19:03.456 A:middle
Some of you may want to ask

00:19:03.886 --> 00:19:06.946 A:middle
where the passcode is being
stored, that's a good question.

00:19:07.416 --> 00:19:09.946 A:middle
Let me show you that.

00:19:10.146 --> 00:19:14.546 A:middle
From this diagram you can see
the passcode is being stored

00:19:14.546 --> 00:19:16.996 A:middle
in the iOS Keychain,
so it's secure

00:19:17.766 --> 00:19:20.636 A:middle
and also telling you
the passcode writing

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:24.186 A:middle
and passcode reading are both
managed by the ResearchKit,

00:19:24.686 --> 00:19:26.746 A:middle
so you don't need to
worry about it all.

00:19:26.986 --> 00:19:27.606 A:middle
Isn't that cool?

00:19:28.686 --> 00:19:28.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:19:29.156 --> 00:19:29.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:19:31.626 --> 00:19:34.876 A:middle
After you learn this let me show
you the passcode authentication.

00:19:35.306 --> 00:19:39.906 A:middle
The passcode authentication
allow the user

00:19:39.956 --> 00:19:43.886 A:middle
to enter the correct passcode
before accessing the app.

00:19:44.036 --> 00:19:46.906 A:middle
Let me show you the code.

00:19:47.116 --> 00:19:48.756 A:middle
All I need is a view controller.

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:51.146 A:middle
I can create this
view controller easily

00:19:51.656 --> 00:19:54.086 A:middle
and also I need to
remember assign a delegate

00:19:54.186 --> 00:19:55.276 A:middle
to it at the end.

00:19:56.306 --> 00:19:58.976 A:middle
I will show you next how
to implement this delegate.

00:19:59.716 --> 00:20:05.446 A:middle
The passcode authentication view
controller's delegate provides


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:59.716 --> 00:20:05.446 A:middle
The passcode authentication view
controller's delegate provides

00:20:05.756 --> 00:20:09.656 A:middle
opportunities to the developers
to handle the different result

00:20:09.956 --> 00:20:11.406 A:middle
of the possible authentication.

00:20:12.256 --> 00:20:16.506 A:middle
For example, if the passcode
authentication succeed I can

00:20:16.506 --> 00:20:18.226 A:middle
present that function
to the users.

00:20:19.186 --> 00:20:22.966 A:middle
But if the passcode
authentication failed I need

00:20:22.966 --> 00:20:28.006 A:middle
to show alert or the passcode
authentication is canceled I can

00:20:28.006 --> 00:20:30.366 A:middle
show the default welcome
screen to the user instead.

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:35.836 A:middle
So that's this delegate and also
this new controller is ready

00:20:35.836 --> 00:20:39.066 A:middle
to be displayed to the user.

00:20:39.236 --> 00:20:42.386 A:middle
Now I have showed you all
the parts in the app access,

00:20:42.386 --> 00:20:44.576 A:middle
I hope you find it useful.

00:20:45.586 --> 00:20:47.416 A:middle
I can show you the charts.

00:20:48.016 --> 00:20:50.486 A:middle
With charts you can present
your data to your user.

00:20:51.086 --> 00:20:54.896 A:middle
There are three types of charts
in ResearchKit, as you can see

00:20:54.896 --> 00:20:56.106 A:middle
from those screenshots.

00:20:56.876 --> 00:21:01.396 A:middle
There are pie charts, line
graph, and discrete graph.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:56.876 --> 00:21:01.396 A:middle
There are pie charts, line
graph, and discrete graph.

00:21:01.606 --> 00:21:03.866 A:middle
Let's zoom into the
first one, pie chart.

00:21:10.066 --> 00:21:11.636 A:middle
A pie chart is [inaudible] ring

00:21:11.766 --> 00:21:13.736 A:middle
and which is divided
into segments.

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:17.106 A:middle
Each of them represent a
proportion of the whole

00:21:17.716 --> 00:21:21.996 A:middle
and each segment has its
own value, color and title.

00:21:23.136 --> 00:21:24.476 A:middle
Once you have learned the basics

00:21:24.476 --> 00:21:27.886 A:middle
of this pie chart I can show
you the code behind this.

00:21:29.076 --> 00:21:33.206 A:middle
To code it I need to create
this pieChartView first,

00:21:33.936 --> 00:21:36.576 A:middle
then I'll assign a data
source object to it

00:21:37.536 --> 00:21:40.396 A:middle
because the data source object
provide all the information

00:21:40.546 --> 00:21:41.776 A:middle
to be displayed in the chart.

00:21:43.376 --> 00:21:46.196 A:middle
Now I need to implement
this data source,

00:21:47.106 --> 00:21:50.246 A:middle
but before I'm jumping
onto those functions I need

00:21:50.246 --> 00:21:53.796 A:middle
to take some time to set
up the data object first.

00:21:54.416 --> 00:21:59.476 A:middle
In order to do that I first
define a base structure

00:21:59.606 --> 00:22:02.966 A:middle
to carry the basic information
for each segment in the chart.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:59.606 --> 00:22:02.966 A:middle
to carry the basic information
for each segment in the chart.

00:22:04.636 --> 00:22:07.986 A:middle
You can see from here I
defined the base structure

00:22:08.166 --> 00:22:10.676 A:middle
with title, value, and color.

00:22:11.266 --> 00:22:13.066 A:middle
All the basic information
that is needed.

00:22:14.226 --> 00:22:17.006 A:middle
Once I have done that I
can create the data objects

00:22:17.206 --> 00:22:18.956 A:middle
with those structures.

00:22:20.186 --> 00:22:22.976 A:middle
Next, I will return
them in the functions.

00:22:23.636 --> 00:22:29.556 A:middle
Since I already have these
objects ready I can create those

00:22:29.556 --> 00:22:30.436 A:middle
functions easily.

00:22:30.956 --> 00:22:34.946 A:middle
First, I return the
total number of segments,

00:22:35.666 --> 00:22:39.606 A:middle
then I return the value of
each segment and the value

00:22:39.606 --> 00:22:42.656 A:middle
that will be used to calculate
the proportion in the ring.

00:22:43.836 --> 00:22:47.576 A:middle
After that is a color
and the title.

00:22:48.726 --> 00:22:50.486 A:middle
After I have done that,

00:22:51.516 --> 00:22:56.776 A:middle
then this pie chart is
ready to be displayed.

00:22:56.856 --> 00:23:00.356 A:middle
Now you have learned how to
use pie chart with ResearchKit.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:56.856 --> 00:23:00.356 A:middle
Now you have learned how to
use pie chart with ResearchKit.

00:23:01.566 --> 00:23:05.156 A:middle
And line graph and discrete
graph are quite similar to use.

00:23:05.796 --> 00:23:07.856 A:middle
You can simply go
to GitHub site,

00:23:08.196 --> 00:23:10.526 A:middle
download our simple
project to learn from it

00:23:11.036 --> 00:23:16.446 A:middle
and you can see the
URL on the screen.

00:23:16.906 --> 00:23:18.886 A:middle
Branching task, app access,

00:23:19.136 --> 00:23:21.966 A:middle
and charts are the three
new features I introduced

00:23:21.966 --> 00:23:22.456 A:middle
to you today.

00:23:23.276 --> 00:23:27.096 A:middle
With them I'm sure you will find
doing a research app will be

00:23:27.096 --> 00:23:27.866 A:middle
more easier.

00:23:29.626 --> 00:23:34.286 A:middle
Now I'm giving it back
to my colleague, Bunny,

00:23:34.776 --> 00:23:36.846 A:middle
to talk about contributing
to ResearchKit.

00:23:38.516 --> 00:23:42.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:45.046 --> 00:23:45.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The reason why
ResearchKit has

00:23:45.906 --> 00:23:47.536 A:middle
so many great new features is

00:23:47.566 --> 00:23:49.206 A:middle
because of our open
source community.

00:23:49.796 --> 00:23:51.566 A:middle
Many of our contributors
are here today

00:23:51.566 --> 00:23:52.536 A:middle
and I'd like to thank them.

00:23:53.326 --> 00:23:55.426 A:middle
But any of you out
there can work with us

00:23:55.456 --> 00:23:58.906 A:middle
to make ResearchKit even
better, so let me tell you how.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:00.026 --> 00:24:02.646 A:middle
Contributing to ResearchKit
is like contributing

00:24:02.646 --> 00:24:04.366 A:middle
to any other open
source project.

00:24:05.146 --> 00:24:08.266 A:middle
Go to our GitHub repo,
pick or open an issue

00:24:08.556 --> 00:24:09.746 A:middle
and please drop us a line

00:24:09.746 --> 00:24:10.876 A:middle
and let us know what
you're working on.

00:24:11.966 --> 00:24:13.246 A:middle
Then submit a pull request.

00:24:13.876 --> 00:24:16.716 A:middle
At that time Apple
engineers and active members

00:24:16.716 --> 00:24:19.246 A:middle
of the ResearchKit community
will take a look at your code

00:24:19.816 --> 00:24:21.576 A:middle
and no doubt they're
going to have some advice

00:24:21.576 --> 00:24:23.196 A:middle
for you on how to improve it.

00:24:23.606 --> 00:24:25.276 A:middle
So we want you to work
with the review team

00:24:25.276 --> 00:24:26.346 A:middle
until everyone's happy.

00:24:27.566 --> 00:24:30.486 A:middle
Then your changes will get
merged into the master branch.

00:24:32.796 --> 00:24:34.976 A:middle
Sometimes later we'll
branch for convergence.

00:24:35.596 --> 00:24:38.186 A:middle
At that time you code
will have been localized

00:24:38.186 --> 00:24:40.456 A:middle
into all the languages
that iOS supports,

00:24:41.266 --> 00:24:44.756 A:middle
updated for accessibility,
and tested on a wide variety

00:24:44.926 --> 00:24:46.946 A:middle
of devices and scenarios.

00:24:47.646 --> 00:24:49.076 A:middle
We'll also look at your code

00:24:49.076 --> 00:24:51.006 A:middle
with an eye towards
privacy and security.

00:24:52.486 --> 00:24:55.696 A:middle
Now this open source process
might seem a little Apple

00:24:55.696 --> 00:24:57.986 A:middle
centric to you, but
we want to make sure

00:24:57.986 --> 00:25:01.246 A:middle
that your code can be used all
over the world and by users


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:57.986 --> 00:25:01.246 A:middle
that your code can be used all
over the world and by users

00:25:01.246 --> 00:25:03.206 A:middle
who have a variety of
different abilities

00:25:03.466 --> 00:25:05.726 A:middle
and on a variety of
different devices.

00:25:06.936 --> 00:25:09.016 A:middle
So now that you know
how to contribute some

00:25:09.016 --> 00:25:11.536 A:middle
of you might have ideas of
what to contribute and others

00:25:11.596 --> 00:25:12.546 A:middle
of you maybe you don't,

00:25:12.546 --> 00:25:14.146 A:middle
so I'd like to give you
a little inspiration.

00:25:14.816 --> 00:25:20.606 A:middle
But before I do that we do tag a
new stable version at some point

00:25:20.606 --> 00:25:24.336 A:middle
and our last stable version is
Win.3 that we tagged in January.

00:25:26.116 --> 00:25:27.566 A:middle
Okay, so what can
you contribute?

00:25:27.756 --> 00:25:29.726 A:middle
Of course, you can
contribute active tasks,

00:25:29.726 --> 00:25:31.116 A:middle
I've already showed you a few.

00:25:32.236 --> 00:25:36.286 A:middle
This year we've had a 9-hole
peg test contributed and I'd

00:25:36.286 --> 00:25:38.186 A:middle
like to thank Julian
Therrier [assumed spelling]

00:25:38.186 --> 00:25:39.176 A:middle
for contributing that.

00:25:39.966 --> 00:25:43.176 A:middle
This task is supposed
to be a digital version

00:25:43.306 --> 00:25:44.916 A:middle
of a test that's
done in the clinic

00:25:44.916 --> 00:25:46.356 A:middle
for rehabilitation medicine

00:25:46.396 --> 00:25:48.476 A:middle
to test upper extremity
functioning.

00:25:49.376 --> 00:25:52.606 A:middle
Now right now this task
is undergoing validation

00:25:52.606 --> 00:25:55.256 A:middle
in a research study because
we don't really know whether

00:25:55.256 --> 00:25:57.426 A:middle
or not this digital
version is equivalent

00:25:57.426 --> 00:25:58.336 A:middle
to the one in the clinic.

00:25:58.846 --> 00:26:00.336 A:middle
So validation is
really important.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.846 --> 00:26:00.336 A:middle
So validation is
really important.

00:26:00.456 --> 00:26:03.866 A:middle
When you develop a new task
researchers want to know

00:26:04.076 --> 00:26:05.436 A:middle
that what you say it's measuring

00:26:05.486 --> 00:26:06.986 A:middle
that the task is
really measuring that.

00:26:06.986 --> 00:26:09.016 A:middle
So you might have to get
involved in a little bit

00:26:09.016 --> 00:26:10.426 A:middle
of validation study to do that.

00:26:11.866 --> 00:26:14.526 A:middle
The Tower of Hanoi is a
puzzle that's commonly used

00:26:14.526 --> 00:26:17.916 A:middle
in psychological research and
I'd like to thank James Cox

00:26:17.916 --> 00:26:18.916 A:middle
for this contribution.

00:26:19.836 --> 00:26:21.896 A:middle
I'm sure there are many
other tasks out there.

00:26:21.996 --> 00:26:24.906 A:middle
In fact, researchers often write
to me and say that they would

00:26:24.906 --> 00:26:28.286 A:middle
like things like maybe the
Stroop, which is the color test

00:26:28.686 --> 00:26:31.426 A:middle
or psychomotor vigilance task.

00:26:31.426 --> 00:26:32.696 A:middle
So there are many
things out there

00:26:32.816 --> 00:26:34.296 A:middle
that if you ask researchers
I'm sure

00:26:34.296 --> 00:26:36.436 A:middle
that you can develop
these tasks.

00:26:36.966 --> 00:26:40.956 A:middle
There are many other
answer formats than what's

00:26:40.956 --> 00:26:44.596 A:middle
in ResearchKit I'm sure and
I'd like to thank Quintiles

00:26:44.596 --> 00:26:46.766 A:middle
for giving us the
location answer format.

00:26:47.336 --> 00:26:53.066 A:middle
As you probably gathered
from Yuan, the basic thing

00:26:53.066 --> 00:26:57.236 A:middle
in ResearchKit is a step and
there are always many more steps

00:26:57.236 --> 00:26:58.326 A:middle
that could be contributed.

00:26:58.386 --> 00:27:00.046 A:middle
I'd like to thank
Quintiles once again

00:26:58.386 --> 00:27:00.046 A:middle
I'd like to thank
Quintiles once again

00:27:00.046 --> 00:27:01.906 A:middle
for contributing a wait step.

00:27:02.036 --> 00:27:05.276 A:middle
This step turns out
to be really important

00:27:05.276 --> 00:27:07.936 A:middle
when you're doing a very
lengthy calculation and you want

00:27:07.936 --> 00:27:09.836 A:middle
to get the results to the
user before they proceed

00:27:09.836 --> 00:27:13.756 A:middle
on with other steps in the task.

00:27:14.216 --> 00:27:17.556 A:middle
Modules are encapsulated
pieces of functionality

00:27:17.556 --> 00:27:18.476 A:middle
that help researchers.

00:27:19.066 --> 00:27:20.996 A:middle
Yuan just told you
about the charts module,

00:27:21.526 --> 00:27:23.736 A:middle
this is a great contribution
and I'd

00:27:23.736 --> 00:27:26.846 A:middle
like to thank Ricardo Sanchez
[inaudible] and James Cox

00:27:26.846 --> 00:27:27.866 A:middle
for contributing this.

00:27:28.566 --> 00:27:31.066 A:middle
Just about every new ResearchKit
app is using this module

00:27:31.266 --> 00:27:34.156 A:middle
and it turns out that users love
to see charts about their data,

00:27:34.156 --> 00:27:39.906 A:middle
their progress in the study,
and things about the study.

00:27:41.116 --> 00:27:43.636 A:middle
The genetic basis of
condition is of interest

00:27:43.636 --> 00:27:46.536 A:middle
to many researchers and right
now there are two ResearchKit

00:27:46.536 --> 00:27:48.206 A:middle
apps out there looking
at genetics.

00:27:48.776 --> 00:27:52.096 A:middle
PPD Act is looking
at the genetic basis

00:27:52.436 --> 00:27:54.016 A:middle
of postpartum depression
in women.

00:27:54.896 --> 00:27:57.936 A:middle
And MyHeart Counts recently
added a genetic component

00:27:57.936 --> 00:27:59.736 A:middle
so that they could
look at genetics

00:27:59.736 --> 00:28:00.916 A:middle
in cardiovascular health.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.736 --> 00:28:00.916 A:middle
in cardiovascular health.

00:28:00.966 --> 00:28:04.216 A:middle
It turns out if you want
to collect genetic material

00:28:04.216 --> 00:28:07.826 A:middle
from someone, there is an
informed consent process that's

00:28:07.826 --> 00:28:09.686 A:middle
above and beyond what's
required in your app.

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:14.676 A:middle
So I'd like to thank
23andMe for coming

00:28:14.676 --> 00:28:18.526 A:middle
up with the ResearchKit module
that shows how to do the --

00:28:18.526 --> 00:28:21.796 A:middle
that has informed consent in it.

00:28:21.796 --> 00:28:24.446 A:middle
And right now they're hosting
this on their own website,

00:28:24.446 --> 00:28:26.476 A:middle
so if you want to use 23andMe

00:28:26.476 --> 00:28:28.986 A:middle
to collect genetic data you
could go to their website

00:28:28.986 --> 00:28:30.786 A:middle
and get this ResearchKit module.

00:28:31.396 --> 00:28:33.866 A:middle
And the great thing is that
they have complete documentation

00:28:33.866 --> 00:28:36.186 A:middle
of how to add this to your
app and the modifications

00:28:36.186 --> 00:28:37.826 A:middle
that you need to make
in your app to make sure

00:28:37.826 --> 00:28:38.906 A:middle
that this works really well.

00:28:39.656 --> 00:28:41.906 A:middle
I'm sure there are other modules
that you could contribute.

00:28:42.026 --> 00:28:46.876 A:middle
Now as I mentioned before,
ResearchKit doesn't do anything

00:28:46.876 --> 00:28:49.876 A:middle
with your data, so you need to
connect it to a data service.

00:28:50.666 --> 00:28:54.256 A:middle
If you're someone who provides
data services I suggest

00:28:54.256 --> 00:28:58.566 A:middle
that you download our sample,
ORKSample and you modify it

00:28:58.566 --> 00:29:01.506 A:middle
to use your data service,
then host that modified app


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:58.566 --> 00:29:01.506 A:middle
to use your data service,
then host that modified app

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:04.296 A:middle
on a GitHub repo, so people
can come there and see how

00:29:04.296 --> 00:29:06.566 A:middle
to connect their ResearchKit
app to your data service.

00:29:06.946 --> 00:29:09.566 A:middle
It would be a great help to
researchers who are struggling

00:29:09.566 --> 00:29:11.256 A:middle
with trying to get that
data over to a server.

00:29:13.146 --> 00:29:16.496 A:middle
So after you've made all these
code contributions maybe you

00:29:16.496 --> 00:29:17.166 A:middle
want to do more.

00:29:18.546 --> 00:29:19.426 A:middle
I can see some of you.

00:29:21.076 --> 00:29:21.586 A:middle
If you've gone

00:29:21.586 --> 00:29:23.776 A:middle
to ResearchKit.org
recently you'll see

00:29:23.776 --> 00:29:25.706 A:middle
that we feature a number
of tutorials written

00:29:25.706 --> 00:29:26.996 A:middle
by the open source community.

00:29:27.446 --> 00:29:31.066 A:middle
Specifically, I'd like to thank
the [inaudible] Blog in France

00:29:31.786 --> 00:29:33.196 A:middle
and Raywenderlich.com.

00:29:35.476 --> 00:29:37.896 A:middle
We love to see developers
teaching other developers how

00:29:37.896 --> 00:29:38.226 A:middle
to code.

00:29:38.896 --> 00:29:41.406 A:middle
And if you're one of those rare
people who know how to code

00:29:41.406 --> 00:29:44.686 A:middle
and write, please find
a topic in ResearchKit

00:29:44.686 --> 00:29:47.106 A:middle
that you think needs
explaining and write a tutorial.

00:29:47.306 --> 00:29:48.416 A:middle
Then let us know about it

00:29:48.416 --> 00:29:49.736 A:middle
and we'll help you
to get out the word.

00:29:51.126 --> 00:29:53.846 A:middle
Now while the ResearchKit
community has been busy writing,

00:29:53.846 --> 00:29:54.726 A:middle
so has Apple.

00:29:56.166 --> 00:29:58.496 A:middle
We've updated the
ResearchKit programming guide

00:29:58.496 --> 00:30:00.846 A:middle
and reference documentation
earlier this year


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:58.496 --> 00:30:00.846 A:middle
and reference documentation
earlier this year

00:30:01.016 --> 00:30:02.686 A:middle
and we also added a chapter

00:30:02.726 --> 00:30:05.986 A:middle
to the iOS Human Interface
Guidelines to give you guidance

00:30:05.986 --> 00:30:07.616 A:middle
on how to write a
great ResearchKit app.

00:30:08.266 --> 00:30:10.346 A:middle
If you haven't read that,
please go out and do

00:30:10.346 --> 00:30:11.776 A:middle
so at your earliest convenience.

00:30:12.496 --> 00:30:15.376 A:middle
I have some homework for you.

00:30:16.046 --> 00:30:17.156 A:middle
This is your call to action.

00:30:17.726 --> 00:30:19.836 A:middle
If you haven't already
downloaded ResearchKit

00:30:19.906 --> 00:30:21.616 A:middle
framework, please do so today.

00:30:21.846 --> 00:30:23.526 A:middle
You'll get access all
the great new features

00:30:23.526 --> 00:30:24.486 A:middle
that Yuan talked about.

00:30:25.666 --> 00:30:28.306 A:middle
Inside the framework you'll
see a sample folder and in

00:30:28.306 --> 00:30:31.696 A:middle
that is the ORKSample app,
we added that this year.

00:30:32.116 --> 00:30:34.626 A:middle
I suggest that you build and
run it, it's a great app.

00:30:35.076 --> 00:30:38.456 A:middle
It's in Swift, it uses best
practices not only for Swift

00:30:38.526 --> 00:30:40.516 A:middle
and ResearchKit, but
for iOS in general.

00:30:41.356 --> 00:30:43.626 A:middle
It has a great architecture
for a ResearchKit app.

00:30:44.006 --> 00:30:45.426 A:middle
You can even start with that app

00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:48.956 A:middle
and you'll have a great
start on your own research.

00:30:50.196 --> 00:30:53.366 A:middle
Also build and run
the ORKCatalog app.

00:30:53.886 --> 00:30:55.886 A:middle
As its name suggests,
it's a catalog

00:30:55.996 --> 00:30:57.366 A:middle
of ResearchKit functionality.

00:30:58.066 --> 00:31:00.896 A:middle
When you run it you'll see
what each active task does,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:58.066 --> 00:31:00.896 A:middle
When you run it you'll see
what each active task does,

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:02.996 A:middle
you'll get a look at
all the answer formats,

00:31:03.136 --> 00:31:05.196 A:middle
you can even see what
an eligibility survey is

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:06.016 A:middle
like and more.

00:31:07.566 --> 00:31:10.066 A:middle
And finally, please
make a contribution.

00:31:10.106 --> 00:31:11.546 A:middle
ResearchKit is open source

00:31:11.546 --> 00:31:14.846 A:middle
and it will become
only what you make it.

00:31:15.636 --> 00:31:17.866 A:middle
Everything you need to get
started with ResearchKit is

00:31:17.866 --> 00:31:22.926 A:middle
on this page,
developer.apple.com/WWDC16/234.

00:31:23.306 --> 00:31:24.756 A:middle
There's links to
the GitHub repo,

00:31:25.046 --> 00:31:26.576 A:middle
to the tutorials I talked about,

00:31:26.576 --> 00:31:30.176 A:middle
to own documentation,
so please look at it.

00:31:31.706 --> 00:31:33.336 A:middle
This afternoon I'd
like you to join us

00:31:33.336 --> 00:31:35.236 A:middle
at the Getting Started
with CareKit session.

00:31:35.416 --> 00:31:38.356 A:middle
CareKit is a new open source
framework that we introduced

00:31:38.826 --> 00:31:42.266 A:middle
in March and that will help you
to build great apps for people

00:31:42.266 --> 00:31:43.506 A:middle
to manage their own care.

00:31:45.096 --> 00:31:47.976 A:middle
So with that, thank you and
have a great rest of WWDC.
