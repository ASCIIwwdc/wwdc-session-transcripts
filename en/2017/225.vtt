00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:29.706 --> 00:00:31.386 A:middle
I'm Chelsea Pugh and I'm an

00:00:31.386 --> 00:00:33.006 A:middle
engineer on the Safari team.

00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:36.016 A:middle
Welcome to session 225, What's

00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:37.666 A:middle
New in Safari View Controller.

00:00:38.856 --> 00:00:40.166 A:middle
Safari View Controller has a

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.326 A:middle
bunch of improvements on iOS 11.

00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:45.676 A:middle
It also has new APIs that were

00:00:45.676 --> 00:00:47.576 A:middle
inspired by feedback that we got

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:48.296 A:middle
from developers.

00:00:49.476 --> 00:00:51.176 A:middle
I'm really excited to share some

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:52.616 A:middle
of Safari View Controller's new

00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:56.696 A:middle
abilities with you today.

00:00:57.606 --> 00:00:59.656 A:middle
One main use case of displaying

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:02.066 A:middle
web content on iOS is to allow

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:02.066 A:middle
web content on iOS is to allow

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.436 A:middle
users to browse the web in your

00:01:05.826 --> 00:01:05.906 A:middle
app.

00:01:05.906 --> 00:01:07.716 A:middle
You might be displaying a list

00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:08.976 A:middle
of links that could lead the

00:01:08.976 --> 00:01:11.826 A:middle
user to news articles or maybe

00:01:11.826 --> 00:01:13.906 A:middle
your displaying a list of links

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:15.536 A:middle
that could lead to information

00:01:15.536 --> 00:01:17.276 A:middle
of different topics on the web.

00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:20.546 A:middle
It could, these links could your

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:22.266 A:middle
user anywhere on the web, and

00:01:22.486 --> 00:01:23.926 A:middle
you don't expect to know where

00:01:23.926 --> 00:01:25.216 A:middle
they'll end up ahead of time.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.366 A:middle
How many of you are doing

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:30.366 A:middle
something like this in your app?

00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:31.486 A:middle
All right, there's a few of you

00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:32.026 A:middle
out there.

00:01:32.446 --> 00:01:33.276 A:middle
You're in the right place.

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:37.166 A:middle
Another main reason that you'd

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.716 A:middle
want to display web content on

00:01:38.886 --> 00:01:41.206 A:middle
iOS is to allow your users to

00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:42.476 A:middle
get authenticated with a

00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:44.256 A:middle
third-party service so that it's

00:01:44.256 --> 00:01:45.866 A:middle
data can be used in your app.

00:01:46.546 --> 00:01:47.636 A:middle
How many of you do something

00:01:47.636 --> 00:01:48.456 A:middle
like that in your app?

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:51.196 A:middle
You're also in the right place.

00:01:53.276 --> 00:01:54.916 A:middle
And for those of you that are

00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:56.446 A:middle
providing those experiences to

00:01:56.446 --> 00:01:57.926 A:middle
your user, how many of you are

00:01:57.926 --> 00:01:59.436 A:middle
already using Safari View

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:00.026 A:middle
Controller?

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:00.026 A:middle
Controller?

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:03.366 A:middle
Great. If you're already using

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:05.126 A:middle
Safari View Controller, we have

00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:06.436 A:middle
some improvements to share with

00:02:06.436 --> 00:02:08.596 A:middle
you today that will make Safari

00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:09.996 A:middle
View Controller an even better

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:11.486 A:middle
experience for your users.

00:02:12.376 --> 00:02:13.806 A:middle
If you aren't using Safari View

00:02:13.806 --> 00:02:15.156 A:middle
Controller but you're providing

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:17.106 A:middle
one of those experiences, listen

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:17.903 A:middle
up.

00:02:17.903 --> 00:02:19.136 A:middle
The new APIs that we're going to

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:21.086 A:middle
talk about today were inspired

00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:23.016 A:middle
by feedback from you, and we

00:02:23.016 --> 00:02:24.226 A:middle
think you'll really like to hear

00:02:24.226 --> 00:02:24.656 A:middle
about it.

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.206 A:middle
Today I'm going to cover

00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:31.146 A:middle
displaying web content on iOS.

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:33.806 A:middle
Then I'll talk about how to

00:02:33.806 --> 00:02:35.176 A:middle
really match your app's style

00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:36.726 A:middle
using Safari View Controller.

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.666 A:middle
I'll then talk about some

00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:40.946 A:middle
improvements to Safari View

00:02:40.946 --> 00:02:42.526 A:middle
Controller on iOS 11.

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:45.386 A:middle
Then I'll discuss the new APIs

00:02:45.386 --> 00:02:47.446 A:middle
that have been added to Safari

00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:49.376 A:middle
View Controller to really tailor

00:02:49.376 --> 00:02:51.066 A:middle
it to fit your app's use case.

00:02:53.486 --> 00:02:55.156 A:middle
First, displaying web content.

00:02:55.946 --> 00:02:56.956 A:middle
There are a couple of different

00:02:56.956 --> 00:02:58.366 A:middle
ways, but today I'm going to

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:00.236 A:middle
talk about two of those, using

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:00.236 A:middle
talk about two of those, using

00:03:00.236 --> 00:03:02.036 A:middle
SFSafariViewController and using

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:02.966 A:middle
WKWebView.

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:05.736 A:middle
To start off, let's talk about

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:07.176 A:middle
SFSafariViewController.

00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:10.096 A:middle
If you don't know where your

00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:12.446 A:middle
user will be going on the web,

00:03:12.596 --> 00:03:14.196 A:middle
Safari View Controller is really

00:03:14.196 --> 00:03:15.516 A:middle
a good thing for you to use.

00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:17.706 A:middle
It gives you standard browsing

00:03:17.706 --> 00:03:19.196 A:middle
features so you don't need to

00:03:19.196 --> 00:03:20.586 A:middle
worry about implementing an

00:03:20.616 --> 00:03:21.666 A:middle
in-app web browser.

00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:24.086 A:middle
With just a couple lines of

00:03:24.226 --> 00:03:25.876 A:middle
code, you get an in-app web

00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:27.306 A:middle
browser with all of the features

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:28.646 A:middle
that your users know and love

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:30.636 A:middle
from Safari in your app.

00:03:32.206 --> 00:03:33.816 A:middle
Safari View Controller is also

00:03:33.816 --> 00:03:34.926 A:middle
great for getting users

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:36.516 A:middle
authenticated to a third-party

00:03:36.576 --> 00:03:36.856 A:middle
service.

00:03:38.016 --> 00:03:39.676 A:middle
It has the security that users

00:03:39.676 --> 00:03:41.636 A:middle
need while logging in and it has

00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:43.126 A:middle
features that can help them get

00:03:43.126 --> 00:03:44.046 A:middle
logged in quickly.

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:46.326 A:middle
One main example is Password

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:47.016 A:middle
AutoFill.

00:03:47.376 --> 00:03:48.496 A:middle
They can quickly fill their

00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:50.446 A:middle
saved passwords from Safari and

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:51.986 A:middle
log in with a tap of a button.

00:03:54.946 --> 00:03:57.136 A:middle
Now let's talk about WKWebView.

00:03:57.916 --> 00:03:59.566 A:middle
If you don't know the web, or if

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:00.836 A:middle
you know the content that you'll

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:00.836 A:middle
you know the content that you'll

00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:02.666 A:middle
be displaying to users ahead of

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:04.296 A:middle
time, or you even have control

00:04:04.296 --> 00:04:06.556 A:middle
over the web content, WKWebView

00:04:06.556 --> 00:04:07.626 A:middle
might be right for you.

00:04:08.386 --> 00:04:09.806 A:middle
It allows you to manipulate the

00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:11.566 A:middle
DOM using Javascript.

00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:13.676 A:middle
You can also customize

00:04:13.676 --> 00:04:15.766 A:middle
navigations by blocking or

00:04:15.766 --> 00:04:16.706 A:middle
modifying them.

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:19.846 A:middle
It's a view of web content, so

00:04:19.846 --> 00:04:21.396 A:middle
you can add your own native UI

00:04:21.676 --> 00:04:22.796 A:middle
around the web content.

00:04:23.386 --> 00:04:25.126 A:middle
This is great if part of your

00:04:25.126 --> 00:04:26.646 A:middle
app's UI is implemented using

00:04:26.646 --> 00:04:27.676 A:middle
web technologies.

00:04:28.816 --> 00:04:30.176 A:middle
The web content can blend

00:04:30.296 --> 00:04:31.636 A:middle
seamlessly in with your app's

00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:33.626 A:middle
native UI, so users don't even

00:04:33.626 --> 00:04:35.076 A:middle
need to know that they're

00:04:35.076 --> 00:04:36.386 A:middle
interacting with web content.

00:04:38.466 --> 00:04:39.716 A:middle
But let's get back to Safari

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:40.836 A:middle
View Controller since I think

00:04:40.836 --> 00:04:41.746 A:middle
that's why you're all here.

00:04:44.136 --> 00:04:45.266 A:middle
Safari View Controller makes

00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:46.616 A:middle
in-app web browsing easy.

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:48.156 A:middle
As I mentioned before, with just

00:04:48.156 --> 00:04:49.796 A:middle
a couple lines of code, you've

00:04:49.796 --> 00:04:51.566 A:middle
got a fully featured web browser

00:04:51.566 --> 00:04:54.866 A:middle
within your app.

00:04:54.866 --> 00:04:56.496 A:middle
It provides a secure and safe

00:04:56.566 --> 00:04:58.236 A:middle
browsing experience for users.

00:04:59.236 --> 00:05:00.636 A:middle
Let me tell you about a few of

00:04:59.236 --> 00:05:00.636 A:middle
Let me tell you about a few of

00:05:00.636 --> 00:05:02.286 A:middle
the security features you get

00:05:02.286 --> 00:05:03.516 A:middle
with Safari View Controller.

00:05:04.936 --> 00:05:06.726 A:middle
First, process separation.

00:05:07.426 --> 00:05:08.786 A:middle
There's your app's content and

00:05:08.786 --> 00:05:09.776 A:middle
then there's web content.

00:05:10.826 --> 00:05:12.296 A:middle
Safari View Controller is in a

00:05:12.406 --> 00:05:14.376 A:middle
separate process from your app.

00:05:14.896 --> 00:05:16.876 A:middle
This means that anything that

00:05:16.876 --> 00:05:18.966 A:middle
the user does on the web won't

00:05:18.966 --> 00:05:20.256 A:middle
have an effect on your app's

00:05:20.346 --> 00:05:20.706 A:middle
content.

00:05:21.436 --> 00:05:23.636 A:middle
If they browse to malicious web

00:05:23.676 --> 00:05:25.566 A:middle
page it won't be able to affect

00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:26.386 A:middle
your app's data.

00:05:27.256 --> 00:05:28.416 A:middle
You get out of the business of

00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:30.226 A:middle
taking care of user security on

00:05:30.226 --> 00:05:31.896 A:middle
the web because Safari View

00:05:31.896 --> 00:05:33.296 A:middle
Controller will take care of

00:05:33.296 --> 00:05:34.016 A:middle
that for you.

00:05:34.886 --> 00:05:36.526 A:middle
It provides critical security

00:05:36.556 --> 00:05:37.056 A:middle
features.

00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:39.216 A:middle
Let's talk about a couple of

00:05:39.296 --> 00:05:39.386 A:middle
those.

00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:43.256 A:middle
The lock icon here indicates to

00:05:43.256 --> 00:05:44.346 A:middle
the user that they're browsing

00:05:44.346 --> 00:05:45.686 A:middle
over a secure connection.

00:05:46.126 --> 00:05:47.336 A:middle
This is a really important

00:05:47.386 --> 00:05:48.606 A:middle
feature in a browser.

00:05:49.156 --> 00:05:50.096 A:middle
And you don't need to worry

00:05:50.096 --> 00:05:51.446 A:middle
about implementing it if you use

00:05:51.446 --> 00:05:52.826 A:middle
Safari View Controller for your

00:05:52.826 --> 00:05:53.866 A:middle
in-app web browser.

00:05:55.286 --> 00:05:57.136 A:middle
Safari View Controller will also

00:05:57.136 --> 00:05:58.576 A:middle
warn users if they might be

00:05:58.576 --> 00:06:00.156 A:middle
trying to navigate to a page

00:05:58.576 --> 00:06:00.156 A:middle
trying to navigate to a page

00:06:00.156 --> 00:06:01.376 A:middle
that's going to try to steal

00:06:01.376 --> 00:06:02.316 A:middle
their information.

00:06:02.986 --> 00:06:04.546 A:middle
This page is trying to imitate

00:06:04.546 --> 00:06:06.346 A:middle
example.com to get my

00:06:06.416 --> 00:06:07.036 A:middle
information.

00:06:07.036 --> 00:06:09.646 A:middle
And you get features from

00:06:09.646 --> 00:06:10.236 A:middle
Safari.

00:06:10.506 --> 00:06:11.996 A:middle
Let me just highlight a few of

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:13.136 A:middle
the features that you'll get

00:06:13.256 --> 00:06:14.526 A:middle
with Safari View Controller.

00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:17.766 A:middle
You get AutoFill of passwords,

00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:19.456 A:middle
contact info, and credit cards.

00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:21.946 A:middle
Users can quickly fill out forms

00:06:21.946 --> 00:06:22.536 A:middle
on the web.

00:06:24.546 --> 00:06:26.506 A:middle
Reader is an awesome feature for

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:27.806 A:middle
decluttering articles on the

00:06:27.806 --> 00:06:28.136 A:middle
web.

00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:30.166 A:middle
Our users of this feature love

00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:31.536 A:middle
it, and they'll love getting to

00:06:31.536 --> 00:06:32.616 A:middle
use it in your app.

00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:36.246 A:middle
ApplePay on the web can help

00:06:36.246 --> 00:06:37.866 A:middle
users quickly make payments

00:06:38.186 --> 00:06:39.876 A:middle
while shopping on the web within

00:06:39.876 --> 00:06:43.156 A:middle
your app.

00:06:43.156 --> 00:06:44.446 A:middle
And users get access to the

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:46.106 A:middle
Share Sheet that they get

00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:47.156 A:middle
elsewhere on the system.

00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:49.406 A:middle
They get access to some standard

00:06:49.466 --> 00:06:50.536 A:middle
system activities that they

00:06:50.536 --> 00:06:52.106 A:middle
might want to perform, as well

00:06:52.106 --> 00:06:53.836 A:middle
as any third-party extensions

00:06:53.936 --> 00:06:55.286 A:middle
that they have access to in

00:06:55.286 --> 00:06:55.816 A:middle
Safari.

00:06:57.866 --> 00:06:59.196 A:middle
And they get content blocker

00:06:59.196 --> 00:07:00.896 A:middle
extensions that they'd have in

00:06:59.196 --> 00:07:00.896 A:middle
extensions that they'd have in

00:07:00.946 --> 00:07:01.466 A:middle
Safari.

00:07:01.986 --> 00:07:02.846 A:middle
This means they won't be

00:07:02.846 --> 00:07:04.306 A:middle
confused about why their

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:05.766 A:middle
ad-blocker isn't working when

00:07:05.766 --> 00:07:09.326 A:middle
browsing the web in your app.

00:07:09.326 --> 00:07:10.546 A:middle
And there are so many other

00:07:10.546 --> 00:07:12.356 A:middle
features that you get by

00:07:12.356 --> 00:07:13.476 A:middle
implementing Safari View

00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:15.306 A:middle
Controller as your in-app web

00:07:15.336 --> 00:07:15.816 A:middle
browser.

00:07:17.946 --> 00:07:19.566 A:middle
Now, I'd like to talk to you

00:07:19.746 --> 00:07:21.146 A:middle
about how you can better match

00:07:21.146 --> 00:07:23.026 A:middle
your app's style with Safari

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.676 A:middle
View Controller on iOS 11.

00:07:25.156 --> 00:07:26.486 A:middle
There are a couple of new ways.

00:07:27.846 --> 00:07:29.366 A:middle
First, it has a new look.

00:07:30.236 --> 00:07:31.556 A:middle
If you've seen Safari View

00:07:31.556 --> 00:07:33.786 A:middle
Controller prior to iOS 11 you

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:34.656 A:middle
might have noticed that it

00:07:34.656 --> 00:07:36.046 A:middle
looked a lot like Safari.

00:07:36.776 --> 00:07:38.796 A:middle
Let's take a look on iOS 11.

00:07:39.966 --> 00:07:41.526 A:middle
It looks more like an in-app web

00:07:41.526 --> 00:07:43.176 A:middle
browser so users don't feel like

00:07:43.176 --> 00:07:44.576 A:middle
they've jumped out of your app.

00:07:45.066 --> 00:07:46.726 A:middle
This is the design on iPhone.

00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:49.356 A:middle
It looks great on iPad too.

00:07:51.746 --> 00:07:53.406 A:middle
Now I want to talk to you about

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:55.246 A:middle
customizing the color of Safari

00:07:55.246 --> 00:07:56.976 A:middle
View Controller so that it fits

00:07:57.016 --> 00:07:58.456 A:middle
with your app's color scheme.

00:07:59.196 --> 00:08:00.846 A:middle
The ability to customize Safari

00:07:59.196 --> 00:08:00.846 A:middle
The ability to customize Safari

00:08:00.846 --> 00:08:01.906 A:middle
View Controller's color was

00:08:01.906 --> 00:08:04.356 A:middle
available prior to iOS 11, but

00:08:04.606 --> 00:08:05.836 A:middle
we've made an improvement that I

00:08:05.836 --> 00:08:07.086 A:middle
really want you to know about.

00:08:08.516 --> 00:08:09.626 A:middle
First, let's recap the

00:08:09.626 --> 00:08:10.666 A:middle
customizations.

00:08:11.516 --> 00:08:12.916 A:middle
This is a default Safari View

00:08:12.916 --> 00:08:13.496 A:middle
Controller.

00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:15.126 A:middle
It has the same color scheme as

00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:16.606 A:middle
Safari, blue and white.

00:08:17.156 --> 00:08:18.386 A:middle
But let's say my app has a

00:08:18.386 --> 00:08:19.796 A:middle
different color scheme, black

00:08:19.796 --> 00:08:20.286 A:middle
and aqua.

00:08:22.046 --> 00:08:23.796 A:middle
Here I started using my app's

00:08:23.906 --> 00:08:25.176 A:middle
color scheme in Safari View

00:08:25.176 --> 00:08:25.756 A:middle
Controller.

00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:27.396 A:middle
So, when I present Safari View

00:08:27.396 --> 00:08:28.946 A:middle
Controller to my users it

00:08:28.946 --> 00:08:30.116 A:middle
doesn't feel like they've left

00:08:30.116 --> 00:08:31.366 A:middle
my app.

00:08:31.366 --> 00:08:32.476 A:middle
And it's a really seamless

00:08:32.476 --> 00:08:33.166 A:middle
experience.

00:08:34.926 --> 00:08:36.246 A:middle
You can set these colors by

00:08:36.246 --> 00:08:37.666 A:middle
modifying properties on

00:08:37.706 --> 00:08:39.176 A:middle
SFSafariViewController.

00:08:40.116 --> 00:08:41.785 A:middle
To set the color of bars

00:08:41.836 --> 00:08:43.436 A:middle
surrounding web content you can

00:08:43.436 --> 00:08:45.126 A:middle
use preferredBarTintColor.

00:08:45.896 --> 00:08:47.066 A:middle
And to set the color of the

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:49.496 A:middle
controls shown here, you can use

00:08:49.536 --> 00:08:51.136 A:middle
preferredControlTintColor.

00:08:51.136 --> 00:08:54.296 A:middle
Now let me tell you about an

00:08:54.296 --> 00:08:55.046 A:middle
improvement to

00:08:55.046 --> 00:08:57.396 A:middle
preferredBarTintColor on iOS 11.

00:08:58.186 --> 00:08:59.106 A:middle
This is my app.

00:08:59.106 --> 00:09:00.406 A:middle
I'm using my favorite shade of

00:08:59.106 --> 00:09:00.406 A:middle
I'm using my favorite shade of

00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:01.626 A:middle
red for its bar color.

00:09:02.886 --> 00:09:04.126 A:middle
Here's what it would look like

00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:05.606 A:middle
if I set that exact same shade

00:09:05.606 --> 00:09:06.786 A:middle
of red to Safari View

00:09:06.786 --> 00:09:09.866 A:middle
Controller's bar color on iOS

00:09:10.496 --> 00:09:10.606 A:middle
10.

00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:12.206 A:middle
As you can see, they don't quite

00:09:12.206 --> 00:09:13.406 A:middle
match up.

00:09:13.616 --> 00:09:15.756 A:middle
And it doesn't feel exactly like

00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:16.586 A:middle
my app.

00:09:16.586 --> 00:09:18.466 A:middle
It looks great, but it's not as

00:09:18.576 --> 00:09:19.496 A:middle
close as it could be.

00:09:20.316 --> 00:09:22.156 A:middle
Let's take a look on iOS 11.

00:09:23.356 --> 00:09:25.006 A:middle
Now, the bar colors match up.

00:09:25.406 --> 00:09:26.676 A:middle
It's just as if I was setting

00:09:26.676 --> 00:09:28.406 A:middle
the bar color on a standard UI

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:30.436 A:middle
navigation bar or UI toolbar.

00:09:31.056 --> 00:09:32.396 A:middle
So, it looks really great and it

00:09:32.466 --> 00:09:35.826 A:middle
fits well within my app.

00:09:36.616 --> 00:09:38.516 A:middle
Now, I'm delighted to invite my

00:09:38.516 --> 00:09:40.156 A:middle
colleague Louie Livon-Bemel to

00:09:40.156 --> 00:09:41.976 A:middle
the stage to show you just how

00:09:41.976 --> 00:09:43.866 A:middle
easy it is to get Safari View

00:09:43.866 --> 00:09:45.326 A:middle
Controller matching your app's

00:09:45.326 --> 00:09:45.686 A:middle
style.

00:09:46.456 --> 00:09:46.816 A:middle
Thank you.

00:09:47.516 --> 00:09:52.836 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:09:53.336 --> 00:09:54.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Chelsea.

00:09:55.316 --> 00:09:57.356 A:middle
Hi, I'm Louie, I'm an engineer

00:09:57.356 --> 00:09:58.986 A:middle
on the Safari team, and I'm

00:09:58.986 --> 00:10:00.576 A:middle
really excited to show you just

00:09:58.986 --> 00:10:00.576 A:middle
really excited to show you just

00:10:00.576 --> 00:10:02.256 A:middle
how easy it is to customize

00:10:02.256 --> 00:10:03.946 A:middle
Safari View Controller to match

00:10:03.946 --> 00:10:07.606 A:middle
your app style.

00:10:09.796 --> 00:10:10.756 A:middle
I'm working on an all new

00:10:10.756 --> 00:10:12.806 A:middle
version of my app, Pizza Finder.

00:10:13.596 --> 00:10:15.496 A:middle
It's the best app for finding

00:10:15.496 --> 00:10:17.016 A:middle
great pizza near you when you're

00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:18.486 A:middle
working on or even watching a

00:10:18.486 --> 00:10:18.866 A:middle
demo.

00:10:20.526 --> 00:10:22.816 A:middle
Like many of your apps, this app

00:10:22.816 --> 00:10:24.626 A:middle
uses a standard UI Navigation

00:10:24.626 --> 00:10:25.196 A:middle
Controller.

00:10:25.636 --> 00:10:27.176 A:middle
I've got a list of pizza places

00:10:27.176 --> 00:10:29.396 A:middle
here, and when I tap one, a new

00:10:29.396 --> 00:10:31.216 A:middle
view comes in from right to left

00:10:31.216 --> 00:10:32.366 A:middle
with more details.

00:10:33.446 --> 00:10:34.986 A:middle
The default presentation of

00:10:34.986 --> 00:10:37.136 A:middle
Safari View Controller is a lot

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:37.806 A:middle
like this.

00:10:38.326 --> 00:10:39.476 A:middle
When I tap on the website,

00:10:40.216 --> 00:10:41.826 A:middle
Safari View Controller came in

00:10:41.926 --> 00:10:44.936 A:middle
from right to left just like a

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.166 A:middle
UI Navigation Controller.

00:10:46.936 --> 00:10:48.486 A:middle
Users can even interactively

00:10:48.486 --> 00:10:49.566 A:middle
edge swipe back when they're

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:50.206 A:middle
done browsing.

00:10:51.866 --> 00:10:52.656 A:middle
So, this is great.

00:10:52.746 --> 00:10:56.116 A:middle
I have a very standard UI here

00:10:56.416 --> 00:10:57.646 A:middle
that my users are used to from

00:10:57.646 --> 00:10:59.706 A:middle
Safari and any other app that's

00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:01.036 A:middle
using Safari View Controller on

00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:01.036 A:middle
using Safari View Controller on

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:01.606 A:middle
the system.

00:11:03.646 --> 00:11:05.326 A:middle
Users even get really advanced

00:11:05.326 --> 00:11:07.436 A:middle
features like in the Share Sheet

00:11:07.436 --> 00:11:08.536 A:middle
all the activities they're used

00:11:08.536 --> 00:11:10.476 A:middle
to from Safari and the powerful

00:11:10.476 --> 00:11:11.846 A:middle
third-party extensions that

00:11:11.846 --> 00:11:12.696 A:middle
they're used to using.

00:11:14.016 --> 00:11:15.276 A:middle
However, this isn't perfect.

00:11:16.156 --> 00:11:17.246 A:middle
It sort of feels like you're

00:11:17.246 --> 00:11:18.246 A:middle
somewhere else.

00:11:18.566 --> 00:11:20.236 A:middle
You might be in another app or

00:11:20.416 --> 00:11:21.696 A:middle
somewhere else on the system or

00:11:21.696 --> 00:11:23.486 A:middle
somewhere else in my app, it

00:11:23.486 --> 00:11:25.156 A:middle
doesn't, it's not clear that

00:11:25.156 --> 00:11:26.126 A:middle
you're still within Pizza

00:11:26.126 --> 00:11:26.596 A:middle
Finder.

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:28.256 A:middle
So, I want to show you how to

00:11:28.256 --> 00:11:29.036 A:middle
improve this.

00:11:29.536 --> 00:11:32.286 A:middle
Here's where I'm presenting

00:11:32.286 --> 00:11:33.516 A:middle
Safari View Controller in my

00:11:33.516 --> 00:11:33.776 A:middle
app.

00:11:33.946 --> 00:11:34.956 A:middle
It's really simple.

00:11:35.116 --> 00:11:36.356 A:middle
All you need to do to adopt

00:11:36.356 --> 00:11:38.036 A:middle
Safari View Controller is do two

00:11:38.036 --> 00:11:38.576 A:middle
things.

00:11:39.096 --> 00:11:40.356 A:middle
The first one, is create a

00:11:40.356 --> 00:11:42.596 A:middle
Safari View Controller using the

00:11:42.596 --> 00:11:44.176 A:middle
URL that you want to lead to.

00:11:46.006 --> 00:11:47.356 A:middle
The second thing you need to do

00:11:47.466 --> 00:11:48.166 A:middle
is present it.

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:49.616 A:middle
And that's it, that's how you

00:11:49.616 --> 00:11:50.806 A:middle
adapt Safari View Controller.

00:11:51.676 --> 00:11:53.356 A:middle
But let's make a few changes.

00:11:53.986 --> 00:11:57.886 A:middle
So, I've done two different

00:11:57.886 --> 00:11:58.316 A:middle
things here.

00:11:58.906 --> 00:12:00.516 A:middle
The first one is setting the

00:11:58.906 --> 00:12:00.516 A:middle
The first one is setting the

00:12:00.516 --> 00:12:02.476 A:middle
preferredBarTintColor to the

00:12:02.476 --> 00:12:03.606 A:middle
same bar color I'm using

00:12:03.606 --> 00:12:04.406 A:middle
elsewhere in my app.

00:12:04.946 --> 00:12:06.196 A:middle
In this case it's that orangish

00:12:06.196 --> 00:12:06.766 A:middle
red color.

00:12:08.096 --> 00:12:09.666 A:middle
Second thing I'm doing is

00:12:09.666 --> 00:12:09.986 A:middle
setting the

00:12:09.986 --> 00:12:11.846 A:middle
preferredControlTintColor to the

00:12:11.846 --> 00:12:13.376 A:middle
same control color I'm using

00:12:13.376 --> 00:12:14.896 A:middle
elsewhere in my app, in this

00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:15.676 A:middle
case that's white.

00:12:17.026 --> 00:12:18.136 A:middle
So, I'll rebuild and I'll show

00:12:18.136 --> 00:12:19.556 A:middle
you how these changes affect

00:12:19.556 --> 00:12:20.216 A:middle
Pizza Finder.

00:12:26.286 --> 00:12:27.196 A:middle
Now when I look at a pizza

00:12:27.196 --> 00:12:29.136 A:middle
place, and go to their website,

00:12:30.006 --> 00:12:31.446 A:middle
Safari View Controller matches

00:12:31.446 --> 00:12:33.016 A:middle
my app's branding and it's

00:12:33.016 --> 00:12:34.326 A:middle
really obvious that I'm still

00:12:34.326 --> 00:12:35.456 A:middle
within Pizza Finder.

00:12:35.576 --> 00:12:36.366 A:middle
It doesn't feel like I'm

00:12:36.366 --> 00:12:37.166 A:middle
somewhere else.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:39.646 A:middle
That's just how easy it is to

00:12:39.646 --> 00:12:41.256 A:middle
customize Safari View Controller

00:12:41.506 --> 00:12:42.996 A:middle
to match your app style and get

00:12:42.996 --> 00:12:44.086 A:middle
your app's branding.

00:12:44.446 --> 00:12:45.716 A:middle
Thank you so much, and I'll now

00:12:45.716 --> 00:12:46.746 A:middle
hand it back over to Chelsea.

00:12:48.516 --> 00:12:53.056 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:53.556 --> 00:12:54.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Louie.

00:12:55.396 --> 00:12:57.186 A:middle
Louie just showed you how easy

00:12:57.186 --> 00:12:59.346 A:middle
it is to get his app's branding

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:00.666 A:middle
in Safari View Controller.

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:00.666 A:middle
in Safari View Controller.

00:13:01.236 --> 00:13:02.406 A:middle
With just a couple lines of

00:13:02.406 --> 00:13:03.716 A:middle
code, he had Safari View

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:05.096 A:middle
Controller up and running with

00:13:05.096 --> 00:13:06.446 A:middle
his app's color scheme.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.896 A:middle
We can't wait to see how good

00:13:09.976 --> 00:13:11.436 A:middle
Safari View Controller's color

00:13:11.436 --> 00:13:14.866 A:middle
schemes look on your app.

00:13:15.136 --> 00:13:17.126 A:middle
Now, I'd like to talk to you

00:13:17.476 --> 00:13:18.646 A:middle
about some improvements that

00:13:18.646 --> 00:13:19.746 A:middle
we've made to Safari View

00:13:19.746 --> 00:13:21.476 A:middle
Controller on iOS 11.

00:13:22.376 --> 00:13:24.166 A:middle
There are five key improvements

00:13:24.216 --> 00:13:25.446 A:middle
that I'm going to talk about.

00:13:27.566 --> 00:13:29.326 A:middle
You may have heard about the new

00:13:29.396 --> 00:13:31.216 A:middle
feature on iOS 11, Drag and

00:13:31.216 --> 00:13:31.486 A:middle
Drop.

00:13:32.316 --> 00:13:34.006 A:middle
I'm excited to let you know that

00:13:34.006 --> 00:13:36.096 A:middle
on iOS 11, Safari View

00:13:36.096 --> 00:13:37.856 A:middle
Controller has Drag and Drop out

00:13:37.856 --> 00:13:38.446 A:middle
of the box.

00:13:38.856 --> 00:13:40.926 A:middle
Users can easily drag URLs out

00:13:40.926 --> 00:13:42.606 A:middle
of Safari View Controller into

00:13:43.646 --> 00:13:45.276 A:middle
other apps.

00:13:45.516 --> 00:13:46.686 A:middle
Now I'd like to talk to you

00:13:46.686 --> 00:13:48.586 A:middle
about some improvements to how

00:13:48.586 --> 00:13:50.316 A:middle
Status Bar styling works in

00:13:50.316 --> 00:13:51.486 A:middle
Safari View Controller.

00:13:54.036 --> 00:13:55.346 A:middle
When presenting Safari View

00:13:55.346 --> 00:13:56.796 A:middle
Controller in some apps, the

00:13:56.796 --> 00:13:58.486 A:middle
Status Bar can become difficult

00:13:58.486 --> 00:13:58.876 A:middle
to read.

00:14:00.436 --> 00:14:01.976 A:middle
It's hard to even notice here,

00:14:02.026 --> 00:14:03.966 A:middle
but I have a dark purple bar,

00:14:03.966 --> 00:14:05.846 A:middle
with a black Status Bar text on

00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:07.516 A:middle
top, and it's illegible.

00:14:09.396 --> 00:14:11.296 A:middle
Ideally, you'd want white Status

00:14:11.296 --> 00:14:13.386 A:middle
Bar text so that the user can

00:14:13.386 --> 00:14:15.956 A:middle
easily read the Status Bar, but

00:14:16.256 --> 00:14:17.946 A:middle
if you just hard code a specific

00:14:18.006 --> 00:14:19.746 A:middle
Status Bar style, you're not

00:14:19.996 --> 00:14:21.446 A:middle
fully fixing the problem.

00:14:21.506 --> 00:14:25.176 A:middle
Other views can be presented in

00:14:25.176 --> 00:14:27.156 A:middle
Safari View Controller such as

00:14:27.156 --> 00:14:29.256 A:middle
the Messages extension, or a

00:14:29.316 --> 00:14:30.276 A:middle
full-screen video.

00:14:31.286 --> 00:14:32.806 A:middle
Here the user is sharing to

00:14:32.806 --> 00:14:35.466 A:middle
Messages so the white Status Bar

00:14:35.466 --> 00:14:37.546 A:middle
style that's been hard coded is

00:14:37.546 --> 00:14:39.156 A:middle
illegible over the white bar of

00:14:39.156 --> 00:14:40.196 A:middle
the Messages view.

00:14:40.796 --> 00:14:44.716 A:middle
The bottom line is that other

00:14:44.716 --> 00:14:46.676 A:middle
views can be presented in Safari

00:14:46.676 --> 00:14:47.396 A:middle
View Controller.

00:14:48.946 --> 00:14:50.106 A:middle
Safari View Controller has

00:14:50.106 --> 00:14:52.006 A:middle
improvements to better adapt the

00:14:52.086 --> 00:14:53.866 A:middle
Status Bar style when other

00:14:53.866 --> 00:14:56.036 A:middle
views are presented on iOS 11.

00:14:57.066 --> 00:14:58.806 A:middle
In order to allow this to work,

00:14:59.056 --> 00:14:59.846 A:middle
you'll want to use

00:14:59.846 --> 00:15:01.436 A:middle
UIViewController-based Status

00:14:59.846 --> 00:15:01.436 A:middle
UIViewController-based Status

00:15:01.506 --> 00:15:02.156 A:middle
Bar appearance.

00:15:02.996 --> 00:15:04.306 A:middle
This has been the recommendation

00:15:04.306 --> 00:15:06.576 A:middle
for all apps since iOS 7.

00:15:07.536 --> 00:15:08.796 A:middle
To do this, you can set

00:15:08.796 --> 00:15:10.256 A:middle
UIViewControllerBased

00:15:10.256 --> 00:15:12.106 A:middle
StatusBarAppearance to yes in

00:15:12.106 --> 00:15:13.356 A:middle
your app's Info.plist.

00:15:14.636 --> 00:15:16.086 A:middle
This will ensure that the Status

00:15:16.116 --> 00:15:17.766 A:middle
Bar remains legible even when

00:15:17.766 --> 00:15:19.286 A:middle
other views are presented in

00:15:19.286 --> 00:15:20.326 A:middle
Safari View Controller.

00:15:20.326 --> 00:15:24.156 A:middle
Now I'd like to tell you about

00:15:24.156 --> 00:15:26.106 A:middle
another improvement, but it

00:15:26.106 --> 00:15:27.616 A:middle
requires a bit of background.

00:15:28.106 --> 00:15:30.046 A:middle
So, I'd like to explain a

00:15:30.106 --> 00:15:31.736 A:middle
scenario in Safari to start.

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:34.626 A:middle
A common experience on the web

00:15:34.876 --> 00:15:36.276 A:middle
is checkout with a third-party

00:15:36.276 --> 00:15:36.726 A:middle
service.

00:15:37.526 --> 00:15:39.186 A:middle
Here I have a page that's asking

00:15:39.186 --> 00:15:40.836 A:middle
me to checkout using Example

00:15:40.836 --> 00:15:41.336 A:middle
Checkout.

00:15:41.846 --> 00:15:45.986 A:middle
When I tap buy now in Safari, a

00:15:45.986 --> 00:15:48.256 A:middle
new tab is opened and I'm able

00:15:48.326 --> 00:15:49.516 A:middle
to complete my payment.

00:15:51.246 --> 00:15:53.626 A:middle
When I tap Buy Now on Example

00:15:53.626 --> 00:15:56.316 A:middle
Checkout, I -- and complete my

00:15:56.396 --> 00:15:59.526 A:middle
payment, the tab that was opened

00:15:59.526 --> 00:16:01.006 A:middle
is closed and I'm back on the

00:15:59.526 --> 00:16:01.006 A:middle
is closed and I'm back on the

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:02.466 A:middle
store site that I was on.

00:16:02.976 --> 00:16:04.066 A:middle
And the store knows that I've

00:16:04.066 --> 00:16:05.556 A:middle
completed my payment.

00:16:06.536 --> 00:16:07.646 A:middle
This is an example of what

00:16:07.646 --> 00:16:09.326 A:middle
happens when a webpage calls

00:16:09.326 --> 00:16:11.466 A:middle
window.open and subsequently

00:16:11.466 --> 00:16:12.736 A:middle
calls window.close.

00:16:13.716 --> 00:16:15.246 A:middle
It previously wasn't supported

00:16:15.246 --> 00:16:16.446 A:middle
in Safari View Controller

00:16:16.446 --> 00:16:17.666 A:middle
because Safari View Controller

00:16:17.666 --> 00:16:18.656 A:middle
doesn't have tabs.

00:16:19.436 --> 00:16:21.476 A:middle
But on iOS 11 Safari View

00:16:21.476 --> 00:16:23.346 A:middle
Controller supports window.open.

00:16:23.776 --> 00:16:27.056 A:middle
[applause] It's pretty great,

00:16:28.846 --> 00:16:29.266 A:middle
yeah.

00:16:29.516 --> 00:16:31.706 A:middle
The way that this now works is

00:16:32.156 --> 00:16:34.406 A:middle
in Safari View Controller when I

00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:37.306 A:middle
tap Buy Now a new, I've

00:16:37.306 --> 00:16:39.076 A:middle
navigated forward instead of

00:16:39.076 --> 00:16:39.856 A:middle
opening a new tab.

00:16:41.186 --> 00:16:42.966 A:middle
Once I've completed my payment

00:16:43.096 --> 00:16:45.216 A:middle
after tapping Buy Now, I'm

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:47.666 A:middle
navigated back to the page, the

00:16:47.666 --> 00:16:50.236 A:middle
domain I was on and the page

00:16:50.236 --> 00:16:51.626 A:middle
knows that I've completed my

00:16:51.626 --> 00:16:52.166 A:middle
payment.

00:16:53.046 --> 00:16:54.326 A:middle
So, I get a confirmation in

00:16:54.326 --> 00:16:55.486 A:middle
Safari View Controller.

00:16:56.586 --> 00:16:58.346 A:middle
This is new to iOS 11.

00:17:00.576 --> 00:17:02.126 A:middle
Now I'd like to talk about some

00:17:02.126 --> 00:17:05.026 A:middle
privacy improvements on iOS 11

00:17:05.445 --> 00:17:06.606 A:middle
in Safari View Controller.

00:17:09.386 --> 00:17:11.126 A:middle
Browsing the web in your app is

00:17:11.126 --> 00:17:12.276 A:middle
different than browsing the web

00:17:12.276 --> 00:17:13.066 A:middle
in other apps.

00:17:13.935 --> 00:17:15.116 A:middle
It's different than browsing the

00:17:15.116 --> 00:17:16.246 A:middle
web in Safari.

00:17:17.026 --> 00:17:19.576 A:middle
I sometimes want to use

00:17:19.646 --> 00:17:20.996 A:middle
different accounts when browsing

00:17:20.996 --> 00:17:21.935 A:middle
the web in different apps.

00:17:22.896 --> 00:17:24.465 A:middle
For some apps, I'll use my work

00:17:24.465 --> 00:17:25.786 A:middle
account and for other apps I'll

00:17:25.786 --> 00:17:27.026 A:middle
use my personal account.

00:17:28.205 --> 00:17:30.456 A:middle
On iOS 11, Safari View

00:17:30.456 --> 00:17:31.786 A:middle
Controller will have a separate

00:17:31.786 --> 00:17:34.156 A:middle
persistent data store in each

00:17:34.476 --> 00:17:35.596 A:middle
app that it's used in.

00:17:36.326 --> 00:17:38.176 A:middle
This means that cookies, local

00:17:38.246 --> 00:17:39.816 A:middle
storage, and other browsing data

00:17:40.346 --> 00:17:41.726 A:middle
will be contained within your

00:17:42.046 --> 00:17:43.486 A:middle
app and scoped to your app.

00:17:44.816 --> 00:17:46.966 A:middle
And this means that the user

00:17:46.966 --> 00:17:48.526 A:middle
won't automatically be logged in

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:49.856 A:middle
to whatever accounts they were

00:17:49.856 --> 00:17:51.326 A:middle
logged into in Safari.

00:17:52.006 --> 00:17:54.476 A:middle
What this does is it will

00:17:54.476 --> 00:17:56.456 A:middle
prevent cross-app tracking of

00:17:56.456 --> 00:17:58.496 A:middle
user's browsing activity that

00:17:58.496 --> 00:18:00.216 A:middle
you and your users may not have

00:17:58.496 --> 00:18:00.216 A:middle
you and your users may not have

00:18:00.216 --> 00:18:01.326 A:middle
even been aware about.

00:18:02.006 --> 00:18:04.006 A:middle
And ultimately, it helps keep

00:18:04.006 --> 00:18:06.036 A:middle
users' browsing activity private

00:18:06.306 --> 00:18:08.626 A:middle
and scoped within your app.

00:18:09.846 --> 00:18:11.456 A:middle
Now I'd like to talk about a

00:18:11.456 --> 00:18:13.086 A:middle
change to Private Browsing in

00:18:13.086 --> 00:18:14.266 A:middle
Safari View Controller.

00:18:15.456 --> 00:18:16.826 A:middle
Now that Safari View Controller

00:18:16.826 --> 00:18:19.126 A:middle
has its own separate persistent

00:18:19.126 --> 00:18:21.426 A:middle
data store for each app, it's

00:18:21.426 --> 00:18:23.026 A:middle
browsing mode is no longer tied

00:18:23.026 --> 00:18:25.496 A:middle
to Safari's this means that I

00:18:25.496 --> 00:18:27.206 A:middle
now longer get the following

00:18:27.346 --> 00:18:28.606 A:middle
frustrating experience.

00:18:29.816 --> 00:18:31.576 A:middle
I'm browsing the web in Safari

00:18:31.656 --> 00:18:33.946 A:middle
in Private Mode.

00:18:34.156 --> 00:18:37.236 A:middle
Time passes and later that day

00:18:37.576 --> 00:18:38.866 A:middle
after I've forgotten that I was

00:18:38.866 --> 00:18:41.116 A:middle
even in Private Mode, I go to my

00:18:41.116 --> 00:18:42.886 A:middle
favorite app that opens links

00:18:42.886 --> 00:18:44.296 A:middle
using Safari View Controller.

00:18:45.686 --> 00:18:46.846 A:middle
Safari View Controller is

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:49.176 A:middle
presented in Private Mode once I

00:18:49.176 --> 00:18:51.306 A:middle
open a link and that's confusing

00:18:51.306 --> 00:18:52.306 A:middle
to me because I didn't

00:18:52.306 --> 00:18:54.116 A:middle
intentionally tell it to open in

00:18:54.116 --> 00:18:55.116 A:middle
Private Browsing Mode.

00:18:56.286 --> 00:18:58.136 A:middle
So, on iOS 11 now that Safari

00:18:58.136 --> 00:18:59.796 A:middle
View Controller has its own

00:19:00.546 --> 00:19:02.496 A:middle
browsing mode, it's no longer

00:19:02.636 --> 00:19:03.726 A:middle
tied to Safari's.

00:19:04.856 --> 00:19:06.556 A:middle
That means that your apps' color

00:19:06.556 --> 00:19:08.446 A:middle
scheme will be used more often.

00:19:08.446 --> 00:19:14.016 A:middle
Now I'd like to tell you about

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:15.786 A:middle
three new APIs that we've added

00:19:16.236 --> 00:19:17.916 A:middle
so you can really tailor Safari

00:19:17.916 --> 00:19:19.726 A:middle
View Controller to fit your

00:19:20.036 --> 00:19:20.916 A:middle
app's experience.

00:19:22.956 --> 00:19:24.556 A:middle
First I'd like to talk to about

00:19:24.556 --> 00:19:25.926 A:middle
how you can now customize the

00:19:25.926 --> 00:19:27.556 A:middle
Dismiss button of Safari View

00:19:27.556 --> 00:19:28.146 A:middle
Controller.

00:19:28.636 --> 00:19:31.826 A:middle
Language is very important when

00:19:31.826 --> 00:19:33.436 A:middle
conveying intent to the user.

00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:36.176 A:middle
The standard Dismiss button

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:38.176 A:middle
style for Safari View Controller

00:19:38.246 --> 00:19:38.786 A:middle
is Done.

00:19:39.656 --> 00:19:40.906 A:middle
This works really well for a

00:19:41.006 --> 00:19:42.406 A:middle
standard browsing case, because

00:19:42.406 --> 00:19:43.536 A:middle
the user can browse through a

00:19:43.536 --> 00:19:45.006 A:middle
bunch of different web pages and

00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:46.216 A:middle
then when they're finished

00:19:46.216 --> 00:19:48.166 A:middle
browsing tap Done to indicate

00:19:48.166 --> 00:19:48.876 A:middle
that they've ended their

00:19:48.876 --> 00:19:49.796 A:middle
browsing session.

00:19:51.866 --> 00:19:53.896 A:middle
On iOS 11 we've added two new

00:19:53.896 --> 00:19:55.606 A:middle
options that this Dismiss button

00:19:55.606 --> 00:19:56.386 A:middle
can take on.

00:19:57.286 --> 00:19:58.856 A:middle
The first of those options is

00:19:58.856 --> 00:19:59.416 A:middle
Cancel.

00:20:00.426 --> 00:20:01.926 A:middle
I think Cancel makes a lot of

00:20:01.986 --> 00:20:03.316 A:middle
sense when I'm getting my user's

00:20:03.316 --> 00:20:04.946 A:middle
authenticated to a third-party

00:20:04.946 --> 00:20:05.396 A:middle
service.

00:20:06.386 --> 00:20:07.866 A:middle
The user will know that if they

00:20:07.866 --> 00:20:09.516 A:middle
tap that button, they're not

00:20:09.516 --> 00:20:10.726 A:middle
really authenticating with my

00:20:10.806 --> 00:20:12.336 A:middle
service, they're cancelling the

00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:13.126 A:middle
transaction.

00:20:14.306 --> 00:20:16.336 A:middle
The other new style is Close.

00:20:17.286 --> 00:20:18.356 A:middle
This makes sense if I'm

00:20:18.356 --> 00:20:19.776 A:middle
presenting some transient web

00:20:19.776 --> 00:20:21.646 A:middle
content to the user, perhaps a

00:20:21.646 --> 00:20:23.096 A:middle
Terms of Service page.

00:20:24.336 --> 00:20:25.436 A:middle
I'm giving them a page where

00:20:25.436 --> 00:20:26.486 A:middle
they're probably not likely to

00:20:26.486 --> 00:20:28.316 A:middle
follow other links, so they'll

00:20:28.316 --> 00:20:30.326 A:middle
just Close once they've finished

00:20:30.326 --> 00:20:34.936 A:middle
reading what I've presented to

00:20:35.146 --> 00:20:35.386 A:middle
them.

00:20:35.426 --> 00:20:36.306 A:middle
Now I'd like, or the Dismiss

00:20:36.306 --> 00:20:39.026 A:middle
button style is a property on

00:20:39.226 --> 00:20:40.466 A:middle
SFSafariViewController.

00:20:40.466 --> 00:20:42.966 A:middle
As I mentioned it has these two

00:20:42.966 --> 00:20:43.696 A:middle
new options.

00:20:44.106 --> 00:20:45.586 A:middle
The default style will be Done

00:20:45.896 --> 00:20:46.946 A:middle
but you can choose which ever

00:20:46.946 --> 00:20:48.886 A:middle
style best fits your use case of

00:20:48.886 --> 00:20:50.006 A:middle
Safari View Controller.

00:20:51.546 --> 00:20:52.936 A:middle
The value can even be changed

00:20:52.936 --> 00:20:54.266 A:middle
while Safari View Controller is

00:20:54.266 --> 00:20:55.726 A:middle
presented, which Louie will

00:20:55.726 --> 00:20:56.666 A:middle
demonstrate later.

00:20:56.666 --> 00:21:00.666 A:middle
Now I'd like to talk to you

00:20:56.666 --> 00:21:00.666 A:middle
Now I'd like to talk to you

00:21:00.666 --> 00:21:02.136 A:middle
about a customization you can

00:21:02.136 --> 00:21:03.866 A:middle
make to the Share Sheet in

00:21:03.866 --> 00:21:04.976 A:middle
Safari View Controller.

00:21:07.596 --> 00:21:09.536 A:middle
Let's say I'm presenting a login

00:21:09.566 --> 00:21:10.426 A:middle
flow to the user.

00:21:11.566 --> 00:21:12.946 A:middle
When the tap the share button

00:21:12.946 --> 00:21:13.886 A:middle
they have all these different

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:15.816 A:middle
actions that they can take, but

00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:16.836 A:middle
some of them don't really make

00:21:16.836 --> 00:21:17.806 A:middle
sense in this case.

00:21:18.646 --> 00:21:19.736 A:middle
They're probably not going to

00:21:19.836 --> 00:21:21.196 A:middle
send the page somewhere else

00:21:21.516 --> 00:21:22.626 A:middle
because it might disrupt the

00:21:22.626 --> 00:21:24.646 A:middle
login flow and the login might

00:21:24.646 --> 00:21:25.726 A:middle
now even work outside of the

00:21:25.726 --> 00:21:26.566 A:middle
context of my app.

00:21:29.006 --> 00:21:31.676 A:middle
Here, I've filtered out, so this

00:21:31.676 --> 00:21:33.786 A:middle
is what the actions that I don't

00:21:33.786 --> 00:21:34.276 A:middle
want to show.

00:21:35.056 --> 00:21:36.796 A:middle
On iOS 11 we're giving the

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.566 A:middle
ability to filter out some of

00:21:38.566 --> 00:21:40.106 A:middle
these UIActivityTypes.

00:21:41.266 --> 00:21:43.896 A:middle
Here, I've filtered out AirDrop,

00:21:44.066 --> 00:21:46.456 A:middle
Mail, and Messages because my

00:21:46.456 --> 00:21:47.926 A:middle
users don't need them in this

00:21:47.926 --> 00:21:48.256 A:middle
case.

00:21:50.346 --> 00:21:52.346 A:middle
You make recognize this API on

00:21:52.346 --> 00:21:53.916 A:middle
UIActivityViewController.

00:21:54.496 --> 00:21:56.816 A:middle
It allows you to set an array of

00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:58.636 A:middle
UIActivityTypes that the user

00:21:58.636 --> 00:22:00.446 A:middle
doesn't need on your

00:21:58.636 --> 00:22:00.446 A:middle
doesn't need on your

00:22:00.446 --> 00:22:01.956 A:middle
UIActivityViewController.

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:03.626 A:middle
We realize that if you're

00:22:03.626 --> 00:22:05.026 A:middle
implementing your own in-app web

00:22:05.026 --> 00:22:06.636 A:middle
browsing experience, you'd have

00:22:06.636 --> 00:22:08.056 A:middle
the ability to customize the

00:22:08.056 --> 00:22:09.266 A:middle
Share Sheet in this way.

00:22:10.316 --> 00:22:12.076 A:middle
So, in iOS 11 we're exposing

00:22:12.076 --> 00:22:13.546 A:middle
this same ability on

00:22:13.726 --> 00:22:16.576 A:middle
SFSafariViewControllerDelegate

00:22:17.046 --> 00:22:18.846 A:middle
as a method where you can return

00:22:18.846 --> 00:22:21.426 A:middle
an array of UIActivityTypes that

00:22:21.426 --> 00:22:22.846 A:middle
you don't want to be presented

00:22:22.846 --> 00:22:24.806 A:middle
to the user in the context of

00:22:24.806 --> 00:22:26.146 A:middle
your Safari View Controller.

00:22:28.376 --> 00:22:29.806 A:middle
Now, I'd like to talk about Bar

00:22:29.806 --> 00:22:31.366 A:middle
Collapsing in Safari View

00:22:31.366 --> 00:22:31.916 A:middle
Controller.

00:22:33.496 --> 00:22:36.756 A:middle
Safari View Controller's bars

00:22:36.816 --> 00:22:38.426 A:middle
collapse away while in browsing,

00:22:38.886 --> 00:22:39.906 A:middle
which lets me really get

00:22:39.906 --> 00:22:41.356 A:middle
immersed in my browsing

00:22:41.356 --> 00:22:42.086 A:middle
experience.

00:22:43.546 --> 00:22:45.686 A:middle
However, in some cases this bar

00:22:45.686 --> 00:22:46.906 A:middle
collapsing behavior can be

00:22:46.906 --> 00:22:47.586 A:middle
frustrating.

00:22:48.276 --> 00:22:49.836 A:middle
Let's say I have a login flow.

00:22:50.486 --> 00:22:52.316 A:middle
If bars are collapsed, the

00:22:52.316 --> 00:22:54.066 A:middle
Dismiss button gets hidden.

00:22:54.306 --> 00:22:55.676 A:middle
So, it's a bit more difficult to

00:22:55.676 --> 00:22:57.276 A:middle
Dismiss Safari View Controller.

00:22:58.656 --> 00:22:59.766 A:middle
So, in something quick like a

00:22:59.766 --> 00:23:02.806 A:middle
login flow, this standard bar

00:22:59.766 --> 00:23:02.806 A:middle
login flow, this standard bar

00:23:02.806 --> 00:23:04.656 A:middle
collapsing behavior might not

00:23:04.656 --> 00:23:06.636 A:middle
necessarily make sense.

00:23:07.046 --> 00:23:10.276 A:middle
On iOS 11, we're allowing you to

00:23:10.276 --> 00:23:11.476 A:middle
disable this standard bar

00:23:11.476 --> 00:23:12.976 A:middle
collapsing behavior if it best

00:23:13.066 --> 00:23:13.976 A:middle
fits your use case.

00:23:15.436 --> 00:23:17.366 A:middle
This will be a new property on

00:23:17.366 --> 00:23:18.746 A:middle
SFSafariViewController

00:23:18.746 --> 00:23:20.666 A:middle
.Configuration which will be

00:23:20.666 --> 00:23:22.196 A:middle
passed into Safari View

00:23:22.196 --> 00:23:23.656 A:middle
Controller's initializer.

00:23:24.256 --> 00:23:27.246 A:middle
It's best to leave this enabled

00:23:27.596 --> 00:23:29.466 A:middle
if your use case is show user's

00:23:29.506 --> 00:23:31.986 A:middle
browsing, or user's content that

00:23:31.986 --> 00:23:33.206 A:middle
they should really get immersed

00:23:33.286 --> 00:23:33.456 A:middle
in.

00:23:34.236 --> 00:23:35.686 A:middle
But, if it's important to always

00:23:35.686 --> 00:23:37.246 A:middle
have the Dismiss button shown,

00:23:38.076 --> 00:23:39.486 A:middle
you can disable this property.

00:23:39.486 --> 00:23:44.036 A:middle
Now, I'd like to welcome Louie

00:23:44.036 --> 00:23:45.476 A:middle
back to the stage to show you

00:23:45.476 --> 00:23:47.266 A:middle
how easy it is to use these new

00:23:47.266 --> 00:23:49.456 A:middle
APIs to tailor for his app's

00:23:49.456 --> 00:23:50.096 A:middle
experience.

00:23:51.516 --> 00:23:56.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:57.046 --> 00:23:57.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Chelsea.

00:23:58.686 --> 00:24:00.286 A:middle
I'm thrilled to show you how

00:23:58.686 --> 00:24:00.286 A:middle
I'm thrilled to show you how

00:24:00.286 --> 00:24:01.746 A:middle
easy it is to customize Safari

00:24:01.746 --> 00:24:03.286 A:middle
View Controller using these new

00:24:03.286 --> 00:24:05.216 A:middle
APIs and I'm going to give you a

00:24:05.216 --> 00:24:06.806 A:middle
sneak peak at the next app I'm

00:24:06.806 --> 00:24:07.416 A:middle
working on.

00:24:09.056 --> 00:24:11.076 A:middle
It's another pizza related app,

00:24:11.266 --> 00:24:12.936 A:middle
so I hope that's not too cheesy.

00:24:13.456 --> 00:24:16.826 A:middle
[laughter] This is a social app

00:24:16.966 --> 00:24:18.226 A:middle
called Pizza Stories.

00:24:18.846 --> 00:24:20.086 A:middle
It allows you to share all the

00:24:20.086 --> 00:24:21.596 A:middle
pizza related news in your life

00:24:21.596 --> 00:24:23.106 A:middle
in a visual format with your

00:24:23.106 --> 00:24:24.246 A:middle
friends and family.

00:24:26.396 --> 00:24:28.656 A:middle
By default, it when you're not

00:24:28.656 --> 00:24:30.276 A:middle
logged in, you get a list of

00:24:30.276 --> 00:24:31.626 A:middle
pizza brands that are sharing

00:24:31.626 --> 00:24:32.486 A:middle
some stories.

00:24:33.636 --> 00:24:34.956 A:middle
However, to get the best

00:24:34.956 --> 00:24:36.016 A:middle
experience out of this app,

00:24:36.336 --> 00:24:37.256 A:middle
you'll want to log-in.

00:24:38.066 --> 00:24:40.756 A:middle
I don't want users to have to

00:24:40.756 --> 00:24:42.876 A:middle
create and maintain a list of

00:24:42.876 --> 00:24:44.766 A:middle
their friends in my app, and I

00:24:44.766 --> 00:24:46.016 A:middle
don't own a social network that

00:24:46.016 --> 00:24:48.336 A:middle
already has this, so I want them

00:24:48.336 --> 00:24:49.736 A:middle
to be able to use an existing

00:24:49.736 --> 00:24:51.146 A:middle
list that they've already used

00:24:51.426 --> 00:24:53.366 A:middle
and created all of their friends

00:24:54.046 --> 00:24:55.766 A:middle
on an existing social network.

00:24:56.626 --> 00:24:58.196 A:middle
I'm using Safari View Controller

00:24:58.336 --> 00:24:59.436 A:middle
to let them log-in and

00:24:59.436 --> 00:25:00.786 A:middle
authenticate against this social

00:24:59.436 --> 00:25:00.786 A:middle
authenticate against this social

00:25:00.786 --> 00:25:01.176 A:middle
network.

00:25:01.626 --> 00:25:04.646 A:middle
I tap Log In, Safari View

00:25:04.646 --> 00:25:06.206 A:middle
Controller is shown and let's my

00:25:06.206 --> 00:25:08.286 A:middle
users log in with SampleChat a

00:25:08.286 --> 00:25:09.836 A:middle
really popular demo social

00:25:09.836 --> 00:25:10.266 A:middle
network.

00:25:12.176 --> 00:25:13.336 A:middle
You may have noticed that Safari

00:25:13.336 --> 00:25:15.116 A:middle
View Controller came in from

00:25:15.116 --> 00:25:16.226 A:middle
right to left like a

00:25:16.226 --> 00:25:18.066 A:middle
UINavigationController.

00:25:18.696 --> 00:25:19.896 A:middle
My app doesn't use this

00:25:19.896 --> 00:25:21.736 A:middle
paradigm, so that feels a little

00:25:21.736 --> 00:25:22.156 A:middle
weird.

00:25:23.006 --> 00:25:25.706 A:middle
I have already made it so that

00:25:25.706 --> 00:25:27.076 A:middle
Safari View Controller takes on

00:25:27.076 --> 00:25:30.596 A:middle
the colors of my app, but the

00:25:30.596 --> 00:25:32.156 A:middle
transition didn't feel right for

00:25:32.156 --> 00:25:33.106 A:middle
my app.

00:25:33.246 --> 00:25:35.946 A:middle
Similarly, saying Done doesn't

00:25:35.946 --> 00:25:36.896 A:middle
really make sense here.

00:25:37.316 --> 00:25:38.446 A:middle
I want to communicate to my

00:25:38.446 --> 00:25:40.506 A:middle
users that tapping this button

00:25:40.506 --> 00:25:42.246 A:middle
will cancel this login session.

00:25:42.756 --> 00:25:44.596 A:middle
So, it's clear what's going to

00:25:44.686 --> 00:25:45.616 A:middle
happen when they tap it.

00:25:46.266 --> 00:25:48.056 A:middle
And if my users are reading the

00:25:48.056 --> 00:25:49.486 A:middle
Terms of Service and they scroll

00:25:49.486 --> 00:25:51.246 A:middle
down a little bit, the bars

00:25:51.246 --> 00:25:51.856 A:middle
collapse.

00:25:52.186 --> 00:25:53.856 A:middle
This might nice in some other

00:25:53.856 --> 00:25:55.546 A:middle
web pages, but here it could

00:25:55.546 --> 00:25:56.366 A:middle
just get annoying.

00:25:56.786 --> 00:25:58.696 A:middle
If they want to cancel, it's two

00:25:58.696 --> 00:25:59.996 A:middle
taps away instead of one.

00:26:01.276 --> 00:26:02.626 A:middle
So, I'll show you how to improve

00:26:02.626 --> 00:26:04.176 A:middle
Safari View Controller to fit

00:26:04.176 --> 00:26:08.366 A:middle
this log in a little bit better.

00:26:08.566 --> 00:26:09.376 A:middle
Here's where I'm presenting

00:26:09.376 --> 00:26:10.466 A:middle
Safari View Controller.

00:26:11.016 --> 00:26:12.336 A:middle
Like before, it's pretty simple.

00:26:12.856 --> 00:26:15.126 A:middle
I'm creating a URL and then

00:26:15.416 --> 00:26:16.546 A:middle
passing that to Safari View

00:26:16.546 --> 00:26:17.636 A:middle
Controller's initializer.

00:26:18.946 --> 00:26:20.326 A:middle
Customizing the colors as I

00:26:20.326 --> 00:26:21.126 A:middle
showed you before.

00:26:21.706 --> 00:26:23.916 A:middle
And then presenting Safari View

00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:24.366 A:middle
Controller.

00:26:25.196 --> 00:26:27.146 A:middle
But let's make some changes.

00:26:27.306 --> 00:26:28.526 A:middle
First, let's make sure that the

00:26:28.526 --> 00:26:29.726 A:middle
bars don't collapse when they

00:26:29.726 --> 00:26:30.306 A:middle
scroll down.

00:26:34.956 --> 00:26:36.206 A:middle
So, what I've done here is

00:26:36.206 --> 00:26:37.666 A:middle
created a Safari View Controller

00:26:37.666 --> 00:26:39.826 A:middle
configuration object and then

00:26:39.826 --> 00:26:41.416 A:middle
set its barCollapsingEnabled

00:26:41.416 --> 00:26:42.536 A:middle
property to false.

00:26:42.866 --> 00:26:44.136 A:middle
This way when they scroll down

00:26:44.136 --> 00:26:45.266 A:middle
the bars won't collapse, they'll

00:26:45.266 --> 00:26:46.556 A:middle
still stay full height.

00:26:47.566 --> 00:26:49.116 A:middle
I then pass this in to Safari

00:26:49.116 --> 00:26:50.306 A:middle
View Controller's initializer.

00:26:51.796 --> 00:26:52.586 A:middle
Let's make a couple other

00:26:52.586 --> 00:26:53.296 A:middle
changes.

00:26:55.016 --> 00:26:57.056 A:middle
I've done two different things

00:26:57.056 --> 00:26:57.306 A:middle
here.

00:26:57.566 --> 00:26:58.786 A:middle
The first, is setting

00:26:58.786 --> 00:27:01.206 A:middle
dismissButtonStyle to Cancel so

00:26:58.786 --> 00:27:01.206 A:middle
dismissButtonStyle to Cancel so

00:27:01.206 --> 00:27:02.626 A:middle
that the button will say Cancel

00:27:02.626 --> 00:27:03.726 A:middle
instead of Done, which is the

00:27:03.726 --> 00:27:04.216 A:middle
default.

00:27:05.536 --> 00:27:06.646 A:middle
Second change I've made is

00:27:06.646 --> 00:27:07.896 A:middle
slightly more complicated.

00:27:08.346 --> 00:27:09.266 A:middle
I'm overriding the

00:27:09.266 --> 00:27:10.666 A:middle
transitioningDelegate of Safari

00:27:10.666 --> 00:27:12.196 A:middle
View Controller to myself.

00:27:13.146 --> 00:27:14.486 A:middle
Since I haven't implemented any

00:27:14.486 --> 00:27:15.266 A:middle
of the methods of

00:27:15.266 --> 00:27:16.576 A:middle
UITransitioningDelegate, I'm

00:27:16.576 --> 00:27:18.196 A:middle
just going to get the standard

00:27:18.196 --> 00:27:20.346 A:middle
system default behavior where a

00:27:20.346 --> 00:27:21.606 A:middle
view comes in from bottom to

00:27:21.606 --> 00:27:22.036 A:middle
top.

00:27:23.476 --> 00:27:24.456 A:middle
I'll rebuild and show you how

00:27:24.456 --> 00:27:25.816 A:middle
this works in Pizza Stories.

00:27:29.496 --> 00:27:32.286 A:middle
Now when I tap Log In, Safari

00:27:32.286 --> 00:27:33.436 A:middle
View Controller came in from

00:27:33.436 --> 00:27:34.256 A:middle
bottom to top.

00:27:35.136 --> 00:27:36.426 A:middle
Now you may notice here, the

00:27:36.426 --> 00:27:37.216 A:middle
view is blank.

00:27:37.396 --> 00:27:38.726 A:middle
This is a bug on Seed 1.

00:27:38.786 --> 00:27:40.136 A:middle
If you do run into this, I'll

00:27:40.136 --> 00:27:41.026 A:middle
show you how to fix it.

00:27:41.506 --> 00:27:42.296 A:middle
You can either pull down

00:27:42.296 --> 00:27:44.206 A:middle
Notification Center or press the

00:27:44.206 --> 00:27:46.506 A:middle
Home button and then go back in

00:27:46.586 --> 00:27:49.636 A:middle
and the page loads.

00:27:49.636 --> 00:27:51.746 A:middle
So, in addition to the new

00:27:51.746 --> 00:27:54.116 A:middle
presentation, the Dismiss button

00:27:54.116 --> 00:27:55.626 A:middle
says Cancel to better indicate

00:27:55.626 --> 00:27:56.946 A:middle
to my users what tapping this

00:27:56.946 --> 00:27:57.326 A:middle
will do.

00:27:57.886 --> 00:28:00.506 A:middle
And when I scroll down, the bars

00:27:57.886 --> 00:28:00.506 A:middle
And when I scroll down, the bars

00:28:00.506 --> 00:28:01.186 A:middle
don't squish.

00:28:02.366 --> 00:28:03.376 A:middle
So, we're almost there.

00:28:03.856 --> 00:28:04.946 A:middle
However, there's one more change

00:28:04.946 --> 00:28:05.416 A:middle
I want to make.

00:28:07.116 --> 00:28:08.306 A:middle
Right now, it makes sense for

00:28:08.306 --> 00:28:09.466 A:middle
the button to say Cancel.

00:28:10.476 --> 00:28:11.816 A:middle
But, when my users successfully

00:28:11.816 --> 00:28:13.386 A:middle
logged in, it shouldn't say

00:28:13.386 --> 00:28:13.916 A:middle
Cancel.

00:28:13.916 --> 00:28:15.106 A:middle
I want to indicate to them that

00:28:15.106 --> 00:28:16.586 A:middle
it's okay to dismiss after that.

00:28:18.296 --> 00:28:19.616 A:middle
So, as Chelsea mentioned before,

00:28:19.616 --> 00:28:20.556 A:middle
what's really cool about this

00:28:20.556 --> 00:28:21.976 A:middle
property is it can be changed

00:28:21.976 --> 00:28:23.256 A:middle
even after I've already

00:28:23.366 --> 00:28:24.296 A:middle
presented Safari View

00:28:24.296 --> 00:28:24.816 A:middle
Controller.

00:28:26.306 --> 00:28:27.846 A:middle
When my user logs in with

00:28:27.846 --> 00:28:29.866 A:middle
SampleChat, they redirect to a

00:28:29.866 --> 00:28:31.546 A:middle
URL scheme that my app handles.

00:28:32.086 --> 00:28:34.646 A:middle
That gets handled in my

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:36.306 A:middle
AppDelegate in this method.

00:28:37.016 --> 00:28:37.996 A:middle
And what I'm doing here is I'm

00:28:37.996 --> 00:28:39.216 A:middle
making sure that there's a log

00:28:39.216 --> 00:28:40.876 A:middle
in token to indicate that the

00:28:40.876 --> 00:28:42.796 A:middle
user's authenticated, then I'm

00:28:42.796 --> 00:28:44.106 A:middle
sending a message to elsewhere

00:28:44.106 --> 00:28:47.246 A:middle
in my app giving it that token.

00:28:48.286 --> 00:28:49.366 A:middle
I'm handling that here.

00:28:50.286 --> 00:28:51.546 A:middle
And I'm doing that because I

00:28:51.546 --> 00:28:52.556 A:middle
like to keep this code

00:28:52.556 --> 00:28:53.226 A:middle
organized.

00:28:53.226 --> 00:28:54.376 A:middle
I want everything related to

00:28:54.376 --> 00:28:56.256 A:middle
Login in one place rather than

00:28:56.256 --> 00:28:57.206 A:middle
having it in a few different

00:28:57.206 --> 00:28:57.836 A:middle
places.

00:28:59.196 --> 00:29:00.176 A:middle
Now that I know that the user

00:28:59.196 --> 00:29:00.176 A:middle
Now that I know that the user

00:29:00.176 --> 00:29:02.106 A:middle
has successfully logged in, I

00:29:02.936 --> 00:29:04.126 A:middle
can change the

00:29:04.126 --> 00:29:05.796 A:middle
dismissButtonStyle of Safari

00:29:05.796 --> 00:29:07.906 A:middle
View Controller to Done instead

00:29:07.906 --> 00:29:08.536 A:middle
of Cancel.

00:29:10.356 --> 00:29:11.226 A:middle
So, I'll rebuild and I'll show

00:29:11.226 --> 00:29:12.616 A:middle
you how this all comes together

00:29:12.616 --> 00:29:13.526 A:middle
in Pizza Stories.

00:29:24.076 --> 00:29:26.566 A:middle
Now, when I tap Log In, Safari

00:29:26.566 --> 00:29:27.246 A:middle
View Controller is still

00:29:27.246 --> 00:29:28.666 A:middle
presented from bottom to top and

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:29.746 A:middle
the button initially does say

00:29:29.746 --> 00:29:30.216 A:middle
Cancel.

00:29:31.506 --> 00:29:32.896 A:middle
With just a couple taps I can

00:29:32.896 --> 00:29:35.896 A:middle
use AutoFill to log in.

00:29:36.116 --> 00:29:37.716 A:middle
Now, SampleChat is asking the

00:29:37.716 --> 00:29:39.856 A:middle
user if they want to allow this

00:29:39.856 --> 00:29:41.826 A:middle
app, in this case Pizza Stories,

00:29:42.016 --> 00:29:43.626 A:middle
to use their account for their

00:29:43.626 --> 00:29:45.476 A:middle
friends list and their email.

00:29:45.476 --> 00:29:46.956 A:middle
I'll allow that.

00:29:47.996 --> 00:29:49.466 A:middle
And now that I'm logged in, the

00:29:49.466 --> 00:29:51.606 A:middle
Done button, the Dismiss button

00:29:51.606 --> 00:29:53.056 A:middle
has changed to say Done to

00:29:53.056 --> 00:29:54.636 A:middle
better indicate to my users it's

00:29:54.636 --> 00:29:56.426 A:middle
okay to dismiss now.

00:29:57.516 --> 00:30:00.686 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:29:57.516 --> 00:30:00.686 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:01.186 --> 00:30:04.046 A:middle
Thanks. So, when I dismiss, now

00:30:04.046 --> 00:30:05.346 A:middle
I get all of my friends showing

00:30:05.346 --> 00:30:06.996 A:middle
up in my, and I can see all

00:30:06.996 --> 00:30:07.836 A:middle
their stories.

00:30:08.586 --> 00:30:09.596 A:middle
This might make me crave some

00:30:09.596 --> 00:30:10.496 A:middle
pizza later on though.

00:30:11.436 --> 00:30:14.766 A:middle
Thanks, and this is how easy it

00:30:14.766 --> 00:30:16.106 A:middle
is to customize Safari View

00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:17.946 A:middle
Controller using the new APIs in

00:30:18.046 --> 00:30:20.346 A:middle
iOS 11 to tailor it to your app

00:30:20.606 --> 00:30:21.546 A:middle
and make a great log in

00:30:21.546 --> 00:30:22.266 A:middle
experience.

00:30:22.766 --> 00:30:23.876 A:middle
Thank you so much and I'll hand

00:30:23.876 --> 00:30:24.656 A:middle
it back over to Chelsea.

00:30:26.516 --> 00:30:30.266 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:30.766 --> 00:30:31.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Louie.

00:30:32.116 --> 00:30:33.566 A:middle
I think Louie is going to making

00:30:33.566 --> 00:30:35.026 A:middle
a lot of dough off that one.

00:30:37.556 --> 00:30:38.706 A:middle
[laughter] Louie just showed you

00:30:38.816 --> 00:30:40.746 A:middle
how with a few key improvements,

00:30:41.096 --> 00:30:42.726 A:middle
he made, he took his log in flow

00:30:42.726 --> 00:30:43.946 A:middle
with Safari View Controller to

00:30:43.946 --> 00:30:44.786 A:middle
the next level.

00:30:45.636 --> 00:30:47.736 A:middle
He did this by using a custom

00:30:47.736 --> 00:30:50.006 A:middle
presentation style that it felt

00:30:50.006 --> 00:30:51.706 A:middle
more like the presentation style

00:30:51.706 --> 00:30:52.156 A:middle
in his app.

00:30:53.736 --> 00:30:55.286 A:middle
He changed the Dismiss button to

00:30:55.286 --> 00:30:57.256 A:middle
say Cancel so that users know

00:30:57.636 --> 00:30:59.096 A:middle
that if they tap that button

00:30:59.096 --> 00:31:00.566 A:middle
they'll be cancelling log in

00:30:59.096 --> 00:31:00.566 A:middle
they'll be cancelling log in

00:31:00.566 --> 00:31:01.846 A:middle
with the third-party service

00:31:01.846 --> 00:31:03.996 A:middle
he's asking them to log in with.

00:31:05.426 --> 00:31:07.066 A:middle
He turned off bar collapsing.

00:31:07.236 --> 00:31:08.646 A:middle
This way if the user reads the

00:31:08.646 --> 00:31:10.456 A:middle
Terms of Service and decides

00:31:10.456 --> 00:31:11.616 A:middle
that they don't want to use that

00:31:11.616 --> 00:31:13.106 A:middle
service, they can quickly tap

00:31:13.106 --> 00:31:14.716 A:middle
cancel to exit Safari View

00:31:14.716 --> 00:31:15.316 A:middle
Controller.

00:31:15.886 --> 00:31:19.516 A:middle
And he changed the button to say

00:31:19.516 --> 00:31:21.376 A:middle
Done once the user had allowed

00:31:21.376 --> 00:31:22.716 A:middle
access to that third-party

00:31:22.716 --> 00:31:23.106 A:middle
service.

00:31:23.696 --> 00:31:25.176 A:middle
This way they know that they've

00:31:25.236 --> 00:31:26.356 A:middle
finished logging in.

00:31:26.866 --> 00:31:30.726 A:middle
One of the main things that we

00:31:30.726 --> 00:31:31.926 A:middle
want you to get out of this

00:31:31.986 --> 00:31:34.316 A:middle
presentation is that we hear

00:31:34.316 --> 00:31:34.616 A:middle
you.

00:31:35.766 --> 00:31:37.176 A:middle
The new APIs that we've talked

00:31:37.176 --> 00:31:39.356 A:middle
about today were inspired by

00:31:39.486 --> 00:31:40.496 A:middle
feedback from you.

00:31:41.476 --> 00:31:43.096 A:middle
We really encourage you to keep

00:31:43.096 --> 00:31:45.016 A:middle
giving us feature requests and

00:31:45.016 --> 00:31:46.226 A:middle
filing bug reports.

00:31:47.046 --> 00:31:48.506 A:middle
And also letting us know if

00:31:48.546 --> 00:31:49.266 A:middle
there are any other

00:31:49.266 --> 00:31:51.026 A:middle
customizations you'd like to see

00:31:51.136 --> 00:31:52.416 A:middle
in Safari View Controller.

00:31:53.496 --> 00:31:54.636 A:middle
So, keep talking to us.

00:31:57.026 --> 00:32:00.916 A:middle
In summary, Safari View

00:31:57.026 --> 00:32:00.916 A:middle
In summary, Safari View

00:32:00.916 --> 00:32:03.786 A:middle
Controller gives you an easy

00:32:03.786 --> 00:32:05.566 A:middle
in-app web browsing experience.

00:32:05.896 --> 00:32:07.026 A:middle
With just a couple lines of

00:32:07.026 --> 00:32:08.986 A:middle
code, you can get Safari View

00:32:08.986 --> 00:32:10.716 A:middle
Controller up and running in

00:32:10.716 --> 00:32:11.386 A:middle
your app.

00:32:12.876 --> 00:32:14.206 A:middle
Safari View Controller is

00:32:14.346 --> 00:32:15.816 A:middle
perfect for authenticating with

00:32:15.816 --> 00:32:17.966 A:middle
third-party services because it

00:32:17.966 --> 00:32:19.636 A:middle
provides a security that users

00:32:19.636 --> 00:32:21.396 A:middle
need and the features that they

00:32:21.396 --> 00:32:24.686 A:middle
love while getting logged in.

00:32:26.176 --> 00:32:27.876 A:middle
There are many improvements to

00:32:27.876 --> 00:32:29.476 A:middle
Safari View Controller on iOS

00:32:29.476 --> 00:32:30.056 A:middle
11.

00:32:30.536 --> 00:32:31.806 A:middle
Safari View Controller's new

00:32:31.806 --> 00:32:33.686 A:middle
look and the new APIs that we've

00:32:33.686 --> 00:32:35.806 A:middle
introduced can help Safari View

00:32:35.806 --> 00:32:37.616 A:middle
Controller feel at home in your

00:32:37.986 --> 00:32:38.053 A:middle
app.

00:32:40.266 --> 00:32:41.926 A:middle
If you've taken a look at Safari

00:32:41.926 --> 00:32:43.806 A:middle
View Controller in the past but

00:32:43.806 --> 00:32:45.216 A:middle
maybe it didn't quite fit your

00:32:45.216 --> 00:32:46.936 A:middle
use case, we encourage you to

00:32:46.936 --> 00:32:47.806 A:middle
take another look.

00:32:48.896 --> 00:32:50.666 A:middle
These improvements on iOS 11 and

00:32:50.906 --> 00:32:52.546 A:middle
the APIs that have been added

00:32:52.756 --> 00:32:53.786 A:middle
were inspired by you.

00:32:54.656 --> 00:32:55.666 A:middle
So, we really hope there's

00:32:55.666 --> 00:32:57.756 A:middle
something in there for you.

00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:00.576 A:middle
For more information on this

00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:00.576 A:middle
For more information on this

00:33:00.576 --> 00:33:02.256 A:middle
session you can view the page

00:33:02.296 --> 00:33:02.856 A:middle
listed here.

00:33:02.856 --> 00:33:06.856 A:middle
I'd like to tell you about some

00:33:06.856 --> 00:33:08.146 A:middle
related sessions that you might

00:33:08.146 --> 00:33:09.096 A:middle
be interested in.

00:33:09.696 --> 00:33:11.356 A:middle
These are all available on the

00:33:11.356 --> 00:33:12.936 A:middle
WWDC website and app.

00:33:14.116 --> 00:33:15.286 A:middle
We've talked a lot about getting

00:33:15.286 --> 00:33:16.636 A:middle
your user authenticated with a

00:33:16.706 --> 00:33:18.286 A:middle
third-party service using Safari

00:33:18.286 --> 00:33:18.956 A:middle
View Controller.

00:33:19.686 --> 00:33:20.546 A:middle
But if you want to make

00:33:20.866 --> 00:33:22.116 A:middle
authenticating with your own

00:33:22.156 --> 00:33:23.516 A:middle
service a better experience for

00:33:23.516 --> 00:33:24.906 A:middle
your users you can watch
