[ Audience Applause ]

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:20.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:22.226 A:middle
[ Audience Applause ]

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:22.826 A:middle
Perfect.

00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:24.216 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:27.136 A:middle
So, welcome to today's session,

00:00:27.346 --> 00:00:29.226 A:middle
Introduction to PDFKit on iOS.

00:00:29.886 --> 00:00:31.206 A:middle
So much has changed in the last

00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:32.566 A:middle
twelve months, and we are super

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.126 A:middle
excited to show you all of those

00:00:34.126 --> 00:00:35.186 A:middle
changes and all of the big

00:00:35.186 --> 00:00:35.906 A:middle
improvements.

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:37.886 A:middle
But before we begin, we should

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:38.726 A:middle
introduce ourselves.

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:39.786 A:middle
My name is Jeremy Bridon.

00:00:39.786 --> 00:00:40.926 A:middle
I'm a Software Engineer here at

00:00:40.926 --> 00:00:42.326 A:middle
Apple working on Core Graphics,

00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:42.696 A:middle
and --

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:44.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm Nicki Brower, also a

00:00:44.256 --> 00:00:45.616 A:middle
Software Engineer here at Apple.

00:00:45.876 --> 00:00:46.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

00:00:47.606 --> 00:00:47.926 A:middle
All right.

00:00:48.346 --> 00:00:49.456 A:middle
So, we've got a lot to talk

00:00:49.456 --> 00:00:50.566 A:middle
about today, but the very first

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:51.326 A:middle
thing we're going to be talking

00:00:51.326 --> 00:00:52.956 A:middle
about is the PDF file format

00:00:52.956 --> 00:00:53.516 A:middle
itself.

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:55.396 A:middle
We're then going to give a nice

00:00:55.396 --> 00:00:56.826 A:middle
little discussion over the

00:00:57.116 --> 00:00:59.216 A:middle
framework itself, followed by a

00:00:59.216 --> 00:01:00.526 A:middle
discussion on the document, page

00:00:59.216 --> 00:01:00.526 A:middle
discussion on the document, page

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.256 A:middle
and annotations model of that

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:02.626 A:middle
framework.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:04.556 A:middle
We're finally going to do a deep

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:06.016 A:middle
dive into annotations.

00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:07.666 A:middle
So, annotations are something

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.016 A:middle
that we changed a lot this year

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:10.016 A:middle
based on feedback from

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:10.986 A:middle
developers like you.

00:01:11.256 --> 00:01:12.396 A:middle
So, we want to put some extra

00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:13.766 A:middle
effort into explaining all of

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:14.386 A:middle
that this year.

00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:17.196 A:middle
Finally, for developers, old and

00:01:17.196 --> 00:01:18.326 A:middle
new, we're going to do a

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:19.886 A:middle
discussion on best practices,

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:21.276 A:middle
things that we recommend you do.

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:22.496 A:middle
All right.

00:01:23.526 --> 00:01:24.976 A:middle
But first, let's talk about the

00:01:24.976 --> 00:01:27.896 A:middle
PDF file format spec being 1300

00:01:28.136 --> 00:01:30.446 A:middle
pages, a totally unacceptable

00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:32.516 A:middle
number to try and understand how

00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:33.786 A:middle
the PDF file format works.

00:01:33.786 --> 00:01:35.436 A:middle
Right? You are app developers.

00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:36.266 A:middle
We want you to create these

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:37.906 A:middle
awesome applications without

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:39.486 A:middle
worrying about the details of

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.476 A:middle
the specification.

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:42.236 A:middle
So, we've created an awesome

00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:43.526 A:middle
framework that gives you the

00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:45.606 A:middle
power of PDF without you having

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:46.686 A:middle
to read all those details.

00:01:47.136 --> 00:01:48.376 A:middle
We read it, so you don't have

00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:50.026 A:middle
to, all right.

00:01:50.446 --> 00:01:51.706 A:middle
So, why use PDFs in the first

00:01:51.706 --> 00:01:52.096 A:middle
place?

00:01:52.176 --> 00:01:53.946 A:middle
Well, they're this kind of

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:55.226 A:middle
universal business format.

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:57.106 A:middle
They're universal and used in

00:01:57.106 --> 00:01:58.666 A:middle
medical, financial, government,

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:01.086 A:middle
and business applications, and

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:01.086 A:middle
and business applications, and

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:02.136 A:middle
they're done so because they've

00:02:02.136 --> 00:02:04.076 A:middle
got these wonderful features,

00:02:04.076 --> 00:02:05.906 A:middle
features like strong encryption

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:07.656 A:middle
or a variable permission model.

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:09.036 A:middle
So, some really, really nice

00:02:09.036 --> 00:02:10.205 A:middle
things directly applicable to

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:12.076 A:middle
you as developers, and then also

00:02:12.076 --> 00:02:13.396 A:middle
for business needs.

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:15.626 A:middle
What is also really cool about

00:02:15.626 --> 00:02:17.176 A:middle
PDF is it's this interactive

00:02:17.176 --> 00:02:17.536 A:middle
model.

00:02:17.616 --> 00:02:19.056 A:middle
Right? It's not just a static

00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:20.466 A:middle
document that you print and you

00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:21.106 A:middle
forget about it.

00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:22.826 A:middle
No, it's this document that's

00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:24.606 A:middle
fully interactive in the digital

00:02:24.606 --> 00:02:25.886 A:middle
world, so I'm going to give you

00:02:25.886 --> 00:02:26.906 A:middle
the tools that allow you to

00:02:26.906 --> 00:02:28.346 A:middle
interact with those documents on

00:02:28.346 --> 00:02:29.016 A:middle
our platform.

00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:31.706 A:middle
So, of course, if you do

00:02:31.706 --> 00:02:32.766 A:middle
interact with the document,

00:02:32.876 --> 00:02:34.326 A:middle
what's great is what you see in

00:02:34.326 --> 00:02:35.506 A:middle
the digital world is what you

00:02:35.506 --> 00:02:37.006 A:middle
eventually see printed out in

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:37.726 A:middle
the physical world.

00:02:38.186 --> 00:02:39.926 A:middle
But it's this really complicated

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:41.416 A:middle
spec, and there's so many

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:42.506 A:middle
details to worry about.

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:44.356 A:middle
How can we kind of handle those

00:02:44.356 --> 00:02:45.056 A:middle
issues today?

00:02:45.446 --> 00:02:45.776 A:middle
Nicki?

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay.

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:49.636 A:middle
So, we're excited about PDFs,

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.226 A:middle
and we want to include them in

00:02:51.226 --> 00:02:51.996 A:middle
our application.

00:02:52.336 --> 00:02:52.936 A:middle
How do we do that?

00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:54.886 A:middle
Well, we already have a solution

00:02:54.886 --> 00:02:56.356 A:middle
for you, and it's a lower level

00:02:56.356 --> 00:02:57.496 A:middle
solution, and it's using the

00:02:57.496 --> 00:02:58.996 A:middle
CoreGraphics PDF Framework.

00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:00.756 A:middle
This framework is great because

00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:00.756 A:middle
This framework is great because

00:03:00.756 --> 00:03:02.016 A:middle
it has a one-to-one drawing

00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:03.366 A:middle
model with the PDF Spec. It

00:03:03.856 --> 00:03:05.556 A:middle
allows you to read and write and

00:03:05.556 --> 00:03:07.736 A:middle
modify your documents, and it

00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:09.146 A:middle
has a PDF presser and a PDF

00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:10.156 A:middle
renderer, so you don't have to

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:10.736 A:middle
create one.

00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:12.486 A:middle
There are some limitations

00:03:12.486 --> 00:03:12.716 A:middle
though.

00:03:13.186 --> 00:03:14.406 A:middle
Because it doesn't have any

00:03:14.406 --> 00:03:15.926 A:middle
AppKit primitives, that means

00:03:15.926 --> 00:03:17.076 A:middle
you don't get any live

00:03:17.076 --> 00:03:18.176 A:middle
interaction with the document.

00:03:18.676 --> 00:03:20.116 A:middle
That means no text selection, no

00:03:20.316 --> 00:03:22.346 A:middle
highlighting search results, no

00:03:22.346 --> 00:03:23.586 A:middle
interaction with annotations,

00:03:23.586 --> 00:03:24.886 A:middle
and it doesn't have any

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:25.856 A:middle
accessibility support.

00:03:26.216 --> 00:03:27.946 A:middle
Well, this is where PDFKit comes

00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:28.166 A:middle
in.

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:30.516 A:middle
So, PDFKit is based on the

00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:32.006 A:middle
CoreGraphics Framework, but it

00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:33.936 A:middle
also includes AppKit, so you get

00:03:33.936 --> 00:03:35.106 A:middle
that live interaction with the

00:03:35.106 --> 00:03:35.596 A:middle
document.

00:03:36.086 --> 00:03:37.926 A:middle
And now, as of this year, we are

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.166 A:middle
now on iOS; so not just AppKit

00:03:40.296 --> 00:03:41.356 A:middle
but UIKit as well.

00:03:41.756 --> 00:03:43.326 A:middle
So, it's now even easier to

00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:45.456 A:middle
open, modify, and draw your

00:03:45.456 --> 00:03:46.576 A:middle
PDFs, but now you do get that

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:47.226 A:middle
interaction.

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:48.806 A:middle
You can select text; you can

00:03:48.806 --> 00:03:49.906 A:middle
interact with the annotations,

00:03:50.016 --> 00:03:51.776 A:middle
and I want to point out that

00:03:51.776 --> 00:03:53.836 A:middle
this year we have made a great

00:03:53.836 --> 00:03:54.836 A:middle
effort to improve our

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:55.836 A:middle
accessibility support.

00:03:56.426 --> 00:03:58.346 A:middle
So, by just using PDFKit, you

00:03:58.346 --> 00:04:00.516 A:middle
get voiceover, text extraction,

00:03:58.346 --> 00:04:00.516 A:middle
get voiceover, text extraction,

00:04:00.786 --> 00:04:01.956 A:middle
being able to fill out forms,

00:04:01.956 --> 00:04:03.336 A:middle
all for free.

00:04:04.696 --> 00:04:05.236 A:middle
All right.

00:04:05.236 --> 00:04:06.016 A:middle
Let's take a look at where

00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:06.976 A:middle
PDFKit is today.

00:04:09.876 --> 00:04:11.496 A:middle
On the Mac, you can see it's

00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:13.246 A:middle
used by Preview and Safari,

00:04:13.246 --> 00:04:14.846 A:middle
which are our main clients, but

00:04:14.846 --> 00:04:16.166 A:middle
we're all over the platform as

00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:16.406 A:middle
well.

00:04:16.836 --> 00:04:18.946 A:middle
I just mentioned one, iOS, so

00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:20.326 A:middle
you can see it's being used by

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:22.125 A:middle
iBooks, Mail, and QuickLooks,

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:23.446 A:middle
and hopefully we'll be able to

00:04:23.446 --> 00:04:24.546 A:middle
add a few of your apps to this

00:04:24.546 --> 00:04:25.686 A:middle
list as well.

00:04:26.676 --> 00:04:27.856 A:middle
Let's take a look at our

00:04:27.886 --> 00:04:28.836 A:middle
framework overview.

00:04:29.396 --> 00:04:30.706 A:middle
So, all of the classes in PDFKit

00:04:30.706 --> 00:04:32.286 A:middle
can be put into one of three

00:04:32.286 --> 00:04:32.856 A:middle
categories.

00:04:33.256 --> 00:04:34.716 A:middle
These are our View, Document,

00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:36.766 A:middle
and Support categories, and each

00:04:36.766 --> 00:04:38.596 A:middle
of these have their own list of

00:04:38.596 --> 00:04:39.306 A:middle
classes as well.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.536 A:middle
So, we have our View, which has

00:04:41.536 --> 00:04:43.606 A:middle
a PDFView and PDFThumbnailView.

00:04:43.906 --> 00:04:45.646 A:middle
Since we're cross platform, this

00:04:45.646 --> 00:04:47.446 A:middle
means on Mac OS, it's going to

00:04:47.446 --> 00:04:48.656 A:middle
be an NSView, and on iOS, a

00:04:48.746 --> 00:04:49.276 A:middle
UIView.

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:51.216 A:middle
For Document, we have

00:04:51.216 --> 00:04:52.436 A:middle
PDFDocument, Page, and

00:04:52.436 --> 00:04:54.086 A:middle
Annotation, which we'll go into

00:04:54.086 --> 00:04:54.676 A:middle
further later.

00:04:55.476 --> 00:04:56.626 A:middle
But we also have our Support

00:04:56.626 --> 00:04:57.116 A:middle
classes.

00:04:57.456 --> 00:04:58.326 A:middle
These are things like

00:04:58.326 --> 00:05:00.646 A:middle
PDFSelection to PDFTextSelection

00:04:58.326 --> 00:05:00.646 A:middle
PDFSelection to PDFTextSelection

00:05:00.646 --> 00:05:02.486 A:middle
I mentioned, PDFOutline to

00:05:02.486 --> 00:05:03.706 A:middle
create a table of contents,

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:06.906 A:middle
PDFAction to jump to a URL, and

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:07.246 A:middle
a few more.

00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:09.706 A:middle
But when it comes down to it,

00:05:09.706 --> 00:05:10.906 A:middle
there are really just four core

00:05:10.906 --> 00:05:12.636 A:middle
classes that do the majority of

00:05:12.866 --> 00:05:13.796 A:middle
what you might want to do with a

00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:15.326 A:middle
PDF, and these are PDFView,

00:05:15.326 --> 00:05:16.486 A:middle
PDFDocument, Page, and

00:05:16.486 --> 00:05:17.000 A:middle
Annotation.

00:05:18.606 --> 00:05:21.946 A:middle
But to simplify it even more, to

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.646 A:middle
create a bare bones application

00:05:23.646 --> 00:05:25.426 A:middle
to display PDF and interact with

00:05:25.426 --> 00:05:26.746 A:middle
it, all you really need to know

00:05:26.746 --> 00:05:28.596 A:middle
about is PDFView, and Jeremy's

00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:29.326 A:middle
going to show you how to do

00:05:29.326 --> 00:05:29.660 A:middle
that.

00:05:32.516 --> 00:05:40.016 A:middle
[ Audience Applause ]

00:05:40.516 --> 00:05:41.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Awesome!

00:05:41.486 --> 00:05:42.386 A:middle
Thank you very much, Nicki.

00:05:42.936 --> 00:05:43.396 A:middle
All right.

00:05:43.396 --> 00:05:44.826 A:middle
So, we really want to emphasize,

00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:47.226 A:middle
you get the power of PDF really

00:05:47.226 --> 00:05:48.786 A:middle
straightforward with a lot of

00:05:49.076 --> 00:05:51.166 A:middle
simple easy use of PDFKit.

00:05:51.566 --> 00:05:53.176 A:middle
What that means is got the demo

00:05:53.176 --> 00:05:53.686 A:middle
application.

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:54.916 A:middle
It's a desktop application.

00:05:55.196 --> 00:05:56.296 A:middle
It's really straightforward.

00:05:56.296 --> 00:05:57.626 A:middle
It's got a View Controller and a

00:05:57.626 --> 00:05:58.866 A:middle
View; nothing else.

00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:00.506 A:middle
And in the View Controller

00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:00.506 A:middle
And in the View Controller

00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:01.606 A:middle
source code, and we could

00:06:01.606 --> 00:06:01.896 A:middle
review.

00:06:01.896 --> 00:06:03.366 A:middle
There's only three bits of code

00:06:03.366 --> 00:06:03.966 A:middle
that we care about.

00:06:04.586 --> 00:06:06.126 A:middle
The first is we instantiate a

00:06:06.126 --> 00:06:08.256 A:middle
PDFView with the parent bounds,

00:06:08.256 --> 00:06:09.176 A:middle
and we know that it's filling

00:06:09.176 --> 00:06:10.146 A:middle
that window in Startup.

00:06:10.726 --> 00:06:12.176 A:middle
We then use Auto Resize to make

00:06:12.176 --> 00:06:13.786 A:middle
sure that that view always fills

00:06:13.946 --> 00:06:15.566 A:middle
that window, so even if we

00:06:15.566 --> 00:06:16.796 A:middle
resize the window, it'll always

00:06:16.796 --> 00:06:17.326 A:middle
be fitted.

00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:19.446 A:middle
And finally, the only actual

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:21.686 A:middle
true bit of PDFKit code is we

00:06:21.686 --> 00:06:22.846 A:middle
allow Dragging.

00:06:23.246 --> 00:06:24.906 A:middle
What that means is if I launch

00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:26.786 A:middle
the application, I can drag and

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:29.086 A:middle
drop a PDF file that I have, in

00:06:29.086 --> 00:06:31.476 A:middle
this case from Desktop, and it's

00:06:31.476 --> 00:06:32.896 A:middle
a fully interactive view that

00:06:32.896 --> 00:06:35.076 A:middle
has all of the same look, feel,

00:06:35.136 --> 00:06:37.326 A:middle
and features as Preview, Safari,

00:06:37.326 --> 00:06:38.786 A:middle
and all of these other first

00:06:38.786 --> 00:06:39.606 A:middle
party applications.

00:06:40.136 --> 00:06:41.356 A:middle
And what I mean by that is

00:06:41.466 --> 00:06:42.746 A:middle
there's text selection for free.

00:06:42.866 --> 00:06:44.166 A:middle
There's the viewer, of course.

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:45.476 A:middle
If we go to the Table of

00:06:45.476 --> 00:06:46.286 A:middle
Contents, it's fully

00:06:46.286 --> 00:06:46.776 A:middle
interactive.

00:06:46.916 --> 00:06:47.816 A:middle
I could click and jump

00:06:47.816 --> 00:06:48.216 A:middle
somewhere.

00:06:48.536 --> 00:06:49.676 A:middle
I could also right-click and

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:51.556 A:middle
maybe change my display layout,

00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:52.866 A:middle
change a lot of other options.

00:06:52.866 --> 00:06:54.396 A:middle
I could copy and search text.

00:06:55.336 --> 00:06:56.636 A:middle
What's really cool about this is

00:06:56.636 --> 00:06:57.816 A:middle
all of these features are also

00:06:57.816 --> 00:06:59.446 A:middle
available to you as a developer

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.756 A:middle
where you could programmatically

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.756 A:middle
where you could programmatically

00:07:00.756 --> 00:07:01.996 A:middle
drive these kinds of changes.

00:07:03.286 --> 00:07:05.766 A:middle
All right.

00:07:06.326 --> 00:07:07.666 A:middle
So, I've introduced PDFView kind

00:07:07.666 --> 00:07:08.806 A:middle
of casually, but let me give you

00:07:08.866 --> 00:07:10.166 A:middle
some more details.

00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:12.596 A:middle
It's this fully customizable but

00:07:12.596 --> 00:07:14.186 A:middle
easy to use PDFViewer.

00:07:14.756 --> 00:07:15.546 A:middle
And when I say fully

00:07:15.546 --> 00:07:16.756 A:middle
customizable, what I mean is

00:07:16.756 --> 00:07:17.636 A:middle
this, how you could change the

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:19.636 A:middle
layout, direction, page padding;

00:07:19.916 --> 00:07:21.076 A:middle
you could also change so many

00:07:21.076 --> 00:07:22.536 A:middle
more like zoom factors and zoom

00:07:22.536 --> 00:07:23.106 A:middle
behavior.

00:07:23.666 --> 00:07:25.006 A:middle
This is also the appropriate

00:07:25.006 --> 00:07:26.916 A:middle
place to do view-to-content and

00:07:26.916 --> 00:07:28.186 A:middle
content-to-view coordinate

00:07:28.186 --> 00:07:28.696 A:middle
transforms.

00:07:29.086 --> 00:07:30.606 A:middle
What that means is if you use

00:07:30.606 --> 00:07:31.866 A:middle
your finger on iOS, and you tap

00:07:32.006 --> 00:07:33.716 A:middle
that PDFView, we actually can

00:07:33.716 --> 00:07:35.026 A:middle
transform that tap and figure

00:07:35.026 --> 00:07:35.846 A:middle
out where exactly in the

00:07:35.976 --> 00:07:37.606 A:middle
document and in that page you

00:07:37.606 --> 00:07:38.116 A:middle
are touching.

00:07:39.746 --> 00:07:41.496 A:middle
Now, I've mentioned there's a,

00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:43.346 A:middle
that they're easy to use, so I

00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:44.156 A:middle
want to give you kind of a

00:07:44.156 --> 00:07:45.306 A:middle
simple straightforward example

00:07:45.306 --> 00:07:46.606 A:middle
of setting that document to a

00:07:46.606 --> 00:07:47.276 A:middle
PDFView.

00:07:47.596 --> 00:07:49.216 A:middle
Here in SWF, we're initializing

00:07:49.216 --> 00:07:51.546 A:middle
a document with a URL, and then

00:07:51.546 --> 00:07:52.746 A:middle
we assign that document to the

00:07:52.746 --> 00:07:53.436 A:middle
View itself.

00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:55.506 A:middle
We take care of everything else.

00:07:55.956 --> 00:07:57.136 A:middle
No matter what content is in

00:07:57.136 --> 00:07:58.486 A:middle
that document, we will show it

00:07:58.486 --> 00:07:59.296 A:middle
in PDFView.

00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:02.596 A:middle
So, I mentioned more of these

00:08:02.596 --> 00:08:03.416 A:middle
display settings.

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:04.506 A:middle
I want to show you a couple of

00:08:04.506 --> 00:08:05.566 A:middle
the enumerations.

00:08:05.926 --> 00:08:07.856 A:middle
PDFDisplay mode is really cool

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:09.016 A:middle
because you can actually change

00:08:09.286 --> 00:08:11.006 A:middle
that setup of the document in

00:08:11.006 --> 00:08:11.756 A:middle
your PDFView.

00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:13.636 A:middle
So, the first denom is single

00:08:13.636 --> 00:08:14.976 A:middle
page and, of course, you see one

00:08:14.976 --> 00:08:15.796 A:middle
page at a time.

00:08:16.206 --> 00:08:17.446 A:middle
There's also single page

00:08:17.446 --> 00:08:19.156 A:middle
continuous, and what that means

00:08:19.156 --> 00:08:20.826 A:middle
is it's the series of pages laid

00:08:20.826 --> 00:08:21.986 A:middle
out on the vertical column.

00:08:22.556 --> 00:08:24.046 A:middle
There's also two up modes, so

00:08:24.046 --> 00:08:24.946 A:middle
you could kind of get this

00:08:24.996 --> 00:08:26.706 A:middle
iBooks look and feel, and

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:27.936 A:middle
there's, of course, two up

00:08:27.936 --> 00:08:29.496 A:middle
continuous; so, a lot of

00:08:29.496 --> 00:08:29.976 A:middle
options.

00:08:30.986 --> 00:08:33.366 A:middle
Next up, new to 2017 is going to

00:08:33.366 --> 00:08:34.546 A:middle
be Display Direction.

00:08:34.546 --> 00:08:35.546 A:middle
So, if you look at the

00:08:35.546 --> 00:08:36.746 A:middle
continuous modes, you don't have

00:08:36.785 --> 00:08:37.876 A:middle
to do vertical; you could also

00:08:37.876 --> 00:08:39.706 A:middle
do horizontal; and of course,

00:08:39.706 --> 00:08:40.876 A:middle
this is available on both

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:41.765 A:middle
platforms today.

00:08:42.706 --> 00:08:44.746 A:middle
There's also, unique to iOS this

00:08:44.746 --> 00:08:46.356 A:middle
year, the View Pagification.

00:08:46.696 --> 00:08:47.876 A:middle
What that means is we want to

00:08:47.876 --> 00:08:49.226 A:middle
give you the same look and feel

00:08:49.226 --> 00:08:50.866 A:middle
as iBooks in your application;

00:08:50.866 --> 00:08:52.426 A:middle
so, you could do so by turning

00:08:52.426 --> 00:08:53.086 A:middle
on that feature.

00:08:53.596 --> 00:08:54.516 A:middle
So, here, you could put your

00:08:54.516 --> 00:08:55.666 A:middle
finger on the device, you could

00:08:55.666 --> 00:08:56.846 A:middle
swipe, and it will go ahead and

00:08:56.846 --> 00:08:58.296 A:middle
change between pages for you.

00:08:58.736 --> 00:08:59.756 A:middle
And what's cool is on this

00:08:59.816 --> 00:09:00.306 A:middle
bottom.

00:08:59.816 --> 00:09:00.306 A:middle
bottom.

00:09:00.526 --> 00:09:01.406 A:middle
Take a closer look.

00:09:02.206 --> 00:09:04.226 A:middle
We've got PDFThumbnailView, so

00:09:04.346 --> 00:09:06.036 A:middle
Feature Rich Scrubber for the

00:09:06.036 --> 00:09:07.036 A:middle
document itself.

00:09:07.166 --> 00:09:08.596 A:middle
As you move your finger across

00:09:08.656 --> 00:09:10.306 A:middle
that scrubber, it'll activate

00:09:10.306 --> 00:09:11.416 A:middle
the appropriate page that your

00:09:11.416 --> 00:09:13.106 A:middle
finger is on, and it'll update

00:09:13.106 --> 00:09:14.726 A:middle
PDFView with that active page.

00:09:14.996 --> 00:09:16.606 A:middle
But of course, if you drive that

00:09:16.606 --> 00:09:18.496 A:middle
page change with PDFView, it'll

00:09:18.496 --> 00:09:19.236 A:middle
go ahead and update

00:09:19.236 --> 00:09:20.046 A:middle
ThumbnailView as well.

00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:23.316 A:middle
ThumbnailView isn't limited just

00:09:23.316 --> 00:09:24.486 A:middle
to the horizontal access.

00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:26.106 A:middle
Of course, you can set it to the

00:09:26.106 --> 00:09:26.996 A:middle
vertical axis.

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:30.416 A:middle
So, we've talked a lot about

00:09:30.416 --> 00:09:31.646 A:middle
PDFView, but let's talk about

00:09:31.646 --> 00:09:32.856 A:middle
the core data structures

00:09:32.856 --> 00:09:34.736 A:middle
themselves, the Document, Page,

00:09:34.736 --> 00:09:36.026 A:middle
and Annotations Model.

00:09:36.206 --> 00:09:38.996 A:middle
So, PDFDocument really is a

00:09:38.996 --> 00:09:40.126 A:middle
document; no surprise.

00:09:40.126 --> 00:09:41.766 A:middle
And the document is going to be

00:09:41.766 --> 00:09:43.916 A:middle
a collection of PDFPages, and

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:45.376 A:middle
PDFPages are pretty cool because

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:46.796 A:middle
they actually own that content

00:09:47.096 --> 00:09:47.756 A:middle
from your file.

00:09:48.026 --> 00:09:49.506 A:middle
What you see on screen is owned

00:09:49.536 --> 00:09:50.716 A:middle
by PDFPage.

00:09:51.066 --> 00:09:52.526 A:middle
The PDFPage does so much more

00:09:52.526 --> 00:09:53.846 A:middle
because it's also an owner of

00:09:54.016 --> 00:09:55.546 A:middle
all the annotations that you see

00:09:55.546 --> 00:09:56.216 A:middle
on screen.

00:09:57.416 --> 00:09:59.376 A:middle
So, Document has pages, Pages

00:09:59.376 --> 00:10:01.566 A:middle
has content and annotations, and

00:09:59.376 --> 00:10:01.566 A:middle
has content and annotations, and

00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:03.216 A:middle
to actually create a document,

00:10:03.216 --> 00:10:04.326 A:middle
you could either initialize it

00:10:04.326 --> 00:10:05.746 A:middle
by itself, and author one from

00:10:05.746 --> 00:10:07.386 A:middle
scratch, or you could initialize

00:10:07.386 --> 00:10:07.976 A:middle
it with a URL.

00:10:08.046 --> 00:10:10.086 A:middle
But once you have that document,

00:10:10.086 --> 00:10:11.296 A:middle
you could modify the collection

00:10:11.296 --> 00:10:11.766 A:middle
of pages.

00:10:12.056 --> 00:10:13.746 A:middle
You could add, swap, insert, and

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:14.516 A:middle
remove pages.

00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:16.696 A:middle
PDFDocument is also really

00:10:16.696 --> 00:10:17.976 A:middle
powerful because this is where

00:10:17.976 --> 00:10:19.496 A:middle
you could decrypt the document

00:10:19.496 --> 00:10:20.746 A:middle
and also save it with

00:10:20.746 --> 00:10:21.356 A:middle
encryption.

00:10:21.606 --> 00:10:22.546 A:middle
So, we give you that full

00:10:22.546 --> 00:10:24.036 A:middle
feature of encryption both on

00:10:24.036 --> 00:10:25.276 A:middle
opening and saving.

00:10:25.766 --> 00:10:26.966 A:middle
It also gives you access to

00:10:26.966 --> 00:10:28.256 A:middle
check what permissions you have

00:10:28.256 --> 00:10:28.836 A:middle
on the document.

00:10:29.026 --> 00:10:30.166 A:middle
So, as you unlock it, it's

00:10:30.206 --> 00:10:31.326 A:middle
really important that you check

00:10:31.396 --> 00:10:32.686 A:middle
what could you actually do with

00:10:32.686 --> 00:10:33.316 A:middle
that document.

00:10:34.016 --> 00:10:35.156 A:middle
This is also where you could get

00:10:35.156 --> 00:10:36.366 A:middle
the attributes of a document, so

00:10:36.366 --> 00:10:37.386 A:middle
you could figure out who

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:38.676 A:middle
authored it, when it was

00:10:38.676 --> 00:10:39.886 A:middle
authored, what tools did they

00:10:39.886 --> 00:10:40.606 A:middle
use to author it.

00:10:41.136 --> 00:10:42.666 A:middle
And finally, a really nice

00:10:42.666 --> 00:10:43.726 A:middle
feature, if you want to ever

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:45.086 A:middle
search the document, and the

00:10:45.086 --> 00:10:46.466 A:middle
document strings, you could do

00:10:46.466 --> 00:10:46.696 A:middle
so.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.656 A:middle
PDFDocument has a series of APIs

00:10:48.656 --> 00:10:49.886 A:middle
to do exactly that.

00:10:50.346 --> 00:10:52.416 A:middle
Let me give you a full, an

00:10:52.536 --> 00:10:53.896 A:middle
example, something you kind of

00:10:53.896 --> 00:10:55.306 A:middle
saw earlier, which is we're

00:10:55.306 --> 00:10:56.706 A:middle
going to set a Document on a

00:10:56.706 --> 00:10:58.296 A:middle
view, but I wanted to show you

00:10:58.296 --> 00:10:59.626 A:middle
the explicit path of, we're

00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:00.926 A:middle
going to initialize the document

00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:00.926 A:middle
going to initialize the document

00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:01.986 A:middle
by checking your bundle.

00:11:01.986 --> 00:11:03.296 A:middle
Does it have the PDF file in

00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:03.666 A:middle
question?

00:11:03.666 --> 00:11:05.536 A:middle
If it does, then go ahead and

00:11:05.536 --> 00:11:06.776 A:middle
try to initialize that PDF

00:11:06.776 --> 00:11:08.816 A:middle
document, and on success, just

00:11:08.816 --> 00:11:09.566 A:middle
assign it to the View.

00:11:09.796 --> 00:11:11.106 A:middle
We take care of everything else

00:11:11.146 --> 00:11:11.456 A:middle
for you.

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:13.716 A:middle
A couple of more examples, if

00:11:13.716 --> 00:11:15.186 A:middle
you want to save the file, it's

00:11:15.186 --> 00:11:16.076 A:middle
really straightforward.

00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:17.736 A:middle
Just do write method call with

00:11:17.766 --> 00:11:18.816 A:middle
that new file path.

00:11:19.486 --> 00:11:20.766 A:middle
Let's say you want to save width

00:11:20.766 --> 00:11:22.316 A:middle
encryption; it's really

00:11:22.316 --> 00:11:23.156 A:middle
straightforward too.

00:11:23.276 --> 00:11:25.706 A:middle
Do a writeto with options, and

00:11:25.706 --> 00:11:26.496 A:middle
then the options is the

00:11:26.496 --> 00:11:28.006 A:middle
dictionary where we map special

00:11:28.006 --> 00:11:29.346 A:middle
enumerations in the header file

00:11:29.776 --> 00:11:31.046 A:middle
with a password that you care

00:11:31.046 --> 00:11:31.266 A:middle
about.

00:11:31.666 --> 00:11:32.576 A:middle
So, here, I'm saving the

00:11:32.576 --> 00:11:33.696 A:middle
document with full honor

00:11:33.696 --> 00:11:34.916 A:middle
permissions, and you could only

00:11:34.916 --> 00:11:36.576 A:middle
open it using my password Apple.

00:11:36.576 --> 00:11:39.116 A:middle
A couple of more examples, if

00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:40.746 A:middle
you want to retrieve a page, we

00:11:40.746 --> 00:11:43.286 A:middle
use a base 0 index system.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:44.676 A:middle
What that means is the first

00:11:44.676 --> 00:11:46.346 A:middle
page is an index 0; second page

00:11:46.346 --> 00:11:47.646 A:middle
is an index 1, etcetera.

00:11:47.826 --> 00:11:49.506 A:middle
So, retrieving the first page is

00:11:49.506 --> 00:11:51.676 A:middle
as simple as doing .page at and

00:11:51.676 --> 00:11:52.576 A:middle
give us that index.

00:11:53.266 --> 00:11:54.516 A:middle
The second one is if you want to

00:11:54.516 --> 00:11:55.976 A:middle
insert a page, you could do so

00:11:55.976 --> 00:11:57.556 A:middle
with a page and an index.

00:11:58.276 --> 00:11:59.756 A:middle
If you want to exchange pages,

00:11:59.756 --> 00:12:01.096 A:middle
just give us two indices.

00:11:59.756 --> 00:12:01.096 A:middle
just give us two indices.

00:12:01.876 --> 00:12:03.196 A:middle
Finally, if you want to remove a

00:12:03.196 --> 00:12:04.986 A:middle
page, again, just pass us an

00:12:04.986 --> 00:12:05.376 A:middle
index.

00:12:05.376 --> 00:12:06.896 A:middle
We will take care of the full

00:12:06.896 --> 00:12:07.976 A:middle
document construction when you

00:12:07.976 --> 00:12:09.756 A:middle
mutate it and save it out to

00:12:09.756 --> 00:12:10.000 A:middle
disc.

00:12:11.866 --> 00:12:13.296 A:middle
Now, I've mentioned encryption

00:12:13.296 --> 00:12:14.486 A:middle
when you save, but let me show

00:12:14.486 --> 00:12:15.886 A:middle
you an [inaudible] example when

00:12:15.886 --> 00:12:16.916 A:middle
you open the file.

00:12:17.266 --> 00:12:18.916 A:middle
So, here, I'm initializing a PDF

00:12:18.946 --> 00:12:20.736 A:middle
document from a given URL, and

00:12:20.736 --> 00:12:22.096 A:middle
the very first thing I need to

00:12:22.096 --> 00:12:23.976 A:middle
do is I need to check, is this

00:12:23.976 --> 00:12:25.236 A:middle
document actually encrypted?

00:12:25.526 --> 00:12:26.916 A:middle
If it is, no problem.

00:12:26.916 --> 00:12:28.266 A:middle
I'm going to try to decrypt it.

00:12:28.266 --> 00:12:29.476 A:middle
I'm going to decrypt it by using

00:12:29.476 --> 00:12:31.406 A:middle
the method unlockwithPassword.

00:12:31.896 --> 00:12:32.906 A:middle
And unsuccess.

00:12:32.906 --> 00:12:33.806 A:middle
That's great.

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:35.196 A:middle
I just need to do one more

00:12:35.196 --> 00:12:36.016 A:middle
thing, which is I need to

00:12:36.016 --> 00:12:37.746 A:middle
actually check what my role and

00:12:37.746 --> 00:12:38.656 A:middle
my permissions are.

00:12:39.586 --> 00:12:41.186 A:middle
What I mean by role is that the

00:12:41.186 --> 00:12:42.686 A:middle
PDF document file format has

00:12:42.726 --> 00:12:44.036 A:middle
this really cool idea that you

00:12:44.036 --> 00:12:45.006 A:middle
could unlock a document with

00:12:45.006 --> 00:12:46.486 A:middle
actually two passwords, right.

00:12:46.696 --> 00:12:48.006 A:middle
You've got your owner password,

00:12:48.006 --> 00:12:49.276 A:middle
which has full permissions over

00:12:49.276 --> 00:12:49.826 A:middle
the document.

00:12:49.826 --> 00:12:51.386 A:middle
You could copy, paste, share it,

00:12:51.616 --> 00:12:53.566 A:middle
print it out, or you could have

00:12:53.566 --> 00:12:54.886 A:middle
a limited role, like maybe the

00:12:54.886 --> 00:12:55.626 A:middle
user role.

00:12:55.926 --> 00:12:57.256 A:middle
And with this limited role, you

00:12:57.256 --> 00:12:58.526 A:middle
might have variable permissions.

00:12:58.886 --> 00:13:01.426 A:middle
Maybe you can copy, maybe you

00:12:58.886 --> 00:13:01.426 A:middle
Maybe you can copy, maybe you

00:13:01.426 --> 00:13:02.736 A:middle
can print, but it's not

00:13:02.736 --> 00:13:04.166 A:middle
guaranteed, and as app

00:13:04.266 --> 00:13:05.736 A:middle
developers, it's critical that

00:13:05.736 --> 00:13:07.036 A:middle
when you do unlock a document,

00:13:07.376 --> 00:13:08.486 A:middle
check these privileges.

00:13:08.776 --> 00:13:10.506 A:middle
The reason why is PDFKit will

00:13:10.506 --> 00:13:11.986 A:middle
enforce these privileges for

00:13:11.986 --> 00:13:12.176 A:middle
you.

00:13:12.586 --> 00:13:13.796 A:middle
So, if you open a document, and

00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:15.236 A:middle
you can't copy it, right, it's

00:13:15.236 --> 00:13:16.826 A:middle
really a bad user experience not

00:13:16.826 --> 00:13:18.256 A:middle
to understand why you can't copy

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:18.346 A:middle
it.

00:13:18.676 --> 00:13:19.726 A:middle
So, you could check this and

00:13:19.726 --> 00:13:21.026 A:middle
maybe communicate to the user,

00:13:21.026 --> 00:13:22.716 A:middle
hey, this document is unlocked,

00:13:22.906 --> 00:13:24.276 A:middle
but with the user password.

00:13:24.416 --> 00:13:25.276 A:middle
That means you don't have full

00:13:25.276 --> 00:13:26.396 A:middle
permission, and if you do want

00:13:26.396 --> 00:13:27.436 A:middle
to give us the older password,

00:13:27.726 --> 00:13:28.966 A:middle
we could try to unlock it again,

00:13:28.966 --> 00:13:30.216 A:middle
and you'll be able to copy it

00:13:30.216 --> 00:13:30.586 A:middle
after all.

00:13:32.136 --> 00:13:33.726 A:middle
So, when you unlock the

00:13:33.726 --> 00:13:35.136 A:middle
document, it returns a Boolean,

00:13:35.366 --> 00:13:36.826 A:middle
but some of these events on a

00:13:36.826 --> 00:13:38.396 A:middle
document and other classes will

00:13:38.396 --> 00:13:40.606 A:middle
post notifications and will call

00:13:40.606 --> 00:13:41.596 A:middle
optional delegates.

00:13:42.026 --> 00:13:43.426 A:middle
A couple of examples is, again,

00:13:43.646 --> 00:13:44.686 A:middle
when you unlock a document,

00:13:44.686 --> 00:13:45.846 A:middle
we'll post the document did

00:13:45.846 --> 00:13:47.066 A:middle
unlock notification.

00:13:47.446 --> 00:13:48.446 A:middle
This could have been driven by

00:13:48.446 --> 00:13:49.426 A:middle
the user because we have a

00:13:49.426 --> 00:13:51.316 A:middle
default password unlock a view.

00:13:51.946 --> 00:13:53.236 A:middle
But also, if you start saving

00:13:53.236 --> 00:13:54.426 A:middle
the document, maybe you want to

00:13:54.426 --> 00:13:55.536 A:middle
catch that in some other

00:13:55.536 --> 00:13:56.546 A:middle
observers in code.

00:13:56.816 --> 00:13:58.206 A:middle
You could do so with the

00:13:58.206 --> 00:13:59.026 A:middle
notifications.

00:13:59.126 --> 00:14:00.646 A:middle
You could also implement any of

00:13:59.126 --> 00:14:00.646 A:middle
You could also implement any of

00:14:00.646 --> 00:14:01.656 A:middle
these delegates, and they

00:14:01.756 --> 00:14:02.956 A:middle
typically match one-to-one.

00:14:03.016 --> 00:14:04.376 A:middle
They have very similar function

00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:04.666 A:middle
calls.

00:14:05.816 --> 00:14:06.176 A:middle
All right.

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:08.306 A:middle
So, we talked a lot about pages,

00:14:08.486 --> 00:14:09.546 A:middle
or excuse me, a lot about

00:14:09.546 --> 00:14:10.836 A:middle
document; let's talk about

00:14:10.876 --> 00:14:11.406 A:middle
Pages.

00:14:12.056 --> 00:14:13.666 A:middle
So, pages can be retrieved from

00:14:13.666 --> 00:14:14.796 A:middle
a document, or they can be

00:14:14.796 --> 00:14:15.986 A:middle
initialized empty; maybe you're

00:14:15.986 --> 00:14:17.516 A:middle
offering a new document, or they

00:14:17.516 --> 00:14:18.796 A:middle
could even be initialized with

00:14:18.796 --> 00:14:19.536 A:middle
an image.

00:14:19.536 --> 00:14:20.746 A:middle
That's a really helpful feature

00:14:20.746 --> 00:14:22.106 A:middle
if you're trying to translate a

00:14:22.106 --> 00:14:23.806 A:middle
collection of images into a PDF

00:14:23.806 --> 00:14:24.266 A:middle
document.

00:14:24.516 --> 00:14:25.826 A:middle
I'll show you an example later.

00:14:26.296 --> 00:14:28.076 A:middle
But also, what's powerful about

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:29.496 A:middle
PDFPages is that it's that

00:14:29.496 --> 00:14:30.646 A:middle
Annotations container.

00:14:30.646 --> 00:14:31.766 A:middle
So, if you interact with

00:14:31.826 --> 00:14:32.906 A:middle
Annotations, or if you want to

00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:35.366 A:middle
mutate Annotations, PDFPage is

00:14:35.366 --> 00:14:35.986 A:middle
where to do that.

00:14:36.726 --> 00:14:38.166 A:middle
Finally, PDFPage has a lot of

00:14:38.166 --> 00:14:39.426 A:middle
custom graphics, so if you want

00:14:39.426 --> 00:14:40.466 A:middle
to change its size, its

00:14:40.516 --> 00:14:42.306 A:middle
orientation, or if you want to

00:14:42.306 --> 00:14:43.716 A:middle
do custom graphics in that

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.196 A:middle
content, you could do so with

00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:46.156 A:middle
the PDFPage class.

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:48.796 A:middle
It also has a series of a really

00:14:48.796 --> 00:14:50.606 A:middle
powerful text selection at API.

00:14:51.186 --> 00:14:52.216 A:middle
I'll give you an example.

00:14:54.266 --> 00:14:55.746 A:middle
So, first and foremost, let's

00:14:55.746 --> 00:14:57.576 A:middle
create a PDFPage with an image.

00:14:57.576 --> 00:14:59.596 A:middle
So, I'm going to use UIImage to

00:14:59.596 --> 00:15:01.116 A:middle
go ahead and initialize an image

00:14:59.596 --> 00:15:01.116 A:middle
go ahead and initialize an image

00:15:01.156 --> 00:15:02.466 A:middle
asset, and now I'm going to

00:15:02.466 --> 00:15:03.986 A:middle
instantiate PDFPage with an

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:04.356 A:middle
image.

00:15:04.826 --> 00:15:06.406 A:middle
What's really cool about this is

00:15:06.456 --> 00:15:08.056 A:middle
if the image has special

00:15:08.056 --> 00:15:09.876 A:middle
content, like it's a P3 wide

00:15:09.876 --> 00:15:11.436 A:middle
gamic color space, we will

00:15:11.516 --> 00:15:13.006 A:middle
author that page, and eventually

00:15:13.006 --> 00:15:14.746 A:middle
the document, with that P3 color

00:15:14.746 --> 00:15:15.206 A:middle
space.

00:15:15.676 --> 00:15:17.376 A:middle
What's also nice is we default

00:15:17.376 --> 00:15:19.286 A:middle
the PDFPage to US letter, but

00:15:19.286 --> 00:15:20.266 A:middle
you could set that size to

00:15:20.266 --> 00:15:21.876 A:middle
whatever you want, but if you

00:15:21.876 --> 00:15:22.856 A:middle
initialize it with an image,

00:15:22.856 --> 00:15:24.146 A:middle
we'll always try to maintain

00:15:24.146 --> 00:15:25.586 A:middle
that image's aspect ratio in the

00:15:25.586 --> 00:15:26.966 A:middle
size in the document.

00:15:29.186 --> 00:15:30.736 A:middle
If you want to extract string

00:15:30.736 --> 00:15:31.736 A:middle
content from a PDFPage, you

00:15:31.736 --> 00:15:33.236 A:middle
could do so by just calling the

00:15:33.236 --> 00:15:34.016 A:middle
string method.

00:15:34.396 --> 00:15:36.036 A:middle
But if you want to get rich text

00:15:36.106 --> 00:15:37.196 A:middle
out of that document, you could

00:15:37.196 --> 00:15:38.826 A:middle
do so with the Attributed

00:15:38.826 --> 00:15:40.096 A:middle
string, and this has been

00:15:40.096 --> 00:15:41.356 A:middle
really, really powerful with our

00:15:41.356 --> 00:15:42.826 A:middle
improvements in accessibility.

00:15:44.256 --> 00:15:45.636 A:middle
There's also, like I mentioned

00:15:45.636 --> 00:15:47.216 A:middle
before, these really powerful

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:48.166 A:middle
text selection APIs.

00:15:48.226 --> 00:15:49.636 A:middle
I'll give you two examples.

00:15:50.096 --> 00:15:51.406 A:middle
The first one is let's say you

00:15:51.406 --> 00:15:52.836 A:middle
want to select text at a

00:15:52.836 --> 00:15:54.136 A:middle
specific character range.

00:15:54.456 --> 00:15:56.316 A:middle
You could do so by a method on

00:15:56.316 --> 00:15:57.956 A:middle
the PDFPage called Selection for

00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:58.366 A:middle
Range.

00:15:58.656 --> 00:16:00.506 A:middle
So, here, we'll select character

00:15:58.656 --> 00:16:00.506 A:middle
So, here, we'll select character

00:16:00.506 --> 00:16:01.816 A:middle
10 and for a span of 5

00:16:01.876 --> 00:16:02.286 A:middle
characters.

00:16:02.616 --> 00:16:03.736 A:middle
We'll extract that, and you

00:16:03.736 --> 00:16:04.746 A:middle
could do a lot of geometry

00:16:04.746 --> 00:16:05.936 A:middle
conversions with the PDF

00:16:05.936 --> 00:16:07.036 A:middle
selection class to figure out

00:16:07.306 --> 00:16:09.096 A:middle
where visually that is on Page.

00:16:09.716 --> 00:16:11.456 A:middle
But there's also the means of

00:16:11.456 --> 00:16:12.796 A:middle
pulling out text based on

00:16:12.796 --> 00:16:13.476 A:middle
geometry.

00:16:13.766 --> 00:16:15.146 A:middle
So, if you give us a rectangle

00:16:15.146 --> 00:16:16.626 A:middle
rather than just a span of text,

00:16:16.906 --> 00:16:18.086 A:middle
we could pull out that PDF

00:16:18.086 --> 00:16:19.386 A:middle
selection for you, and there's a

00:16:19.386 --> 00:16:20.316 A:middle
lot you could do with that.

00:16:21.236 --> 00:16:22.356 A:middle
But I want to go back to

00:16:22.406 --> 00:16:23.366 A:middle
Attributed string.

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:25.536 A:middle
I wrote a really simple desktop

00:16:25.536 --> 00:16:27.326 A:middle
application where on the left,

00:16:27.326 --> 00:16:28.466 A:middle
just like in our previous demo,

00:16:28.466 --> 00:16:30.046 A:middle
we have a drag and drop PDFView,

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:31.376 A:middle
and on the right, we've got a

00:16:31.376 --> 00:16:32.226 A:middle
Rich Text field.

00:16:33.006 --> 00:16:34.166 A:middle
And here, I'm going to drag and

00:16:34.166 --> 00:16:36.526 A:middle
drop a little user manual, and

00:16:36.526 --> 00:16:37.916 A:middle
then on the left, I'm pulling

00:16:37.916 --> 00:16:39.146 A:middle
out and publishing the

00:16:39.146 --> 00:16:39.856 A:middle
Attributed string.

00:16:40.496 --> 00:16:41.886 A:middle
And this is what's really cool

00:16:41.886 --> 00:16:43.706 A:middle
is we maintain the full content

00:16:43.706 --> 00:16:45.176 A:middle
as best as possible for text

00:16:45.176 --> 00:16:47.786 A:middle
positioning, text order, fonts,

00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:49.766 A:middle
color, bolds, and all of these

00:16:49.766 --> 00:16:50.646 A:middle
other attributes.

00:16:51.006 --> 00:16:52.226 A:middle
And it's critically important

00:16:52.226 --> 00:16:54.026 A:middle
because this gets exposed to the

00:16:54.026 --> 00:16:55.676 A:middle
accessibility system, which is

00:16:55.676 --> 00:16:57.406 A:middle
available on both Mac OS and

00:16:57.406 --> 00:16:57.626 A:middle
iOS.

00:16:58.066 --> 00:17:00.226 A:middle
That means just by adopting

00:16:58.066 --> 00:17:00.226 A:middle
That means just by adopting

00:17:00.226 --> 00:17:01.876 A:middle
PDFView, you get all of these

00:17:01.876 --> 00:17:03.526 A:middle
accessibility improvements for

00:17:03.526 --> 00:17:05.036 A:middle
free on both platforms.

00:17:06.796 --> 00:17:07.096 A:middle
All right.

00:17:07.766 --> 00:17:08.925 A:middle
So, there's another cool feature

00:17:08.925 --> 00:17:11.406 A:middle
new to 2017, which is PDFPages

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:13.626 A:middle
Method Thumbnail of size for a

00:17:13.626 --> 00:17:14.496 A:middle
display box.

00:17:14.935 --> 00:17:15.925 A:middle
Oftentimes, you might be in a

00:17:15.925 --> 00:17:17.776 A:middle
situation where you have a PDF

00:17:17.776 --> 00:17:19.346 A:middle
document and all you want to do,

00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:20.586 A:middle
nothing more complicated, all

00:17:20.586 --> 00:17:22.006 A:middle
you want to do is just show a

00:17:22.006 --> 00:17:22.856 A:middle
preview of a page.

00:17:23.656 --> 00:17:25.406 A:middle
With this new method, we do all

00:17:25.406 --> 00:17:26.806 A:middle
of that work for you and, again,

00:17:26.806 --> 00:17:28.246 A:middle
we'll respect the P3 color

00:17:28.246 --> 00:17:28.566 A:middle
space.

00:17:28.566 --> 00:17:29.856 A:middle
So, if your document has any

00:17:29.856 --> 00:17:31.466 A:middle
sort of complicated asset that

00:17:31.466 --> 00:17:32.836 A:middle
has a wide gamut color, we'll

00:17:32.836 --> 00:17:34.596 A:middle
make sure that the UI image or

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.066 A:middle
the NS image like gets authored

00:17:36.066 --> 00:17:38.116 A:middle
from this is P3 compliance.

00:17:38.596 --> 00:17:39.456 A:middle
What's also nice, this will

00:17:39.456 --> 00:17:40.886 A:middle
track size to fit the document

00:17:40.886 --> 00:17:42.006 A:middle
in the given bounds while

00:17:42.006 --> 00:17:43.426 A:middle
maintaining aspect ratio.

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:46.146 A:middle
But that last argument display

00:17:46.146 --> 00:17:47.166 A:middle
box, what is that?

00:17:47.536 --> 00:17:49.696 A:middle
So, to explain that enumeration,

00:17:49.746 --> 00:17:51.016 A:middle
I have to kind of explain how

00:17:51.176 --> 00:17:53.256 A:middle
PDF content works in terms of

00:17:53.356 --> 00:17:53.846 A:middle
graphics.

00:17:54.996 --> 00:17:56.576 A:middle
So, we're going to start with

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:57.766 A:middle
the Cartesian Coordinate Space.

00:17:57.836 --> 00:17:59.486 A:middle
This is the content coordinate

00:17:59.486 --> 00:18:01.256 A:middle
space that all PDFPages draw

00:17:59.486 --> 00:18:01.256 A:middle
space that all PDFPages draw

00:18:01.256 --> 00:18:01.676 A:middle
into.

00:18:01.676 --> 00:18:03.406 A:middle
So, you've got origin at 00.

00:18:03.406 --> 00:18:04.956 A:middle
X positive grows to the right.

00:18:05.196 --> 00:18:07.346 A:middle
Y positive grows up, and I'm

00:18:07.346 --> 00:18:08.346 A:middle
going to put a little string,

00:18:08.346 --> 00:18:09.646 A:middle
I'm going to say "Hello, San

00:18:09.646 --> 00:18:10.006 A:middle
Jose."

00:18:10.836 --> 00:18:12.246 A:middle
And with this string, I want to

00:18:12.246 --> 00:18:13.956 A:middle
put it on a page, so it's got a

00:18:13.956 --> 00:18:14.606 A:middle
location.

00:18:14.606 --> 00:18:15.426 A:middle
I'm going to put that on the

00:18:15.426 --> 00:18:16.656 A:middle
page, and the page itself, of

00:18:16.656 --> 00:18:17.556 A:middle
course, has a size.

00:18:17.816 --> 00:18:18.986 A:middle
So, we've got all of these

00:18:18.986 --> 00:18:20.346 A:middle
geometric properties, but

00:18:21.116 --> 00:18:22.836 A:middle
something really bothers me, and

00:18:22.836 --> 00:18:23.966 A:middle
what bothers me is it's not

00:18:24.096 --> 00:18:24.476 A:middle
centered.

00:18:24.696 --> 00:18:27.356 A:middle
Right? So, we could redraw this

00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:28.666 A:middle
entire content, but that's

00:18:28.666 --> 00:18:29.876 A:middle
really unacceptable and

00:18:29.876 --> 00:18:30.366 A:middle
expensive.

00:18:30.366 --> 00:18:32.056 A:middle
No one wants to re-author a PDF

00:18:32.056 --> 00:18:34.236 A:middle
document by re-issuing and

00:18:34.236 --> 00:18:35.866 A:middle
redrawing all of these draw

00:18:35.866 --> 00:18:36.346 A:middle
commands.

00:18:36.876 --> 00:18:37.876 A:middle
So, instead, we're going to take

00:18:37.876 --> 00:18:39.326 A:middle
advantage of the power of PDF

00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:40.376 A:middle
and take advantage of the

00:18:40.376 --> 00:18:41.866 A:middle
enumeration I was talking about.

00:18:42.396 --> 00:18:43.326 A:middle
We're going to take this

00:18:43.326 --> 00:18:45.246 A:middle
PDFPage, and we're going to set

00:18:45.506 --> 00:18:46.926 A:middle
the frame for that specific

00:18:46.926 --> 00:18:48.496 A:middle
display box to be slightly

00:18:48.496 --> 00:18:48.976 A:middle
offset.

00:18:49.276 --> 00:18:50.376 A:middle
It's offset because we want to

00:18:50.376 --> 00:18:51.916 A:middle
keep San Jose dead center.

00:18:52.446 --> 00:18:54.766 A:middle
And I don't really like

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:55.906 A:middle
Landscapes; I want to turn it

00:18:55.906 --> 00:18:57.106 A:middle
into Portrait, and I could do so

00:18:57.106 --> 00:18:58.496 A:middle
again without reissuing any of

00:18:58.496 --> 00:18:59.616 A:middle
my draw commands, I could just

00:18:59.616 --> 00:19:00.906 A:middle
set that frame property.

00:18:59.616 --> 00:19:00.906 A:middle
set that frame property.

00:19:02.436 --> 00:19:04.656 A:middle
Now, why is it that I could

00:19:04.656 --> 00:19:06.666 A:middle
change to use PDFPage Geometric

00:19:06.666 --> 00:19:07.856 A:middle
Properties without changing the

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:08.296 A:middle
content?

00:19:08.296 --> 00:19:09.426 A:middle
What's the real benefit other

00:19:09.426 --> 00:19:10.676 A:middle
than we're just saving some time

00:19:10.676 --> 00:19:11.716 A:middle
when saving the file?

00:19:12.196 --> 00:19:14.236 A:middle
The real benefit is PDF comes

00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:15.816 A:middle
from the physical printing

00:19:15.816 --> 00:19:16.106 A:middle
world.

00:19:16.456 --> 00:19:17.646 A:middle
That means that there are cases

00:19:17.646 --> 00:19:18.766 A:middle
where you actually want to have

00:19:18.806 --> 00:19:20.616 A:middle
multiple PDFPages for the same

00:19:20.616 --> 00:19:21.126 A:middle
content.

00:19:21.956 --> 00:19:23.596 A:middle
You should think about PDFPages

00:19:23.596 --> 00:19:25.486 A:middle
at least when it comes to this

00:19:25.486 --> 00:19:26.126 A:middle
content.

00:19:26.126 --> 00:19:27.036 A:middle
When you're drawing it out, you

00:19:27.036 --> 00:19:28.546 A:middle
should see them as View portals

00:19:28.546 --> 00:19:29.356 A:middle
into your content.

00:19:29.686 --> 00:19:32.186 A:middle
There's one box of content, but

00:19:32.186 --> 00:19:33.246 A:middle
then there could be several view

00:19:33.246 --> 00:19:34.936 A:middle
portals or pages into that

00:19:34.936 --> 00:19:35.406 A:middle
content.

00:19:35.766 --> 00:19:37.126 A:middle
And the reason why we do that

00:19:37.126 --> 00:19:38.826 A:middle
is, take a look at the corners,

00:19:39.526 --> 00:19:39.806 A:middle
right.

00:19:39.946 --> 00:19:41.396 A:middle
In the physical printing world,

00:19:41.466 --> 00:19:42.276 A:middle
when you're trying to print this

00:19:42.276 --> 00:19:43.576 A:middle
professionally, oftentimes,

00:19:43.576 --> 00:19:44.686 A:middle
they're going to print this

00:19:44.846 --> 00:19:46.616 A:middle
through several passes, and each

00:19:46.616 --> 00:19:47.576 A:middle
pass is going to lay on a

00:19:47.616 --> 00:19:48.646 A:middle
separate layer of ink.

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:50.516 A:middle
And to do that perfectly, there

00:19:50.516 --> 00:19:51.426 A:middle
needs to be some sort of

00:19:51.426 --> 00:19:51.776 A:middle
alignment.

00:19:52.216 --> 00:19:53.316 A:middle
So, here, we've authored the

00:19:53.316 --> 00:19:54.756 A:middle
page with optical alignment

00:19:54.756 --> 00:19:56.426 A:middle
characters at each corner so the

00:19:56.526 --> 00:19:57.856 A:middle
physical process can put that

00:19:57.856 --> 00:19:58.886 A:middle
ink perfectly.

00:20:00.226 --> 00:20:01.616 A:middle
And that's why we have these

00:20:01.616 --> 00:20:01.976 A:middle
enumerations.

00:20:02.616 --> 00:20:03.846 A:middle
In this case, I'm showing the

00:20:03.846 --> 00:20:05.026 A:middle
digital version, which is the

00:20:05.026 --> 00:20:05.616 A:middle
Prop Box.

00:20:05.686 --> 00:20:07.196 A:middle
That's what PDFKit defaults to,

00:20:07.556 --> 00:20:08.626 A:middle
and then we're also showing the

00:20:08.766 --> 00:20:09.846 A:middle
physical version, which is what

00:20:09.846 --> 00:20:11.696 A:middle
we'll physically print, via the

00:20:11.696 --> 00:20:12.476 A:middle
media box.

00:20:12.826 --> 00:20:14.106 A:middle
There's three more that you

00:20:14.106 --> 00:20:15.676 A:middle
could play with, and then also

00:20:15.676 --> 00:20:16.746 A:middle
don't forget what's really

00:20:16.746 --> 00:20:18.586 A:middle
powerful about this is any

00:20:18.586 --> 00:20:19.776 A:middle
modifications you make to one

00:20:19.776 --> 00:20:20.736 A:middle
box, because you're modifying

00:20:20.736 --> 00:20:22.036 A:middle
that content, is going to appear

00:20:22.036 --> 00:20:22.866 A:middle
in both Pages.

00:20:23.576 --> 00:20:25.026 A:middle
All right.

00:20:25.466 --> 00:20:27.416 A:middle
So, let's now talk about Custom

00:20:27.416 --> 00:20:28.686 A:middle
PDFPage Drawing.

00:20:28.686 --> 00:20:29.556 A:middle
We've talked about changing

00:20:29.556 --> 00:20:30.606 A:middle
everything else, but what about

00:20:30.606 --> 00:20:31.846 A:middle
actually drawing content?

00:20:32.616 --> 00:20:33.936 A:middle
There are three simple steps.

00:20:34.236 --> 00:20:35.936 A:middle
The first is given a PDF

00:20:35.936 --> 00:20:37.276 A:middle
document; we're going to set a

00:20:37.276 --> 00:20:38.726 A:middle
PDFDocument delegate.

00:20:39.046 --> 00:20:39.856 A:middle
The reason why we set that

00:20:39.856 --> 00:20:42.096 A:middle
delegate is Step 2, that

00:20:42.096 --> 00:20:43.396 A:middle
delegate should implement

00:20:43.396 --> 00:20:44.386 A:middle
classForPage.

00:20:44.386 --> 00:20:46.306 A:middle
We're going to return a subclass

00:20:46.366 --> 00:20:48.016 A:middle
that we've implemented that's

00:20:48.016 --> 00:20:49.476 A:middle
going to define how do we want

00:20:49.476 --> 00:20:50.666 A:middle
to draw this PDFPage.

00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:52.046 A:middle
So, in this case, I'm going to

00:20:52.046 --> 00:20:53.956 A:middle
say please draw with my custom

00:20:53.956 --> 00:20:55.756 A:middle
subclass called WatermarkPage.

00:20:56.576 --> 00:20:58.516 A:middle
Third step, third and final, is

00:20:58.516 --> 00:20:59.846 A:middle
we need to actually override

00:20:59.846 --> 00:21:01.766 A:middle
that PDFPage subclass' draw

00:20:59.846 --> 00:21:01.766 A:middle
that PDFPage subclass' draw

00:21:01.766 --> 00:21:02.136 A:middle
method.

00:21:02.406 --> 00:21:03.426 A:middle
So, we're going to do draw with

00:21:03.466 --> 00:21:05.136 A:middle
box to context.

00:21:05.496 --> 00:21:07.276 A:middle
Let me show you a full example

00:21:07.376 --> 00:21:08.330 A:middle
and end.

00:21:15.456 --> 00:21:16.000 A:middle
Perfect.

00:21:18.796 --> 00:21:18.946 A:middle
All right.

00:21:19.126 --> 00:21:21.746 A:middle
So, here I've got iOS simulator

00:21:21.746 --> 00:21:23.076 A:middle
running a sample application

00:21:23.076 --> 00:21:24.526 A:middle
that implements my three rules,

00:21:25.106 --> 00:21:26.636 A:middle
and in this application, I just

00:21:26.636 --> 00:21:27.676 A:middle
get to scroll around just like a

00:21:27.676 --> 00:21:30.236 A:middle
normal PDFView, but I want

00:21:30.236 --> 00:21:31.076 A:middle
something different in this

00:21:31.076 --> 00:21:31.646 A:middle
application.

00:21:31.776 --> 00:21:33.106 A:middle
I want to say that we're

00:21:33.106 --> 00:21:34.186 A:middle
handling really sensitive

00:21:34.186 --> 00:21:35.816 A:middle
documents, and every time one of

00:21:35.816 --> 00:21:37.506 A:middle
my users opens these documents,

00:21:37.926 --> 00:21:38.746 A:middle
we have to track them.

00:21:38.776 --> 00:21:40.926 A:middle
We have to know that user X has

00:21:40.926 --> 00:21:43.106 A:middle
seen this content, and if user X

00:21:43.106 --> 00:21:44.776 A:middle
leaks this content, right, we'll

00:21:44.776 --> 00:21:45.776 A:middle
know exactly who did it.

00:21:46.086 --> 00:21:47.596 A:middle
So, our goal is to draw some

00:21:47.596 --> 00:21:49.426 A:middle
custom identifier atop every

00:21:49.426 --> 00:21:51.316 A:middle
single page, and we could do so

00:21:51.316 --> 00:21:52.386 A:middle
with those three steps.

00:21:52.456 --> 00:21:54.406 A:middle
So, the very first step, if we

00:21:54.406 --> 00:21:55.806 A:middle
go to our ViewController,

00:21:56.386 --> 00:21:57.266 A:middle
there's a little bit of overhead

00:21:57.266 --> 00:21:58.686 A:middle
to set up the PDFView, but

00:21:58.806 --> 00:21:59.836 A:middle
here's the core step.

00:22:00.276 --> 00:22:01.446 A:middle
We are setting the delegate to

00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:02.016 A:middle
ourselves.

00:22:02.016 --> 00:22:03.156 A:middle
We are setting the delegate to

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:03.946 A:middle
the ViewController.

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:05.736 A:middle
The reason why we do that, Step

00:22:05.736 --> 00:22:07.496 A:middle
2, we're going to declare, like

00:22:07.496 --> 00:22:08.776 A:middle
you saw previously in the sides,

00:22:08.776 --> 00:22:09.666 A:middle
we're going to declare that

00:22:09.666 --> 00:22:11.256 A:middle
watermarkPage as this PDFPage

00:22:11.306 --> 00:22:13.026 A:middle
subclass, and we want to return

00:22:13.026 --> 00:22:14.196 A:middle
that as our customDrawer.

00:22:15.096 --> 00:22:18.006 A:middle
The final step, Step 3, is we're

00:22:18.006 --> 00:22:20.076 A:middle
now overriding the Draw

00:22:20.076 --> 00:22:21.326 A:middle
Function, draw with Box 2

00:22:21.326 --> 00:22:22.836 A:middle
context, and we're putting all

00:22:22.836 --> 00:22:24.166 A:middle
of our custom graphics inside.

00:22:24.996 --> 00:22:26.496 A:middle
So, before coming to stage

00:22:26.496 --> 00:22:27.666 A:middle
today, I commented out

00:22:27.666 --> 00:22:28.586 A:middle
everything just to see what it

00:22:28.586 --> 00:22:30.456 A:middle
would look like before.

00:22:30.456 --> 00:22:31.636 A:middle
And well, let me show you what

00:22:31.636 --> 00:22:32.406 A:middle
it looks like after.

00:22:33.196 --> 00:22:34.656 A:middle
So, in the code, I first call

00:22:34.656 --> 00:22:36.506 A:middle
Draw super, and then I draw my

00:22:36.506 --> 00:22:37.836 A:middle
custom graphics, and there's a

00:22:37.836 --> 00:22:38.626 A:middle
reason why I do that.

00:22:39.446 --> 00:22:40.736 A:middle
So, when I execute the code with

00:22:40.736 --> 00:22:42.376 A:middle
that modification, all pages

00:22:42.376 --> 00:22:44.136 A:middle
have this graphical content

00:22:44.136 --> 00:22:44.476 A:middle
added.

00:22:44.736 --> 00:22:45.836 A:middle
And what's really nice about

00:22:45.836 --> 00:22:47.386 A:middle
this is if I attempt to save the

00:22:47.386 --> 00:22:48.896 A:middle
document or print it, it's

00:22:48.896 --> 00:22:50.156 A:middle
guaranteed to have that custom

00:22:50.156 --> 00:22:51.626 A:middle
graphics that I've just put in.

00:22:52.386 --> 00:22:53.306 A:middle
But I wanted to mention again,

00:22:53.436 --> 00:22:55.636 A:middle
order is critical because we

00:22:55.636 --> 00:22:57.136 A:middle
respect the painter's algorithm.

00:22:57.136 --> 00:22:58.836 A:middle
What that means is whatever you

00:22:58.836 --> 00:22:59.906 A:middle
draw first, if you draw the

00:22:59.906 --> 00:23:01.506 A:middle
original content, followed by

00:22:59.906 --> 00:23:01.506 A:middle
original content, followed by

00:23:01.506 --> 00:23:02.836 A:middle
drawing your custom content,

00:23:03.096 --> 00:23:04.336 A:middle
your custom content will appear

00:23:04.336 --> 00:23:04.696 A:middle
above.

00:23:05.296 --> 00:23:06.596 A:middle
If you flip that, if you draw

00:23:06.596 --> 00:23:08.116 A:middle
your custom content and then you

00:23:08.116 --> 00:23:09.906 A:middle
draw super, right, the original

00:23:09.906 --> 00:23:11.146 A:middle
content will be above.

00:23:11.606 --> 00:23:12.846 A:middle
So, just keep that in mind when

00:23:12.846 --> 00:23:13.766 A:middle
you're vieing custom drawing.

00:23:13.766 --> 00:23:13.976 A:middle
All right.

00:23:17.316 --> 00:23:19.596 A:middle
So, we have talked a lot about

00:23:19.596 --> 00:23:22.596 A:middle
PDFView, PDFDocument, PDFPage; I

00:23:22.596 --> 00:23:23.646 A:middle
think it's time we talk about

00:23:23.806 --> 00:23:24.486 A:middle
Annotations.

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:25.076 A:middle
Nicki.

00:23:25.706 --> 00:23:26.500 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right, perfect.

00:23:27.516 --> 00:23:31.396 A:middle
[ Audience Applause ]

00:23:31.896 --> 00:23:32.316 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:23:32.316 --> 00:23:33.736 A:middle
Let's talk about my favorite

00:23:33.776 --> 00:23:35.086 A:middle
thing, Annotations.

00:23:35.156 --> 00:23:36.996 A:middle
First off, we keep saying this

00:23:36.996 --> 00:23:38.096 A:middle
word Annotations a lot.

00:23:38.096 --> 00:23:38.736 A:middle
What are these?

00:23:39.226 --> 00:23:40.456 A:middle
Well, these are interactive

00:23:40.456 --> 00:23:41.776 A:middle
graphical elements that we can

00:23:41.876 --> 00:23:42.966 A:middle
add to a PDF document.

00:23:43.806 --> 00:23:45.216 A:middle
These are things as simple as a

00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:47.676 A:middle
line or a square, but there's a

00:23:47.676 --> 00:23:48.906 A:middle
handful of other annotations as

00:23:48.906 --> 00:23:51.036 A:middle
well, like highlight, underline,

00:23:51.436 --> 00:23:53.346 A:middle
circles, links, and even

00:23:53.346 --> 00:23:54.656 A:middle
widgets, which are interactive

00:23:54.656 --> 00:23:55.386 A:middle
form elements.

00:23:56.076 --> 00:23:58.386 A:middle
We mentioned earlier that

00:23:58.386 --> 00:23:59.616 A:middle
Annotations are owned by

00:23:59.616 --> 00:24:00.396 A:middle
PDFPage.

00:23:59.616 --> 00:24:00.396 A:middle
PDFPage.

00:24:00.876 --> 00:24:01.936 A:middle
So, whenever you create an

00:24:01.936 --> 00:24:03.816 A:middle
Annotation, you add or remove it

00:24:03.816 --> 00:24:05.146 A:middle
to and from a PDFPage.

00:24:05.456 --> 00:24:06.846 A:middle
And then, if your page is in a

00:24:06.846 --> 00:24:08.696 A:middle
PDFView, whenever you update

00:24:08.696 --> 00:24:10.006 A:middle
properties on that Annotation,

00:24:10.236 --> 00:24:11.696 A:middle
we will update it for you in

00:24:11.696 --> 00:24:12.856 A:middle
real time in the View.

00:24:14.086 --> 00:24:15.726 A:middle
What's fairly new to PDFKit is

00:24:15.726 --> 00:24:16.986 A:middle
our universal Annotation

00:24:16.986 --> 00:24:17.366 A:middle
support.

00:24:17.546 --> 00:24:18.616 A:middle
Okay. What is this?

00:24:19.226 --> 00:24:20.446 A:middle
Well, all those annotations that

00:24:20.446 --> 00:24:22.126 A:middle
I just showed you, those are the

00:24:22.126 --> 00:24:24.256 A:middle
ones that PDFKit supports, and

00:24:24.256 --> 00:24:25.486 A:middle
when I say that, I mean, we have

00:24:25.486 --> 00:24:26.946 A:middle
our own native rendering for

00:24:26.946 --> 00:24:27.956 A:middle
those annotation types.

00:24:28.046 --> 00:24:29.276 A:middle
But that doesn't mean you're

00:24:29.276 --> 00:24:31.006 A:middle
limited to only creating those

00:24:31.006 --> 00:24:32.006 A:middle
types of annotations.

00:24:32.536 --> 00:24:33.716 A:middle
With our universal support, you

00:24:33.716 --> 00:24:34.926 A:middle
can create whatever you want

00:24:35.256 --> 00:24:36.966 A:middle
because, well, the PDF spec

00:24:37.466 --> 00:24:39.366 A:middle
defines an annotation as just a

00:24:39.366 --> 00:24:40.766 A:middle
dictionary of keys and values.

00:24:40.826 --> 00:24:42.256 A:middle
So, we've gone ahead and

00:24:42.256 --> 00:24:44.006 A:middle
mimicked that within PDFKit.

00:24:44.396 --> 00:24:46.466 A:middle
For example, the PDF spec can

00:24:46.466 --> 00:24:47.746 A:middle
have extensions to it that

00:24:47.746 --> 00:24:49.336 A:middle
defines all sorts of annotations

00:24:49.336 --> 00:24:50.196 A:middle
we've never seen before.

00:24:50.896 --> 00:24:52.256 A:middle
Take the GPS Annotation.

00:24:52.516 --> 00:24:53.766 A:middle
This can have certain

00:24:53.766 --> 00:24:54.936 A:middle
properties, coordinates,

00:24:54.936 --> 00:24:56.806 A:middle
latitude, longitude, and with

00:24:56.806 --> 00:24:58.196 A:middle
their universal support, we can

00:24:58.196 --> 00:24:59.976 A:middle
go ahead and set those values on

00:24:59.976 --> 00:25:01.786 A:middle
our dictionary, and then what

00:24:59.976 --> 00:25:01.786 A:middle
our dictionary, and then what

00:25:01.786 --> 00:25:02.656 A:middle
you see is what you get.

00:25:03.266 --> 00:25:04.546 A:middle
Whatever you set, we'll go ahead

00:25:04.546 --> 00:25:05.886 A:middle
and author that into the file

00:25:05.886 --> 00:25:06.756 A:middle
whenever you write it out.

00:25:06.866 --> 00:25:08.906 A:middle
Even though the PDFKit might be

00:25:08.906 --> 00:25:10.436 A:middle
undefined, you'll still be able

00:25:10.436 --> 00:25:11.356 A:middle
to save it as part of the

00:25:11.356 --> 00:25:12.106 A:middle
PDFDocument.

00:25:12.516 --> 00:25:14.926 A:middle
What's new this year is we've

00:25:14.926 --> 00:25:16.426 A:middle
added an extension to this

00:25:16.426 --> 00:25:18.206 A:middle
class, which is PDFAnnotation

00:25:18.206 --> 00:25:18.766 A:middle
utilities.

00:25:19.346 --> 00:25:20.866 A:middle
This has a handful of category

00:25:20.866 --> 00:25:22.176 A:middle
methods that make it just that

00:25:22.176 --> 00:25:24.056 A:middle
much easier to be able to set

00:25:24.056 --> 00:25:25.856 A:middle
and get the properties for

00:25:25.856 --> 00:25:27.496 A:middle
annotations that we do support

00:25:27.626 --> 00:25:28.856 A:middle
or just properties that are

00:25:28.856 --> 00:25:30.086 A:middle
common amongst the annotations

00:25:30.086 --> 00:25:32.006 A:middle
in general, like a color or a

00:25:32.006 --> 00:25:32.376 A:middle
border.

00:25:32.866 --> 00:25:34.636 A:middle
We'll take a look at our

00:25:34.636 --> 00:25:35.966 A:middle
annotations again, but let's

00:25:35.966 --> 00:25:37.816 A:middle
just focus in on one, a line

00:25:37.816 --> 00:25:38.426 A:middle
annotation.

00:25:39.456 --> 00:25:40.916 A:middle
We all know that annotations are

00:25:40.916 --> 00:25:42.456 A:middle
just a bunch of properties, so

00:25:42.456 --> 00:25:43.196 A:middle
whenever I change the

00:25:43.196 --> 00:25:45.136 A:middle
properties, here all I've done

00:25:45.136 --> 00:25:46.576 A:middle
are change my line ending styles

00:25:46.576 --> 00:25:47.506 A:middle
and my border.

00:25:47.806 --> 00:25:48.816 A:middle
We can make a simple line

00:25:48.816 --> 00:25:50.086 A:middle
annotation look different six

00:25:50.086 --> 00:25:50.336 A:middle
ways.

00:25:51.326 --> 00:25:52.306 A:middle
So, let's take a look at how we

00:25:52.306 --> 00:25:53.456 A:middle
actually set those properties.

00:25:54.416 --> 00:25:55.686 A:middle
So, a line, it needs a start and

00:25:55.686 --> 00:25:57.296 A:middle
end point, so we'll set that on

00:25:57.296 --> 00:25:58.686 A:middle
our dictionary using SetValue

00:25:58.686 --> 00:26:00.606 A:middle
forAnnotationKey with our

00:25:58.686 --> 00:26:00.606 A:middle
forAnnotationKey with our

00:26:00.606 --> 00:26:01.356 A:middle
linePointsKey.

00:26:02.566 --> 00:26:03.826 A:middle
We'll set the line ending styles

00:26:03.826 --> 00:26:05.306 A:middle
and want a closed arrow on one

00:26:05.306 --> 00:26:06.316 A:middle
end and an open arrow on the

00:26:06.316 --> 00:26:08.176 A:middle
other, and then we'll change the

00:26:08.176 --> 00:26:08.526 A:middle
color.

00:26:08.886 --> 00:26:09.936 A:middle
We'll change it to red.

00:26:10.546 --> 00:26:12.036 A:middle
But remember those category

00:26:12.036 --> 00:26:13.386 A:middle
methods I just talked about,

00:26:13.386 --> 00:26:14.426 A:middle
let's go ahead and use those to

00:26:14.426 --> 00:26:15.606 A:middle
do the same exact thing.

00:26:16.766 --> 00:26:17.116 A:middle
Here we go.

00:26:17.116 --> 00:26:18.416 A:middle
We're still setting the start

00:26:18.416 --> 00:26:19.486 A:middle
and end point, the line ending

00:26:19.536 --> 00:26:20.466 A:middle
styles, and the color.

00:26:20.466 --> 00:26:22.486 A:middle
And when we compare the two,

00:26:22.806 --> 00:26:24.186 A:middle
sure, the category methods might

00:26:24.186 --> 00:26:25.416 A:middle
be a few extra lines of code,

00:26:25.416 --> 00:26:26.746 A:middle
but it's very clear as to what

00:26:26.746 --> 00:26:27.246 A:middle
we're doing.

00:26:27.296 --> 00:26:28.836 A:middle
When we're setting values on the

00:26:28.836 --> 00:26:30.606 A:middle
dictionary, we're mimicking the

00:26:30.606 --> 00:26:31.906 A:middle
spec, and the spec can be a

00:26:31.906 --> 00:26:32.746 A:middle
little confusing.

00:26:32.746 --> 00:26:34.836 A:middle
To set an array of numbers or

00:26:34.836 --> 00:26:36.236 A:middle
array of strings for our line

00:26:36.236 --> 00:26:37.386 A:middle
points and line ending styles,

00:26:38.286 --> 00:26:39.996 A:middle
that's just, again, confusing.

00:26:40.456 --> 00:26:41.606 A:middle
With the category methods, it's

00:26:41.606 --> 00:26:42.806 A:middle
explicit that you're setting the

00:26:42.806 --> 00:26:44.526 A:middle
start point, the end point, the

00:26:44.526 --> 00:26:45.806 A:middle
start and line style, and the

00:26:45.806 --> 00:26:46.066 A:middle
color.

00:26:46.596 --> 00:26:48.606 A:middle
Just makes life a little bit

00:26:49.356 --> 00:26:49.506 A:middle
easier.

00:26:49.616 --> 00:26:50.756 A:middle
Okay. Let's create an

00:26:50.756 --> 00:26:51.386 A:middle
Annotation.

00:26:51.516 --> 00:26:53.156 A:middle
Our [inaudible] method takes

00:26:53.186 --> 00:26:55.086 A:middle
three properties, bounds, type,

00:26:55.086 --> 00:26:56.156 A:middle
and the dictionary properties.

00:26:56.636 --> 00:26:58.256 A:middle
Only two of these are required;

00:26:58.556 --> 00:26:59.746 A:middle
abounds, we need to know where

00:26:59.746 --> 00:27:00.746 A:middle
it's supposed to be in the page,

00:26:59.746 --> 00:27:00.746 A:middle
it's supposed to be in the page,

00:27:01.136 --> 00:27:01.936 A:middle
and then a type.

00:27:02.276 --> 00:27:03.426 A:middle
For here, we're going to create

00:27:03.426 --> 00:27:04.306 A:middle
a square annotation.

00:27:05.026 --> 00:27:06.346 A:middle
The properties parameter, we're

00:27:06.346 --> 00:27:07.396 A:middle
going to leave no for now, but

00:27:07.396 --> 00:27:10.176 A:middle
I'll get to that in a second.

00:27:10.286 --> 00:27:11.886 A:middle
Okay. Let's set some properties.

00:27:11.886 --> 00:27:12.906 A:middle
We'll set the color on it.

00:27:12.906 --> 00:27:13.936 A:middle
We already know how to do that.

00:27:14.376 --> 00:27:15.476 A:middle
But we'll set the border as

00:27:15.476 --> 00:27:17.016 A:middle
well, and I want to touch on

00:27:17.016 --> 00:27:19.356 A:middle
this PDFBorder object for just a

00:27:19.486 --> 00:27:19.706 A:middle
second.

00:27:19.926 --> 00:27:21.486 A:middle
The annotation dictionary is

00:27:21.486 --> 00:27:23.316 A:middle
just a dictionary of keys and

00:27:23.316 --> 00:27:24.916 A:middle
values, but some of its values

00:27:24.946 --> 00:27:26.696 A:middle
can also be dictionaries, and so

00:27:26.696 --> 00:27:28.036 A:middle
you don't have to go and pull up

00:27:28.036 --> 00:27:29.146 A:middle
the spec and figure out how

00:27:29.146 --> 00:27:30.086 A:middle
you're supposed to construct

00:27:30.086 --> 00:27:31.446 A:middle
this border dictionary value.

00:27:31.706 --> 00:27:32.866 A:middle
We've already created a support

00:27:32.866 --> 00:27:34.036 A:middle
class for you, and that's

00:27:34.086 --> 00:27:34.746 A:middle
PDFBorder.

00:27:35.576 --> 00:27:37.556 A:middle
We'll set the line width, set to

00:27:37.556 --> 00:27:39.056 A:middle
our annotation border property,

00:27:39.146 --> 00:27:40.536 A:middle
and then when we add it to the

00:27:40.536 --> 00:27:41.316 A:middle
page, it looks a little

00:27:41.316 --> 00:27:42.006 A:middle
something like this.

00:27:42.346 --> 00:27:43.386 A:middle
Just have a simple square,

00:27:43.736 --> 00:27:45.126 A:middle
bottom left corner of our page,

00:27:45.126 --> 00:27:45.756 A:middle
and it's red.

00:27:46.316 --> 00:27:48.806 A:middle
Let's take a look at that

00:27:48.806 --> 00:27:50.266 A:middle
properties parameter though.

00:27:50.266 --> 00:27:51.466 A:middle
So, what we can do is we can

00:27:51.466 --> 00:27:53.156 A:middle
kind of prebake a dictionary to

00:27:53.156 --> 00:27:53.706 A:middle
properties.

00:27:54.216 --> 00:27:55.046 A:middle
We're going to create a line

00:27:55.046 --> 00:27:56.556 A:middle
annotation again, and we already

00:27:56.556 --> 00:27:57.856 A:middle
know it takes line points, line

00:27:57.856 --> 00:27:59.626 A:middle
ending styles, color, and now

00:27:59.626 --> 00:28:00.036 A:middle
border.

00:27:59.626 --> 00:28:00.036 A:middle
border.

00:28:00.656 --> 00:28:01.546 A:middle
So, then, when we [inaudible]

00:28:01.546 --> 00:28:03.786 A:middle
our annotation, we will, instead

00:28:03.786 --> 00:28:05.216 A:middle
of using nil for our properties

00:28:05.216 --> 00:28:06.406 A:middle
parameter use our line

00:28:06.406 --> 00:28:07.316 A:middle
attributes dictionary.

00:28:08.036 --> 00:28:09.136 A:middle
So, when we add it to the page,

00:28:09.136 --> 00:28:09.926 A:middle
it looks a little something like

00:28:09.926 --> 00:28:10.196 A:middle
this.

00:28:10.806 --> 00:28:12.286 A:middle
It has a line starting at the

00:28:12.286 --> 00:28:14.046 A:middle
origin, going up, and to the

00:28:14.046 --> 00:28:15.986 A:middle
right, has a closed arrow on one

00:28:15.986 --> 00:28:17.296 A:middle
end, and the color is red.

00:28:17.426 --> 00:28:21.026 A:middle
I want to touch on this one

00:28:21.026 --> 00:28:22.276 A:middle
property that annotations has

00:28:22.276 --> 00:28:23.266 A:middle
which is really powerful.

00:28:23.516 --> 00:28:24.486 A:middle
It's Action property.

00:28:24.736 --> 00:28:26.496 A:middle
Just like PDFBorder was a

00:28:26.496 --> 00:28:28.246 A:middle
wrapper for a dictionary, so is

00:28:28.246 --> 00:28:30.366 A:middle
PDFAction, so you can do things

00:28:30.366 --> 00:28:32.416 A:middle
such as jumping to a URL, and

00:28:32.416 --> 00:28:34.306 A:middle
here we create URL, use that to

00:28:34.306 --> 00:28:36.026 A:middle
create a PDFAction URL object,

00:28:36.146 --> 00:28:37.256 A:middle
and then set it on our

00:28:37.256 --> 00:28:37.956 A:middle
Annotation.

00:28:38.156 --> 00:28:39.196 A:middle
For here, it's going to be a

00:28:39.196 --> 00:28:40.036 A:middle
Link Annotation.

00:28:40.596 --> 00:28:42.116 A:middle
But we can also do things such

00:28:42.116 --> 00:28:43.426 A:middle
as jumping to a specific point

00:28:43.426 --> 00:28:43.986 A:middle
in a document.

00:28:44.596 --> 00:28:46.116 A:middle
We can do that by creating a

00:28:46.116 --> 00:28:47.276 A:middle
PDFDestination object with the

00:28:47.276 --> 00:28:49.196 A:middle
page and a point, using that to

00:28:49.196 --> 00:28:50.926 A:middle
create our PDFAction go to

00:28:50.926 --> 00:28:53.076 A:middle
action, and then, again, set our

00:28:53.076 --> 00:28:53.746 A:middle
Action property.

00:28:54.456 --> 00:28:57.176 A:middle
Okay. Let's talk about widgets.

00:28:57.936 --> 00:28:59.206 A:middle
Widgets are, again, our

00:28:59.206 --> 00:29:00.806 A:middle
interactive form elements, but

00:28:59.206 --> 00:29:00.806 A:middle
interactive form elements, but

00:29:00.806 --> 00:29:02.006 A:middle
these are a little confusing how

00:29:02.006 --> 00:29:03.236 A:middle
to create, so I want to break it

00:29:03.236 --> 00:29:03.936 A:middle
down for you guys.

00:29:04.026 --> 00:29:05.886 A:middle
We have very different flavors

00:29:05.886 --> 00:29:06.346 A:middle
of widgets.

00:29:06.426 --> 00:29:08.696 A:middle
These are text widgets, buttons,

00:29:08.696 --> 00:29:09.496 A:middle
and choice widgets.

00:29:09.966 --> 00:29:11.776 A:middle
And so PDFKit knows what type of

00:29:11.776 --> 00:29:13.036 A:middle
widget and interactive element

00:29:13.036 --> 00:29:14.276 A:middle
to add to your PDFDocument.

00:29:14.616 --> 00:29:15.476 A:middle
You need to let us know.

00:29:15.846 --> 00:29:17.056 A:middle
And this is driven by our widget

00:29:17.056 --> 00:29:18.616 A:middle
field type property to be either

00:29:18.616 --> 00:29:19.766 A:middle
a text button or choice.

00:29:21.536 --> 00:29:22.626 A:middle
Even further, some of our

00:29:22.626 --> 00:29:24.036 A:middle
subtypes have more flavors.

00:29:24.526 --> 00:29:25.816 A:middle
Like a button, we can have a

00:29:25.816 --> 00:29:27.616 A:middle
radio button, a check box, or a

00:29:27.616 --> 00:29:29.116 A:middle
push button, and this is driven

00:29:29.116 --> 00:29:30.346 A:middle
by our widget control type

00:29:30.346 --> 00:29:30.776 A:middle
property.

00:29:32.196 --> 00:29:33.666 A:middle
And same with width or choice

00:29:33.666 --> 00:29:34.066 A:middle
widgets.

00:29:34.556 --> 00:29:36.176 A:middle
We have a list box, which is

00:29:36.176 --> 00:29:38.176 A:middle
like a TableView, or a combo

00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:39.386 A:middle
box, which is like a dropdown,

00:29:39.526 --> 00:29:40.966 A:middle
and this is driven by our

00:29:40.966 --> 00:29:42.026 A:middle
isListChoice property.

00:29:42.486 --> 00:29:44.036 A:middle
By default, it's going to be a

00:29:44.306 --> 00:29:45.886 A:middle
list box, but I want to let you

00:29:45.886 --> 00:29:46.656 A:middle
know that there are two

00:29:46.656 --> 00:29:47.216 A:middle
different types.

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:50.176 A:middle
Let's go ahead and create a

00:29:50.176 --> 00:29:50.416 A:middle
widget.

00:29:50.416 --> 00:29:51.686 A:middle
We're going to create a text

00:29:51.686 --> 00:29:52.016 A:middle
widget.

00:29:52.686 --> 00:29:54.236 A:middle
So, our subtype is going to be

00:29:54.576 --> 00:29:56.326 A:middle
widget, but then when we start

00:29:56.326 --> 00:29:57.366 A:middle
our properties, we know that we

00:29:57.366 --> 00:29:58.286 A:middle
have to set the widget field

00:29:58.286 --> 00:29:59.156 A:middle
type, and we're going to set it

00:29:59.156 --> 00:29:59.646 A:middle
to be text.

00:29:59.746 --> 00:30:00.636 A:middle
Then, we'll set a few other

00:29:59.746 --> 00:30:00.636 A:middle
Then, we'll set a few other

00:30:00.636 --> 00:30:00.976 A:middle
properties.

00:30:01.376 --> 00:30:03.146 A:middle
We have our background color,

00:30:03.376 --> 00:30:05.246 A:middle
font, and a string value, and

00:30:05.246 --> 00:30:06.606 A:middle
then when we add it to a page,

00:30:06.606 --> 00:30:07.736 A:middle
it'll look a little something

00:30:07.736 --> 00:30:08.026 A:middle
like this.

00:30:08.026 --> 00:30:10.076 A:middle
We have our text widget about

00:30:10.076 --> 00:30:11.366 A:middle
the middle of the page, the blue

00:30:11.366 --> 00:30:13.136 A:middle
background, and our string,

00:30:13.176 --> 00:30:15.016 A:middle
WWDC2017.

00:30:15.656 --> 00:30:16.746 A:middle
And if this was in a View,

00:30:16.746 --> 00:30:17.796 A:middle
whenever I tapped on it or

00:30:17.796 --> 00:30:19.056 A:middle
clicked on it, it would be fully

00:30:19.056 --> 00:30:19.596 A:middle
interactive.

00:30:22.066 --> 00:30:23.836 A:middle
Okay. Let's take a look at a

00:30:23.876 --> 00:30:26.016 A:middle
real world example using

00:30:26.016 --> 00:30:26.416 A:middle
widgets.

00:30:27.226 --> 00:30:28.656 A:middle
So, I've already gone ahead and

00:30:28.766 --> 00:30:30.966 A:middle
taken a PDF, which is going to

00:30:30.966 --> 00:30:32.266 A:middle
be a survey, and I've added some

00:30:32.266 --> 00:30:33.626 A:middle
interactive form elements to it.

00:30:34.156 --> 00:30:35.786 A:middle
Let's take a look at what this

00:30:35.786 --> 00:30:36.186 A:middle
looks like.

00:30:36.976 --> 00:30:37.686 A:middle
So, here it is.

00:30:37.686 --> 00:30:39.856 A:middle
I have text fields, which have

00:30:39.916 --> 00:30:41.876 A:middle
the blue backgrounds, and then

00:30:42.106 --> 00:30:43.476 A:middle
buttons, which have my gray

00:30:43.476 --> 00:30:45.146 A:middle
backgrounds, and since we're all

00:30:45.146 --> 00:30:46.796 A:middle
widget wizards, we all know that

00:30:46.796 --> 00:30:48.346 A:middle
our text fields will have widget

00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:50.146 A:middle
field type text; buttons will

00:30:50.146 --> 00:30:51.266 A:middle
have widget field type button,

00:30:51.526 --> 00:30:53.176 A:middle
and then even further, our

00:30:53.176 --> 00:30:54.416 A:middle
buttons will have the proper

00:30:54.416 --> 00:30:56.826 A:middle
widget control type set.

00:30:57.376 --> 00:30:58.446 A:middle
So, we have our radio buttons,

00:30:58.746 --> 00:31:00.976 A:middle
our check boxes, and then a push

00:30:58.746 --> 00:31:00.976 A:middle
our check boxes, and then a push

00:31:00.976 --> 00:31:01.896 A:middle
button down here, which is

00:31:01.896 --> 00:31:03.426 A:middle
supposed to reset my entire

00:31:03.426 --> 00:31:03.726 A:middle
form.

00:31:04.206 --> 00:31:05.546 A:middle
There are some things though

00:31:05.546 --> 00:31:06.776 A:middle
that aren't really working right

00:31:06.876 --> 00:31:07.496 A:middle
with this PDF.

00:31:07.646 --> 00:31:09.426 A:middle
For example, when I go to enter

00:31:09.426 --> 00:31:12.686 A:middle
my date, which is June 9, you

00:31:12.686 --> 00:31:13.456 A:middle
can see, it doesn't have the

00:31:13.456 --> 00:31:14.726 A:middle
spacing as I would expect.

00:31:15.186 --> 00:31:16.256 A:middle
And also, I can enter more

00:31:16.256 --> 00:31:18.066 A:middle
characters than what the PDF

00:31:18.116 --> 00:31:19.236 A:middle
says that I should be able to

00:31:19.236 --> 00:31:19.526 A:middle
enter.

00:31:19.906 --> 00:31:20.996 A:middle
That's not right.

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:22.596 A:middle
Also, when I select my radio

00:31:22.596 --> 00:31:24.396 A:middle
buttons, I can select both at

00:31:24.396 --> 00:31:25.056 A:middle
the same time.

00:31:25.056 --> 00:31:26.126 A:middle
That's not really how radio

00:31:26.126 --> 00:31:27.146 A:middle
buttons are supposed to behave.

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:29.546 A:middle
And finally, my button at the

00:31:29.546 --> 00:31:31.366 A:middle
very bottom, when I click it, it

00:31:31.366 --> 00:31:32.436 A:middle
does nothing.

00:31:32.886 --> 00:31:33.936 A:middle
Well, let's go ahead and change

00:31:33.936 --> 00:31:35.896 A:middle
all of that.

00:31:36.066 --> 00:31:37.466 A:middle
Let's go to our date field.

00:31:37.506 --> 00:31:38.766 A:middle
So, remember the things that

00:31:38.766 --> 00:31:39.186 A:middle
were wrong.

00:31:39.186 --> 00:31:40.346 A:middle
It was the spacing and the

00:31:40.346 --> 00:31:41.496 A:middle
number of characters that we can

00:31:41.496 --> 00:31:41.786 A:middle
enter.

00:31:42.026 --> 00:31:43.276 A:middle
Well, we'll start with the easy

00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:44.416 A:middle
one, and that's the number of

00:31:44.416 --> 00:31:44.966 A:middle
characters.

00:31:45.586 --> 00:31:47.246 A:middle
This is driven by our maximum

00:31:47.246 --> 00:31:47.876 A:middle
length property.

00:31:48.046 --> 00:31:49.936 A:middle
So, we'll set it to 5, 2 for the

00:31:49.936 --> 00:31:51.696 A:middle
month, 1 for the slash and 1 for

00:31:51.696 --> 00:31:51.976 A:middle
the day.

00:31:51.976 --> 00:31:53.526 A:middle
So, now, the spacing.

00:31:53.526 --> 00:31:55.116 A:middle
That seems a little hard to do.

00:31:55.646 --> 00:31:56.916 A:middle
But actually, with PDFKit, it

00:31:56.916 --> 00:31:57.516 A:middle
really isn't.

00:31:57.886 --> 00:31:58.946 A:middle
All it is is a property that we

00:31:58.946 --> 00:32:00.366 A:middle
have to set, which is our

00:31:58.946 --> 00:32:00.366 A:middle
have to set, which is our

00:32:00.366 --> 00:32:01.566 A:middle
hasComb property.

00:32:02.436 --> 00:32:04.136 A:middle
So, this property, what it does

00:32:04.136 --> 00:32:06.096 A:middle
is if it's set, it will divide

00:32:06.096 --> 00:32:07.656 A:middle
our text widget into an equal

00:32:07.656 --> 00:32:10.076 A:middle
number of partitions or combs to

00:32:10.206 --> 00:32:11.426 A:middle
the number that is set on our

00:32:11.426 --> 00:32:12.346 A:middle
maximum length field.

00:32:12.576 --> 00:32:14.906 A:middle
So, this property only works in

00:32:14.996 --> 00:32:16.676 A:middle
conjunction with maximum length.

00:32:17.116 --> 00:32:17.446 A:middle
All right.

00:32:17.536 --> 00:32:18.216 A:middle
That's one's done.

00:32:18.286 --> 00:32:19.416 A:middle
On to our radio buttons.

00:32:20.746 --> 00:32:22.206 A:middle
The issue here is that they

00:32:22.206 --> 00:32:23.336 A:middle
weren't behaving like radio

00:32:23.336 --> 00:32:23.706 A:middle
buttons.

00:32:25.056 --> 00:32:26.806 A:middle
So, all our widgets, they

00:32:26.806 --> 00:32:27.916 A:middle
already have their own

00:32:27.916 --> 00:32:29.296 A:middle
identifier, and this is driven

00:32:29.296 --> 00:32:30.756 A:middle
by our field name property.

00:32:31.246 --> 00:32:32.426 A:middle
So, if you want to group widgets

00:32:32.426 --> 00:32:33.786 A:middle
together, they need to have the

00:32:33.786 --> 00:32:34.596 A:middle
same field name.

00:32:35.046 --> 00:32:37.266 A:middle
Let's do that.

00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:38.636 A:middle
We'll have our yes button be

00:32:38.636 --> 00:32:39.266 A:middle
Question 1.

00:32:39.846 --> 00:32:41.616 A:middle
And then, our no button also be

00:32:41.616 --> 00:32:42.206 A:middle
Question 1.

00:32:43.456 --> 00:32:44.296 A:middle
I'm going to point out that it

00:32:44.296 --> 00:32:45.206 A:middle
doesn't matter what these

00:32:45.206 --> 00:32:46.676 A:middle
strings are; all that matters is

00:32:46.676 --> 00:32:47.596 A:middle
that the two are the same.

00:32:48.036 --> 00:32:49.506 A:middle
But if I were to run this code

00:32:49.506 --> 00:32:50.916 A:middle
and select a radio button, all

00:32:50.916 --> 00:32:52.156 A:middle
of them would turn on or all of

00:32:52.156 --> 00:32:53.486 A:middle
them would turn off.

00:32:53.486 --> 00:32:55.116 A:middle
That's because we don't know, we

00:32:55.116 --> 00:32:55.676 A:middle
don't have a way to

00:32:55.676 --> 00:32:57.246 A:middle
differentiate the yes button

00:32:57.246 --> 00:32:58.016 A:middle
from the no button.

00:32:58.066 --> 00:32:59.856 A:middle
They're each going to have their

00:32:59.856 --> 00:33:01.406 A:middle
own unique kind of sub

00:32:59.856 --> 00:33:01.406 A:middle
own unique kind of sub

00:33:01.406 --> 00:33:02.036 A:middle
identifier.

00:33:02.646 --> 00:33:04.186 A:middle
We can do that by setting the

00:33:04.186 --> 00:33:05.126 A:middle
button widget state string

00:33:05.126 --> 00:33:05.556 A:middle
property.

00:33:06.406 --> 00:33:08.186 A:middle
Let's do that now.

00:33:08.186 --> 00:33:09.526 A:middle
We'll set our yes button to yes

00:33:09.656 --> 00:33:12.046 A:middle
and our no button to no.

00:33:12.616 --> 00:33:13.696 A:middle
But again, it doesn't matter

00:33:13.696 --> 00:33:14.566 A:middle
what these strings are.

00:33:15.006 --> 00:33:17.646 A:middle
I can have this one be Nicki and

00:33:17.736 --> 00:33:18.616 A:middle
this one be Brower.

00:33:19.676 --> 00:33:20.756 A:middle
All that matters is that they're

00:33:20.756 --> 00:33:21.106 A:middle
different.

00:33:21.656 --> 00:33:22.916 A:middle
So, now, we've grouped them

00:33:22.916 --> 00:33:24.516 A:middle
together with our field name

00:33:24.516 --> 00:33:25.906 A:middle
property, but we've also set

00:33:25.906 --> 00:33:27.356 A:middle
them apart with our button

00:33:27.356 --> 00:33:28.136 A:middle
widget state string.

00:33:28.636 --> 00:33:32.146 A:middle
Last but not least, we have our

00:33:32.146 --> 00:33:32.886 A:middle
reset button.

00:33:33.526 --> 00:33:35.636 A:middle
But again, we want to reset our

00:33:35.636 --> 00:33:37.086 A:middle
entire form back to its original

00:33:37.086 --> 00:33:37.426 A:middle
state.

00:33:38.086 --> 00:33:40.016 A:middle
And just like PDFAction URL and

00:33:40.016 --> 00:33:41.866 A:middle
PDFAction go to, we have

00:33:41.866 --> 00:33:43.366 A:middle
PDFActionResetForm.

00:33:44.016 --> 00:33:45.916 A:middle
Go ahead and create that now.

00:33:47.416 --> 00:33:49.966 A:middle
Well, how this action works is

00:33:49.966 --> 00:33:51.476 A:middle
it takes an array of strings,

00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:53.396 A:middle
strings that represent field

00:33:53.396 --> 00:33:54.896 A:middle
names like the ones we just set

00:33:54.896 --> 00:33:56.856 A:middle
on the radio button, and the

00:33:56.856 --> 00:33:58.046 A:middle
default behavior is when this

00:33:58.046 --> 00:33:59.376 A:middle
action is performed, it will

00:33:59.376 --> 00:34:00.986 A:middle
reset all of the widgets that

00:33:59.376 --> 00:34:00.986 A:middle
reset all of the widgets that

00:34:00.986 --> 00:34:03.016 A:middle
are associated with my array of

00:34:03.016 --> 00:34:03.886 A:middle
string field names.

00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:05.486 A:middle
But I don't want to have to go

00:34:05.486 --> 00:34:06.586 A:middle
through and figure out the field

00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:07.616 A:middle
names of all my widgets.

00:34:07.616 --> 00:34:08.856 A:middle
That just is too much work for

00:34:08.856 --> 00:34:09.005 A:middle
me.

00:34:09.005 --> 00:34:10.466 A:middle
So, I'm going to kind of change

00:34:10.466 --> 00:34:12.326 A:middle
the behavior of this action, and

00:34:12.326 --> 00:34:13.366 A:middle
I'm going to do that by setting

00:34:13.366 --> 00:34:14.795 A:middle
our fields included are clear

00:34:14.795 --> 00:34:15.766 A:middle
property to false.

00:34:16.246 --> 00:34:18.136 A:middle
So, with just one line of code,

00:34:18.136 --> 00:34:19.346 A:middle
I've kind of done two different

00:34:19.346 --> 00:34:19.676 A:middle
things.

00:34:20.426 --> 00:34:21.826 A:middle
I've now changed the behavior to

00:34:21.826 --> 00:34:23.196 A:middle
where when I press -- when I

00:34:23.196 --> 00:34:25.126 A:middle
perform this action, all of the

00:34:25.126 --> 00:34:27.036 A:middle
widgets not included in my list

00:34:27.036 --> 00:34:28.266 A:middle
are going to be cleared, and

00:34:28.266 --> 00:34:29.966 A:middle
also, I haven't set any on my

00:34:29.966 --> 00:34:30.346 A:middle
list.

00:34:30.906 --> 00:34:31.946 A:middle
So, now, when I perform this,

00:34:32.266 --> 00:34:33.576 A:middle
every widget in my document will

00:34:33.576 --> 00:34:34.716 A:middle
be cleared, which is exactly

00:34:34.716 --> 00:34:35.266 A:middle
what I wanted.

00:34:35.516 --> 00:34:37.366 A:middle
And then, of course, we have to

00:34:37.366 --> 00:34:38.456 A:middle
set the action property on our

00:34:38.456 --> 00:34:40.255 A:middle
button, and that's it, just

00:34:40.255 --> 00:34:40.985 A:middle
three lines of code.

00:34:41.436 --> 00:34:43.516 A:middle
So, let's rerun this and fill

00:34:43.516 --> 00:34:44.706 A:middle
out our survey from the very

00:34:44.706 --> 00:34:45.726 A:middle
beginning with everything

00:34:45.726 --> 00:34:46.416 A:middle
working properly.

00:34:47.056 --> 00:34:49.326 A:middle
Here we go; we have our name,

00:34:49.966 --> 00:34:52.505 A:middle
which is Nicki Brower; our date,

00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:53.926 A:middle
which is June 9.

00:34:54.406 --> 00:34:55.606 A:middle
We have the spacing that we

00:34:55.606 --> 00:34:57.426 A:middle
wanted, and I don't know if you

00:34:57.426 --> 00:34:58.386 A:middle
can hear, but I'm pressing a

00:34:58.386 --> 00:34:59.496 A:middle
button and I can't enter more

00:34:59.496 --> 00:35:01.496 A:middle
characters than what is desired,

00:34:59.496 --> 00:35:01.496 A:middle
characters than what is desired,

00:35:01.496 --> 00:35:02.586 A:middle
which is what we wanted.

00:35:03.356 --> 00:35:04.096 A:middle
Have you been to a music

00:35:04.096 --> 00:35:04.856 A:middle
festival before?

00:35:04.986 --> 00:35:06.516 A:middle
No. Wait, yes, I have.

00:35:07.346 --> 00:35:08.176 A:middle
Which of the following music

00:35:08.176 --> 00:35:09.296 A:middle
festivals have you attended?

00:35:09.436 --> 00:35:10.776 A:middle
I've been to iFestival,

00:35:10.776 --> 00:35:12.946 A:middle
Swiftopia, but not Applepalooza.

00:35:14.016 --> 00:35:15.436 A:middle
Give one recommendation to

00:35:15.436 --> 00:35:17.046 A:middle
improve a music festival.

00:35:17.916 --> 00:35:21.026 A:middle
All music festivals should be

00:35:21.026 --> 00:35:21.366 A:middle
free.

00:35:21.366 --> 00:35:23.816 A:middle
And I want to point out that our

00:35:23.816 --> 00:35:25.346 A:middle
text widgets by default are

00:35:25.346 --> 00:35:26.926 A:middle
single line, but if you want

00:35:26.926 --> 00:35:28.116 A:middle
them to be multiline and have

00:35:28.116 --> 00:35:29.186 A:middle
this word wrapping that I have

00:35:29.186 --> 00:35:30.736 A:middle
here, all it is, is a simple

00:35:30.736 --> 00:35:31.906 A:middle
category method that you have to

00:35:31.906 --> 00:35:32.216 A:middle
set.

00:35:32.856 --> 00:35:34.436 A:middle
And so now, with this PDF, I

00:35:34.436 --> 00:35:35.696 A:middle
could save it, and it'll have

00:35:35.696 --> 00:35:36.806 A:middle
all the values that I want, and

00:35:36.806 --> 00:35:38.176 A:middle
I could send it to people, and

00:35:38.176 --> 00:35:39.186 A:middle
they can see my values.

00:35:39.666 --> 00:35:41.886 A:middle
Or if I want, I can still go

00:35:41.886 --> 00:35:43.336 A:middle
ahead and clear my entire PDF

00:35:43.576 --> 00:35:45.326 A:middle
with my Obliviate button at the

00:35:45.326 --> 00:35:45.916 A:middle
very bottom.

00:35:46.346 --> 00:35:47.716 A:middle
So, I'll press it, and we're

00:35:47.716 --> 00:35:48.856 A:middle
back to the very beginning,

00:35:49.896 --> 00:35:51.226 A:middle
which is the behavior that we

00:35:51.226 --> 00:35:51.636 A:middle
wanted.

00:35:52.346 --> 00:35:53.586 A:middle
So, I showed you with PDFKit, it

00:35:53.586 --> 00:35:54.996 A:middle
really isn't that hard to take a

00:35:55.036 --> 00:35:57.126 A:middle
simple PDF, add some widgets,

00:35:57.126 --> 00:35:58.276 A:middle
and now you have a fully

00:35:58.276 --> 00:35:59.366 A:middle
interactive one that you can

00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:00.396 A:middle
share with whoever you want.

00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:00.396 A:middle
share with whoever you want.

00:36:00.496 --> 00:36:02.126 A:middle
And I don't know about you guys,

00:36:02.126 --> 00:36:03.666 A:middle
but I think that's pretty cool.

00:36:03.666 --> 00:36:04.976 A:middle
So, we're going to go ahead, oh!

00:36:05.516 --> 00:36:08.436 A:middle
[ Audience Applause ]

00:36:08.936 --> 00:36:09.726 A:middle
So, we're going to go back to

00:36:09.726 --> 00:36:10.686 A:middle
Jeremy, and he's going to talk

00:36:10.686 --> 00:36:11.976 A:middle
about a few best practices.

00:36:16.416 --> 00:36:16.856 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

00:36:17.316 --> 00:36:18.476 A:middle
Thank you very much, Nicki.

00:36:19.276 --> 00:36:21.116 A:middle
So, this year, Annotations have

00:36:21.116 --> 00:36:22.596 A:middle
greatly improved, and we've also

00:36:23.006 --> 00:36:24.956 A:middle
fixed a lot of issues in PDFKit

00:36:24.956 --> 00:36:26.376 A:middle
and greatly improved other

00:36:26.376 --> 00:36:27.276 A:middle
functionality too.

00:36:27.696 --> 00:36:29.096 A:middle
And with our experience, we

00:36:29.096 --> 00:36:30.076 A:middle
really want to give you a couple

00:36:30.076 --> 00:36:30.936 A:middle
of recommendations that you

00:36:30.936 --> 00:36:32.326 A:middle
could take away and improve on

00:36:32.326 --> 00:36:33.196 A:middle
your code today.

00:36:33.786 --> 00:36:35.346 A:middle
So, a couple of recommendations

00:36:35.346 --> 00:36:35.816 A:middle
straight away.

00:36:36.216 --> 00:36:38.076 A:middle
Use annotations for any sort of

00:36:38.076 --> 00:36:40.396 A:middle
interactive elements or complex

00:36:40.396 --> 00:36:41.786 A:middle
graphics that you want to do at

00:36:41.786 --> 00:36:42.346 A:middle
run time.

00:36:42.686 --> 00:36:44.256 A:middle
We've greatly put effort into

00:36:44.256 --> 00:36:45.576 A:middle
optimizing these graphics, so

00:36:45.576 --> 00:36:46.696 A:middle
it's a great option to take

00:36:46.696 --> 00:36:47.276 A:middle
advantage of.

00:36:47.656 --> 00:36:48.746 A:middle
And of course, if you are going

00:36:48.746 --> 00:36:50.516 A:middle
to be mutating PDFAnnotations,

00:36:50.986 --> 00:36:51.956 A:middle
take advantage of that

00:36:51.956 --> 00:36:53.786 A:middle
PDFAnnotationUtilities category

00:36:53.786 --> 00:36:54.866 A:middle
class extension.

00:36:55.266 --> 00:36:56.536 A:middle
The reason why, as Nicki said,

00:36:56.536 --> 00:36:57.736 A:middle
is that these are statically

00:36:57.736 --> 00:36:58.536 A:middle
typed functions.

00:36:58.816 --> 00:37:00.046 A:middle
You don't have to worry that a

00:36:58.816 --> 00:37:00.046 A:middle
You don't have to worry that a

00:37:00.046 --> 00:37:01.196 A:middle
line point is an array of

00:37:01.236 --> 00:37:01.696 A:middle
points.

00:37:01.696 --> 00:37:03.046 A:middle
Actually, a line point is just a

00:37:03.146 --> 00:37:05.186 A:middle
CG point, a pair of CG points.

00:37:05.516 --> 00:37:06.396 A:middle
It's really straightforward.

00:37:07.026 --> 00:37:08.546 A:middle
Finally, if you want to do a

00:37:08.546 --> 00:37:10.506 A:middle
custom PDFPage drawing, it is

00:37:10.506 --> 00:37:12.186 A:middle
required that your code be

00:37:12.376 --> 00:37:13.246 A:middle
thread-safe.

00:37:13.566 --> 00:37:14.786 A:middle
The reason why is, again, we've

00:37:14.786 --> 00:37:15.976 A:middle
put so much effort into

00:37:15.976 --> 00:37:17.576 A:middle
optimizing PDFKit to draw as

00:37:17.576 --> 00:37:19.086 A:middle
fast as possible, we want to

00:37:19.086 --> 00:37:20.256 A:middle
take advantage of all the cores

00:37:20.256 --> 00:37:21.236 A:middle
that our different platforms

00:37:21.236 --> 00:37:21.486 A:middle
have.

00:37:21.926 --> 00:37:23.216 A:middle
And since many of our platforms

00:37:23.216 --> 00:37:25.146 A:middle
are multi-core, it's absolutely

00:37:25.146 --> 00:37:26.766 A:middle
possible that two threads might

00:37:26.766 --> 00:37:28.316 A:middle
be drawing your PDFPage maybe in

00:37:28.316 --> 00:37:30.396 A:middle
the main view and PDFPage as a

00:37:30.396 --> 00:37:31.766 A:middle
thumbnail at the same time.

00:37:32.186 --> 00:37:33.276 A:middle
So, make sure that your code is

00:37:33.276 --> 00:37:33.846 A:middle
thread-safe.

00:37:34.296 --> 00:37:35.636 A:middle
And along these lines, if you

00:37:35.636 --> 00:37:37.386 A:middle
are doing custom PDFPage

00:37:37.386 --> 00:37:39.116 A:middle
drawing, make sure that you call

00:37:39.116 --> 00:37:40.556 A:middle
super at the appropriate time.

00:37:40.686 --> 00:37:41.796 A:middle
If you want to put your graphics

00:37:41.796 --> 00:37:43.236 A:middle
on top of the existing content,

00:37:43.536 --> 00:37:44.896 A:middle
call super, and then execute

00:37:44.896 --> 00:37:45.896 A:middle
your custom drawing code.

00:37:46.236 --> 00:37:47.216 A:middle
Or if you want to put your

00:37:47.216 --> 00:37:48.396 A:middle
custom graphics behind that

00:37:48.426 --> 00:37:50.306 A:middle
content, do your custom code

00:37:50.306 --> 00:37:51.966 A:middle
first, and then execute super

00:37:51.966 --> 00:37:52.456 A:middle
last.

00:37:53.146 --> 00:37:54.706 A:middle
Now, what we don't recommend,

00:37:54.816 --> 00:37:57.056 A:middle
moving forward, is because

00:37:57.136 --> 00:37:58.976 A:middle
PDFView derives from UIView and

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:00.166 A:middle
NSView on each platform

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:00.166 A:middle
NSView on each platform

00:38:00.166 --> 00:38:02.426 A:middle
respectively, those view classes

00:38:02.426 --> 00:38:04.166 A:middle
give you the ability to call a

00:38:04.166 --> 00:38:06.006 A:middle
method, call set needs display

00:38:06.006 --> 00:38:07.386 A:middle
or some mutation of that method.

00:38:07.666 --> 00:38:08.536 A:middle
And that method is really

00:38:08.536 --> 00:38:10.096 A:middle
expensive because refreshing all

00:38:10.096 --> 00:38:11.936 A:middle
of the content at once is just

00:38:12.036 --> 00:38:12.576 A:middle
expensive.

00:38:12.926 --> 00:38:13.816 A:middle
So, try to avoid it.

00:38:13.816 --> 00:38:14.876 A:middle
Again, if you want to do custom

00:38:14.876 --> 00:38:15.956 A:middle
graphics, take a look at

00:38:15.956 --> 00:38:16.576 A:middle
Annotations.

00:38:17.276 --> 00:38:19.266 A:middle
Finally, don't mutate PDFPage

00:38:19.266 --> 00:38:20.866 A:middle
properties at the same time from

00:38:20.866 --> 00:38:21.446 A:middle
different threads.

00:38:21.736 --> 00:38:23.806 A:middle
A good example is don't rotate

00:38:23.806 --> 00:38:25.356 A:middle
the PDFPage while you're drawing

00:38:25.356 --> 00:38:26.676 A:middle
a thumbnail at the same time.

00:38:27.016 --> 00:38:28.406 A:middle
There might be some undefined

00:38:28.526 --> 00:38:30.406 A:middle
visual effects that might happen

00:38:30.546 --> 00:38:31.446 A:middle
during those cases.

00:38:32.116 --> 00:38:33.596 A:middle
And finally, this is specific to

00:38:33.596 --> 00:38:35.266 A:middle
Mac OS only, but try to stay

00:38:35.266 --> 00:38:36.936 A:middle
away from the deprecated drawing

00:38:36.936 --> 00:38:37.346 A:middle
methods.

00:38:37.786 --> 00:38:39.076 A:middle
The reason why goes all the way

00:38:39.076 --> 00:38:40.586 A:middle
back to multi-threaded drawing.

00:38:40.966 --> 00:38:42.236 A:middle
So, we build these really

00:38:42.236 --> 00:38:43.456 A:middle
complicated contexts so you

00:38:43.456 --> 00:38:44.286 A:middle
could draw your beautiful

00:38:44.286 --> 00:38:45.916 A:middle
graphics into, and we want to

00:38:45.916 --> 00:38:46.816 A:middle
give you these contexts

00:38:46.896 --> 00:38:47.746 A:middle
explicitly.

00:38:47.746 --> 00:38:48.976 A:middle
That's what the new signatures

00:38:48.976 --> 00:38:49.326 A:middle
are for.

00:38:49.636 --> 00:38:50.836 A:middle
The old signatures had an

00:38:50.886 --> 00:38:52.316 A:middle
implicit context, and we want

00:38:52.316 --> 00:38:53.366 A:middle
you to avoid that as much as

00:38:53.366 --> 00:38:53.806 A:middle
possible.

00:38:54.516 --> 00:38:56.096 A:middle
So, these are bits and pieces

00:38:56.096 --> 00:38:56.836 A:middle
that we recommend.

00:38:57.866 --> 00:38:59.366 A:middle
But looking at PDFKit again, we

00:38:59.366 --> 00:39:01.076 A:middle
want to emphasize it's really

00:38:59.366 --> 00:39:01.076 A:middle
want to emphasize it's really

00:39:01.226 --> 00:39:02.626 A:middle
easy for app developers to get

00:39:02.626 --> 00:39:04.186 A:middle
started with PDFHandling today.

00:39:04.186 --> 00:39:05.956 A:middle
They could use PDFView just to

00:39:05.956 --> 00:39:07.226 A:middle
look at a document, or you could

00:39:07.226 --> 00:39:08.906 A:middle
totally author a brand new one,

00:39:09.156 --> 00:39:10.216 A:middle
or you could take an existing

00:39:10.216 --> 00:39:11.266 A:middle
document, add a bunch of new

00:39:11.266 --> 00:39:12.226 A:middle
content inside.

00:39:12.866 --> 00:39:15.176 A:middle
It's also really easy to read,

00:39:15.306 --> 00:39:16.886 A:middle
modify, and write these files,

00:39:16.886 --> 00:39:17.796 A:middle
and you could write it with the

00:39:17.796 --> 00:39:19.596 A:middle
latest encryption supported by

00:39:19.596 --> 00:39:20.886 A:middle
the PDF specification.

00:39:21.706 --> 00:39:22.966 A:middle
Of course, when you do write

00:39:22.966 --> 00:39:24.416 A:middle
these files with that latest PDF

00:39:24.416 --> 00:39:26.026 A:middle
specification, you could author

00:39:26.026 --> 00:39:27.236 A:middle
these files with these really

00:39:27.236 --> 00:39:28.746 A:middle
awesome form field widgets.

00:39:28.746 --> 00:39:30.046 A:middle
So, that means fully interactive

00:39:30.046 --> 00:39:31.266 A:middle
forms that you could fill out

00:39:31.266 --> 00:39:32.866 A:middle
for your business needs or

00:39:32.986 --> 00:39:34.406 A:middle
whatever other needs you have.

00:39:35.346 --> 00:39:37.106 A:middle
Finally, just by adopting

00:39:37.106 --> 00:39:38.626 A:middle
PDFView, don't forget, you get

00:39:38.686 --> 00:39:40.186 A:middle
rich accessibility improvements

00:39:40.186 --> 00:39:41.396 A:middle
that we've worked really hard on

00:39:41.396 --> 00:39:43.136 A:middle
this year for both platforms.

00:39:43.496 --> 00:39:44.916 A:middle
So, your users will really take

00:39:44.916 --> 00:39:46.646 A:middle
