00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:24.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Battery life is very

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:25.416 A:middle
important to your users.

00:00:25.906 --> 00:00:27.466 A:middle
And apps are directly tied to

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.126 A:middle
battery life.

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.066 A:middle
So as developers, it's very

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.486 A:middle
important that we're careful

00:00:31.486 --> 00:00:32.536 A:middle
about how we write our code.

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:35.546 A:middle
And the reason for this is if

00:00:35.546 --> 00:00:37.196 A:middle
I'm a user and I'm having bad

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:38.746 A:middle
battery life, the first thing

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:40.306 A:middle
I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:41.826 A:middle
go to the Battery Usage screen.

00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:44.036 A:middle
I'm going to take a look at what

00:00:44.036 --> 00:00:45.066 A:middle
apps are using a lot of my

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:45.486 A:middle
energy.

00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:48.096 A:middle
If I notice that your app is

00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:49.406 A:middle
near the top and I don't expect

00:00:49.406 --> 00:00:50.906 A:middle
it to be there, I'm not going to

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:52.626 A:middle
be very happy about that and I

00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:53.976 A:middle
may even delete your app.

00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:57.936 A:middle
And so today, I'm going to talk

00:00:57.936 --> 00:00:59.376 A:middle
about some battery life

00:00:59.376 --> 00:00:59.986 A:middle
concepts.

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:01.366 A:middle
Then, we're going to move on and

00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.466 A:middle
we're going to talk about energy

00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.606 A:middle
efficient coding practices.

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:04.855 A:middle
From there, my colleague will

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:06.246 A:middle
come up and talk to you about

00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:07.746 A:middle
energy debugging tools that are

00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:09.076 A:middle
available to you as well as give

00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:09.636 A:middle
you a demo.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:11.166 A:middle
And then we'll wrap it up with

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:11.896 A:middle
some final thoughts.

00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:14.156 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:16.696 A:middle
What is energy?

00:01:17.326 --> 00:01:18.956 A:middle
Well, energy is the product of

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:19.886 A:middle
power and time.

00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:21.086 A:middle
And I'd like to illustrate this

00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:21.756 A:middle
with an example.

00:01:22.286 --> 00:01:25.336 A:middle
As you can see here, when the

00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:26.976 A:middle
device is idle, the power is

00:01:26.976 --> 00:01:27.566 A:middle
very low.

00:01:28.246 --> 00:01:29.586 A:middle
Yet when the device is active,

00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:30.756 A:middle
the power is very high.

00:01:30.946 --> 00:01:32.936 A:middle
And you also notice that the

00:01:32.936 --> 00:01:34.126 A:middle
power can be even higher and

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:35.276 A:middle
that depends on how much work

00:01:35.276 --> 00:01:36.386 A:middle
you're doing or the type of work

00:01:36.386 --> 00:01:36.896 A:middle
that you're doing.

00:01:37.726 --> 00:01:39.256 A:middle
You'll also notice that there's

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:42.356 A:middle
overhead and that's the amount

00:01:42.356 --> 00:01:44.166 A:middle
of power that's needed to bring

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:46.336 A:middle
the hardware up to be able to do

00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:47.436 A:middle
your work as well as put it back

00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:47.836 A:middle
to sleep.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:51.326 A:middle
And so as I said before, energy

00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:52.786 A:middle
is the product of power and time

00:01:53.386 --> 00:01:54.446 A:middle
and that's the area under the

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:54.726 A:middle
curve.

00:01:55.626 --> 00:01:56.666 A:middle
And I'd like to take this one

00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:57.226 A:middle
step further.

00:01:59.456 --> 00:02:01.676 A:middle
The energy that you have is

00:01:59.456 --> 00:02:01.676 A:middle
The energy that you have is

00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:03.556 A:middle
split into two regions: fixed

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.546 A:middle
costs and dynamic costs.

00:02:06.216 --> 00:02:07.956 A:middle
The dynamic costs are the work

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:10.066 A:middle
that you're doing and the fixed

00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:12.546 A:middle
costs are that overhead that we

00:02:12.546 --> 00:02:14.446 A:middle
talked about earlier, the amount

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:16.096 A:middle
of energy needed to bring the

00:02:16.096 --> 00:02:17.636 A:middle
hardware up to do your work in

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:18.226 A:middle
the first place.

00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:19.856 A:middle
So even if you're doing a small

00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:21.316 A:middle
amount of work, you're still

00:02:21.316 --> 00:02:21.976 A:middle
going to have to pay those

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:22.606 A:middle
overhead costs.

00:02:23.156 --> 00:02:24.616 A:middle
And we'll talk more about this

00:02:24.616 --> 00:02:24.886 A:middle
later.

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:28.796 A:middle
So our devices are very powerful

00:02:28.796 --> 00:02:30.606 A:middle
and so it's important that as

00:02:30.606 --> 00:02:32.316 A:middle
developers we're very careful

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:34.806 A:middle
about when we use that power.

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:36.666 A:middle
We need to really think about,

00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:38.236 A:middle
do we need to use this power to

00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:40.106 A:middle
deliver a great experience to

00:02:40.106 --> 00:02:40.646 A:middle
our users.

00:02:40.756 --> 00:02:42.276 A:middle
And if we do, we should go ahead

00:02:42.276 --> 00:02:43.076 A:middle
and use that power.

00:02:43.076 --> 00:02:44.376 A:middle
But maybe there're other times

00:02:44.376 --> 00:02:45.866 A:middle
where we can conserve it.

00:02:46.996 --> 00:02:48.296 A:middle
So now you might be thinking,

00:02:48.576 --> 00:02:49.526 A:middle
what consumes energy.

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:51.886 A:middle
Well, actually nearly everything

00:02:51.886 --> 00:02:53.316 A:middle
in our devices consume energy

00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:55.236 A:middle
but today I really want to focus

00:02:55.526 --> 00:02:56.506 A:middle
on four main things.

00:02:57.586 --> 00:03:00.016 A:middle
And these are processing,

00:02:57.586 --> 00:03:00.016 A:middle
And these are processing,

00:03:01.106 --> 00:03:04.206 A:middle
networking, location, and

00:03:04.206 --> 00:03:04.936 A:middle
finally graphics.

00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:06.436 A:middle
These are the four main things I

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:07.386 A:middle
really want you to think about

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:09.046 A:middle
when you're writing your apps.

00:03:12.036 --> 00:03:15.046 A:middle
So how can I reduce my energy

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:15.626 A:middle
consumption?

00:03:16.816 --> 00:03:18.886 A:middle
First, I want to identify the

00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:20.466 A:middle
work that I need to do, really

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.346 A:middle
think about will this work, help

00:03:22.456 --> 00:03:23.466 A:middle
your user.

00:03:24.586 --> 00:03:26.736 A:middle
And if it won't, don't do it at

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:28.186 A:middle
all or maybe defer it to a later

00:03:28.186 --> 00:03:28.486 A:middle
time.

00:03:29.346 --> 00:03:30.286 A:middle
Next, you'll want to optimize

00:03:30.286 --> 00:03:30.796 A:middle
your work.

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:32.126 A:middle
Once you've identified the work

00:03:32.156 --> 00:03:34.046 A:middle
that you do need to do, try to

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:35.226 A:middle
do it as quickly and efficiently

00:03:35.226 --> 00:03:35.786 A:middle
as possible.

00:03:36.856 --> 00:03:37.886 A:middle
Next, you'll want to coalesce,

00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:39.326 A:middle
try to batch up your

00:03:39.326 --> 00:03:40.056 A:middle
transactions.

00:03:40.336 --> 00:03:41.586 A:middle
Don't do them spaced apart.

00:03:42.406 --> 00:03:43.486 A:middle
And finally, reduce the

00:03:43.486 --> 00:03:45.406 A:middle
frequency of your work.

00:03:46.596 --> 00:03:48.236 A:middle
So let's see how we can apply

00:03:48.236 --> 00:03:50.066 A:middle
these principles to your apps.

00:03:50.646 --> 00:03:52.576 A:middle
And first I want to start with

00:03:52.576 --> 00:03:53.056 A:middle
networking.

00:03:53.606 --> 00:03:54.796 A:middle
So if you're developing an app

00:03:54.796 --> 00:03:56.366 A:middle
that uses networking or you have

00:03:56.366 --> 00:03:57.326 A:middle
an app that does networking,

00:03:57.386 --> 00:03:58.066 A:middle
you'll really want to pay

00:03:58.066 --> 00:03:58.646 A:middle
attention here.

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:02.446 A:middle
And so I'd like to start with an

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:02.446 A:middle
And so I'd like to start with an

00:04:02.446 --> 00:04:02.946 A:middle
example.

00:04:03.646 --> 00:04:04.806 A:middle
I've been working on a social

00:04:04.806 --> 00:04:07.326 A:middle
networking app and this app has

00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:10.466 A:middle
three parts: a main feed, it has

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:12.726 A:middle
the ability to post a photo, and

00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:14.696 A:middle
finally the ability to send some

00:04:14.696 --> 00:04:15.666 A:middle
analytics data.

00:04:16.226 --> 00:04:19.286 A:middle
And so let's start with the main

00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:19.596 A:middle
feed.

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:21.815 A:middle
In my current implementation,

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:23.776 A:middle
I'm just reloading on a fixed

00:04:23.776 --> 00:04:25.536 A:middle
timer over and over again.

00:04:26.376 --> 00:04:27.206 A:middle
And let's take a look at the

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:28.976 A:middle
energy impact in doing so.

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:31.056 A:middle
Here you can see that at first

00:04:31.056 --> 00:04:33.186 A:middle
glance doesn't look to be that

00:04:33.186 --> 00:04:35.796 A:middle
energy intensive; however, as we

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:37.396 A:middle
talked about earlier, they're

00:04:37.396 --> 00:04:39.496 A:middle
actually those overhead costs

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:42.486 A:middle
and that's the cost to bring up

00:04:42.486 --> 00:04:43.536 A:middle
the radio and put it back to

00:04:43.536 --> 00:04:44.886 A:middle
sleep in this case.

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:47.676 A:middle
And so even though you're just

00:04:47.676 --> 00:04:48.756 A:middle
doing a small amount of work,

00:04:48.796 --> 00:04:49.836 A:middle
you're paying those overhead

00:04:49.836 --> 00:04:51.596 A:middle
costs and this is really

00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:52.896 A:middle
resulting in a big energy

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:53.276 A:middle
impact.

00:04:54.116 --> 00:04:56.246 A:middle
So how can we optimize this?

00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:59.636 A:middle
First, we'll want to reload only

00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:02.216 A:middle
on user interaction or maybe a

00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:02.216 A:middle
on user interaction or maybe a

00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:03.656 A:middle
notification such as an urgent

00:05:03.656 --> 00:05:03.976 A:middle
news alert.

00:05:05.566 --> 00:05:06.896 A:middle
Next, you'll want to use NSURL

00:05:06.896 --> 00:05:08.716 A:middle
Session Default Session and

00:05:08.716 --> 00:05:10.766 A:middle
there's a new property called

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:11.736 A:middle
Waits for Connectivity.

00:05:12.656 --> 00:05:14.266 A:middle
This will allow you the ability

00:05:14.266 --> 00:05:16.146 A:middle
to know when you can connect to

00:05:16.146 --> 00:05:17.216 A:middle
the server of your choice.

00:05:17.976 --> 00:05:19.646 A:middle
Additionally, you'll want to use

00:05:19.646 --> 00:05:21.246 A:middle
NSURL Session Cache as well.

00:05:22.396 --> 00:05:24.086 A:middle
This will allow you to not

00:05:24.086 --> 00:05:26.366 A:middle
re-download the same pieces of

00:05:26.366 --> 00:05:28.276 A:middle
your main feed over and over

00:05:28.276 --> 00:05:29.836 A:middle
again and incur those extra

00:05:30.016 --> 00:05:30.516 A:middle
costs.

00:05:30.696 --> 00:05:34.216 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the

00:05:34.216 --> 00:05:35.166 A:middle
energy impact with these

00:05:35.166 --> 00:05:35.916 A:middle
optimizations.

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:38.766 A:middle
As you can see here, we've

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:41.026 A:middle
removed that recurring spike.

00:05:41.546 --> 00:05:42.676 A:middle
Now you're only reloading on

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.266 A:middle
user interaction and

00:05:44.266 --> 00:05:44.996 A:middle
notification.

00:05:45.536 --> 00:05:46.956 A:middle
And you also removed that

00:05:46.956 --> 00:05:47.916 A:middle
overhead cost as well.

00:05:48.906 --> 00:05:49.896 A:middle
This is great for battery life.

00:05:51.716 --> 00:05:53.336 A:middle
So let's see how we can set this

00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:53.536 A:middle
up.

00:05:54.236 --> 00:05:55.166 A:middle
First, we'll want to go ahead

00:05:55.236 --> 00:05:57.166 A:middle
and create a default session

00:05:57.166 --> 00:05:57.856 A:middle
configuration.

00:05:59.206 --> 00:06:00.906 A:middle
Then, we'll move on and we'll

00:05:59.206 --> 00:06:00.906 A:middle
Then, we'll move on and we'll

00:06:00.906 --> 00:06:02.006 A:middle
set the waits connectivity

00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:03.736 A:middle
property to true.

00:06:05.136 --> 00:06:06.346 A:middle
And finally, we'll configure our

00:06:06.346 --> 00:06:06.726 A:middle
cache.

00:06:06.726 --> 00:06:10.386 A:middle
So that was the main feed.

00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:12.186 A:middle
Now let's move on and talk about

00:06:12.186 --> 00:06:13.366 A:middle
how we can post a photo.

00:06:14.126 --> 00:06:15.436 A:middle
So in my current implementation,

00:06:16.196 --> 00:06:17.366 A:middle
right now I'm just going to send

00:06:17.366 --> 00:06:19.016 A:middle
this photo immediately and I'm

00:06:19.016 --> 00:06:20.636 A:middle
going to retry on every failure.

00:06:21.376 --> 00:06:22.326 A:middle
That's because I really want to

00:06:22.326 --> 00:06:23.406 A:middle
get this photo to my server.

00:06:24.246 --> 00:06:25.006 A:middle
And let's take a look at the

00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:26.396 A:middle
energy impact in doing so.

00:06:27.496 --> 00:06:28.776 A:middle
As you can see here, the energy

00:06:28.776 --> 00:06:29.896 A:middle
impact is very high.

00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:31.956 A:middle
We're spending a lot of time to

00:06:31.956 --> 00:06:32.866 A:middle
send up our photo.

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:34.316 A:middle
And finally it times-out, maybe

00:06:34.316 --> 00:06:35.076 A:middle
because the networking

00:06:35.076 --> 00:06:35.916 A:middle
conditions are poor.

00:06:36.036 --> 00:06:39.516 A:middle
And again, we retry because we

00:06:39.516 --> 00:06:40.836 A:middle
really want to get this photo to

00:06:40.836 --> 00:06:41.586 A:middle
our server.

00:06:41.586 --> 00:06:42.506 A:middle
And again, we spend a lot of

00:06:42.506 --> 00:06:44.716 A:middle
energy while we're not providing

00:06:44.926 --> 00:06:46.076 A:middle
much utility for our user

00:06:46.076 --> 00:06:47.096 A:middle
because this photo is still not

00:06:47.096 --> 00:06:47.856 A:middle
getting to our server.

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:49.856 A:middle
And this may repeat over and

00:06:49.856 --> 00:06:50.376 A:middle
over again.

00:06:51.546 --> 00:06:52.786 A:middle
So how can we optimize this?

00:06:53.816 --> 00:06:55.026 A:middle
First, we'll want to make sure

00:06:55.026 --> 00:06:56.596 A:middle
we really minimize our retries.

00:06:57.436 --> 00:06:58.616 A:middle
Only retry maybe two or three

00:06:58.616 --> 00:06:59.026 A:middle
times.

00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:01.956 A:middle
Next, set reasonable timeouts,

00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:01.956 A:middle
Next, set reasonable timeouts,

00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:03.426 A:middle
maybe 30 seconds or a minute.

00:07:03.576 --> 00:07:04.856 A:middle
Don't spend too much time trying

00:07:04.996 --> 00:07:05.986 A:middle
in case you're in those bad

00:07:05.986 --> 00:07:06.856 A:middle
networking conditions.

00:07:08.286 --> 00:07:09.426 A:middle
Finally, you'll want to batch

00:07:09.426 --> 00:07:10.806 A:middle
your transactions, so if you

00:07:10.806 --> 00:07:12.006 A:middle
have other photos to post at the

00:07:12.006 --> 00:07:13.836 A:middle
same time, go ahead and post

00:07:13.836 --> 00:07:14.316 A:middle
those as well.

00:07:15.296 --> 00:07:16.906 A:middle
Finally, if your retry limit is

00:07:16.906 --> 00:07:18.656 A:middle
hit, and you're not sure what to

00:07:18.656 --> 00:07:20.276 A:middle
do, maybe create a background

00:07:20.276 --> 00:07:20.666 A:middle
session.

00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:22.526 A:middle
This will allow you to hand off

00:07:22.526 --> 00:07:24.126 A:middle
your photo upload to the system

00:07:24.196 --> 00:07:25.356 A:middle
and it can find a good time to

00:07:25.356 --> 00:07:26.506 A:middle
do your work.

00:07:27.096 --> 00:07:28.706 A:middle
So let's take a look at the

00:07:28.706 --> 00:07:29.656 A:middle
energy impact with these

00:07:29.766 --> 00:07:30.446 A:middle
optimizations.

00:07:31.776 --> 00:07:33.446 A:middle
As we can see here, now we've

00:07:33.446 --> 00:07:34.626 A:middle
really reduced the amount of

00:07:34.626 --> 00:07:35.676 A:middle
energy that we're spending both

00:07:35.676 --> 00:07:37.896 A:middle
in the cost to send our photo as

00:07:37.896 --> 00:07:39.206 A:middle
well as that overhead cost.

00:07:40.316 --> 00:07:41.576 A:middle
Additionally, you might see that

00:07:41.576 --> 00:07:42.576 A:middle
we're still timing out, maybe

00:07:42.576 --> 00:07:43.416 A:middle
because those bad networking

00:07:43.416 --> 00:07:45.056 A:middle
conditions are still there, but

00:07:45.056 --> 00:07:46.656 A:middle
yet the second time we retry, we

00:07:46.656 --> 00:07:47.656 A:middle
just go ahead and create a

00:07:47.656 --> 00:07:48.666 A:middle
background session and now we're

00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:50.236 A:middle
going to let the system handle

00:07:50.686 --> 00:07:51.576 A:middle
uploading our photo.

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.406 A:middle
So that was how we can post a

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:54.256 A:middle
photo efficiently.

00:07:54.826 --> 00:07:55.626 A:middle
Now let's talk a little bit

00:07:55.626 --> 00:07:57.116 A:middle
about how we can send up

00:07:57.116 --> 00:07:57.856 A:middle
analytics data.

00:07:57.956 --> 00:07:59.686 A:middle
And as developers, we all really

00:07:59.686 --> 00:08:01.426 A:middle
care about how users are using

00:07:59.686 --> 00:08:01.426 A:middle
care about how users are using

00:08:01.426 --> 00:08:01.796 A:middle
our apps.

00:08:01.796 --> 00:08:03.066 A:middle
So we want to make sure that the

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:04.876 A:middle
data that we're sending does not

00:08:04.876 --> 00:08:07.556 A:middle
have an energy impact and we can

00:08:07.556 --> 00:08:09.006 A:middle
do that by using Background

00:08:09.006 --> 00:08:09.366 A:middle
Session.

00:08:10.086 --> 00:08:11.376 A:middle
This provides the ability to

00:08:11.376 --> 00:08:13.246 A:middle
hand off your upload or download

00:08:13.246 --> 00:08:14.536 A:middle
to the system to do it at a good

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:14.846 A:middle
time.

00:08:15.396 --> 00:08:16.486 A:middle
Additionally, it provides

00:08:16.486 --> 00:08:17.586 A:middle
automatic retries so you don't

00:08:17.586 --> 00:08:19.906 A:middle
have to worry about handling

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:22.046 A:middle
that retry policy yourself.

00:08:22.566 --> 00:08:25.276 A:middle
Next, it also provides

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:26.256 A:middle
throughput monitoring which

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:28.396 A:middle
means that if your throughput is

00:08:28.396 --> 00:08:29.666 A:middle
very low, for instance you're in

00:08:29.666 --> 00:08:31.186 A:middle
those poor network conditions,

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:33.876 A:middle
your task will be stopped and

00:08:33.876 --> 00:08:35.366 A:middle
retried at a later time when it

00:08:35.366 --> 00:08:36.166 A:middle
thinks it will succeed.

00:08:36.546 --> 00:08:38.385 A:middle
Finally, there's some new

00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:40.596 A:middle
properties called start time and

00:08:40.596 --> 00:08:41.336 A:middle
workload size.

00:08:41.785 --> 00:08:43.035 A:middle
This will help you indicate to

00:08:43.035 --> 00:08:44.226 A:middle
the system the best time to do

00:08:44.226 --> 00:08:45.326 A:middle
your work.

00:08:46.336 --> 00:08:48.446 A:middle
And finally, you'll also want to

00:08:48.446 --> 00:08:49.516 A:middle
set the discretionary property

00:08:49.516 --> 00:08:50.496 A:middle
whenever you're doing work

00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:51.926 A:middle
that's not immediately relevant

00:08:51.926 --> 00:08:52.556 A:middle
to your user.

00:08:53.406 --> 00:08:54.316 A:middle
This will allow the system to

00:08:54.316 --> 00:08:55.476 A:middle
find the most energy efficient

00:08:55.476 --> 00:08:59.626 A:middle
time to do your work as well.

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:00.646 A:middle
So let's take a look at an

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:00.646 A:middle
So let's take a look at an

00:09:00.646 --> 00:09:01.116 A:middle
example.

00:09:01.926 --> 00:09:03.906 A:middle
Here, we can see that right now

00:09:03.906 --> 00:09:04.876 A:middle
I'm not using Background

00:09:04.876 --> 00:09:05.216 A:middle
Session.

00:09:05.246 --> 00:09:06.786 A:middle
I'm just going ahead and sending

00:09:07.086 --> 00:09:08.516 A:middle
my data as soon as I have it

00:09:08.516 --> 00:09:09.566 A:middle
ready to send to my server.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.216 A:middle
Additionally, there's some other

00:09:11.216 --> 00:09:12.836 A:middle
networking that's occurring in

00:09:12.836 --> 00:09:13.296 A:middle
the future.

00:09:14.466 --> 00:09:15.886 A:middle
And right now we're paying two

00:09:15.886 --> 00:09:16.806 A:middle
overhead costs.

00:09:17.376 --> 00:09:18.286 A:middle
So let's say that we use

00:09:18.286 --> 00:09:19.536 A:middle
Background Session.

00:09:20.076 --> 00:09:22.416 A:middle
Now we can see that Background

00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:24.676 A:middle
Session has allowed these events

00:09:24.676 --> 00:09:26.356 A:middle
to coalesce together and saved

00:09:26.356 --> 00:09:28.316 A:middle
us that extra overhead by

00:09:28.316 --> 00:09:29.286 A:middle
combining it with the other

00:09:29.286 --> 00:09:30.026 A:middle
networking that was already

00:09:30.026 --> 00:09:30.926 A:middle
going to happen at a future

00:09:30.926 --> 00:09:31.176 A:middle
time.

00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:33.106 A:middle
This will really help battery

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:33.976 A:middle
life for your users.

00:09:38.046 --> 00:09:38.736 A:middle
So let's take a look at how we

00:09:38.736 --> 00:09:39.416 A:middle
can set this up.

00:09:40.116 --> 00:09:40.826 A:middle
First, we'll want to go ahead

00:09:40.826 --> 00:09:41.766 A:middle
and create our Background

00:09:41.766 --> 00:09:42.856 A:middle
Session configuration.

00:09:43.386 --> 00:09:44.156 A:middle
Then, we'll move on and we'll

00:09:44.156 --> 00:09:46.056 A:middle
set the discretionary property

00:09:46.626 --> 00:09:47.916 A:middle
to true.

00:09:48.136 --> 00:09:49.926 A:middle
Next, we'll go ahead and we'll

00:09:49.926 --> 00:09:51.456 A:middle
set some properties like start

00:09:51.456 --> 00:09:53.706 A:middle
time and the expected workload

00:09:53.706 --> 00:09:53.966 A:middle
size.

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:56.366 A:middle
And finally, we'll resume our

00:09:56.366 --> 00:09:56.676 A:middle
task.

00:09:56.676 --> 00:09:58.476 A:middle
So that was how we can send up

00:09:58.476 --> 00:09:59.576 A:middle
our analytics data in an

00:09:59.576 --> 00:09:59.976 A:middle
efficient way.

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:01.646 A:middle
Now I want to talk to you a

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:03.276 A:middle
little bit about watchOS.

00:10:04.566 --> 00:10:06.286 A:middle
So, networking on the watch can

00:10:06.286 --> 00:10:07.876 A:middle
be very expensive and so it's

00:10:07.876 --> 00:10:08.596 A:middle
important that you use

00:10:08.596 --> 00:10:10.626 A:middle
background session for any work

00:10:10.626 --> 00:10:11.806 A:middle
that you want to occur when the

00:10:11.806 --> 00:10:12.456 A:middle
screen is off.

00:10:13.566 --> 00:10:14.536 A:middle
You want to also use this for

00:10:14.536 --> 00:10:15.976 A:middle
complication updates or

00:10:15.976 --> 00:10:17.496 A:middle
background app refresh as well

00:10:17.496 --> 00:10:19.206 A:middle
and that's because you'll be

00:10:19.206 --> 00:10:20.196 A:middle
able to get runtime when the

00:10:20.196 --> 00:10:22.046 A:middle
task completes so it can go off

00:10:22.046 --> 00:10:23.576 A:middle
and doing your networking and

00:10:23.576 --> 00:10:26.836 A:middle
let you know when it's done.

00:10:27.036 --> 00:10:28.546 A:middle
So, to recap.

00:10:29.126 --> 00:10:30.256 A:middle
First, you want to identify the

00:10:30.256 --> 00:10:31.236 A:middle
work that you're doing.

00:10:31.236 --> 00:10:32.756 A:middle
This will help you ensure that

00:10:32.756 --> 00:10:33.366 A:middle
you're not repeating

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:34.756 A:middle
transactions again and again.

00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:36.566 A:middle
Next, you want to optimize your

00:10:36.566 --> 00:10:38.426 A:middle
work by using Background Session

00:10:38.426 --> 00:10:39.496 A:middle
wherever appropriate.

00:10:40.366 --> 00:10:41.366 A:middle
Next, you want to coalesce your

00:10:41.366 --> 00:10:41.576 A:middle
work.

00:10:41.906 --> 00:10:43.156 A:middle
Really batch those transactions

00:10:43.156 --> 00:10:45.256 A:middle
up to save that overhead.

00:10:45.826 --> 00:10:47.796 A:middle
And finally, reduce your work my

00:10:47.796 --> 00:10:49.656 A:middle
minimizing retries and setting

00:10:49.656 --> 00:10:50.576 A:middle
reasonable timeouts.

00:10:52.116 --> 00:10:54.036 A:middle
So that was networking.

00:10:54.376 --> 00:10:55.436 A:middle
Now I want to talk to you a

00:10:55.436 --> 00:10:56.866 A:middle
little bit about location.

00:10:57.426 --> 00:10:59.746 A:middle
And so as a developer, you have

00:10:59.746 --> 00:11:01.296 A:middle
many APIs to choose from when it

00:10:59.746 --> 00:11:01.296 A:middle
many APIs to choose from when it

00:11:01.296 --> 00:11:02.116 A:middle
comes to location.

00:11:02.596 --> 00:11:03.666 A:middle
But today I really want to focus

00:11:03.666 --> 00:11:05.376 A:middle
on the energy impact of these

00:11:05.376 --> 00:11:05.736 A:middle
APIs.

00:11:06.326 --> 00:11:10.226 A:middle
So to start off, let's talk

00:11:10.226 --> 00:11:11.406 A:middle
about if I wanted to add the

00:11:11.406 --> 00:11:13.936 A:middle
ability to add navigation to my

00:11:14.126 --> 00:11:14.696 A:middle
app.

00:11:15.226 --> 00:11:16.426 A:middle
To do this, I'll want to use

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:17.826 A:middle
continuous location updates and

00:11:18.126 --> 00:11:19.376 A:middle
the reason for that is I'll need

00:11:19.376 --> 00:11:20.826 A:middle
to know if the user deviates

00:11:20.826 --> 00:11:21.546 A:middle
from my course.

00:11:22.266 --> 00:11:23.496 A:middle
That way I can provide them new

00:11:23.496 --> 00:11:24.986 A:middle
instructions for how to get to

00:11:24.986 --> 00:11:25.676 A:middle
their destination.

00:11:26.206 --> 00:11:28.316 A:middle
But one thing you want to be

00:11:28.316 --> 00:11:30.096 A:middle
cautioned of is that this does

00:11:30.096 --> 00:11:30.866 A:middle
prevent the device from

00:11:30.866 --> 00:11:32.476 A:middle
sleeping, so it will have a high

00:11:32.476 --> 00:11:34.216 A:middle
energy impact on your users.

00:11:35.716 --> 00:11:37.596 A:middle
So really, as soon as your user

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:38.656 A:middle
gets to their destination,

00:11:39.066 --> 00:11:40.016 A:middle
you'll want to make sure you

00:11:40.016 --> 00:11:42.696 A:middle
stop these location updates and

00:11:42.696 --> 00:11:43.856 A:middle
make sure the device can sleep

00:11:43.856 --> 00:11:44.126 A:middle
again.

00:11:45.146 --> 00:11:46.036 A:middle
So let's take a look at how we

00:11:46.036 --> 00:11:46.866 A:middle
can do this.

00:11:47.346 --> 00:11:48.296 A:middle
First, we'll create a location

00:11:48.296 --> 00:11:48.746 A:middle
manager.

00:11:49.716 --> 00:11:50.836 A:middle
Then, we'll move on and we'll

00:11:50.836 --> 00:11:51.656 A:middle
set some properties.

00:11:51.656 --> 00:11:52.556 A:middle
And the property I really want

00:11:52.556 --> 00:11:54.436 A:middle
to focus on today is desired

00:11:54.436 --> 00:11:54.986 A:middle
accuracy.

00:11:55.326 --> 00:11:56.586 A:middle
Really think about the accuracy

00:11:56.586 --> 00:11:57.646 A:middle
that you need and the reason for

00:11:57.646 --> 00:11:59.736 A:middle
that is higher accuracy is

00:11:59.736 --> 00:12:00.356 A:middle
higher power.

00:11:59.736 --> 00:12:00.356 A:middle
higher power.

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:02.466 A:middle
So really make sure that you do

00:12:02.466 --> 00:12:03.586 A:middle
need that high accuracy if you

00:12:03.586 --> 00:12:04.296 A:middle
go ahead and set it.

00:12:04.296 --> 00:12:07.236 A:middle
And then next, you'll want to go

00:12:07.236 --> 00:12:08.576 A:middle
ahead and start updating

00:12:08.626 --> 00:12:09.086 A:middle
location.

00:12:09.526 --> 00:12:12.836 A:middle
Once you're done, for instance

00:12:12.836 --> 00:12:13.786 A:middle
as soon as the user gets to

00:12:13.786 --> 00:12:15.846 A:middle
their destination, stop updating

00:12:15.846 --> 00:12:17.816 A:middle
location, again so that you can

00:12:17.816 --> 00:12:18.976 A:middle
let the device go back to sleep.

00:12:22.376 --> 00:12:24.166 A:middle
So that was continuous location.

00:12:24.826 --> 00:12:25.816 A:middle
Now let's move on and talk about

00:12:25.816 --> 00:12:27.236 A:middle
some other APIs that will allow

00:12:27.236 --> 00:12:28.776 A:middle
your device to sleep more often.

00:12:29.756 --> 00:12:31.306 A:middle
The first one is request

00:12:31.306 --> 00:12:33.156 A:middle
Location and this allows the

00:12:33.156 --> 00:12:34.496 A:middle
ability to get the user's

00:12:34.606 --> 00:12:35.706 A:middle
current location, maybe if you

00:12:35.706 --> 00:12:38.486 A:middle
want to update content based on

00:12:38.696 --> 00:12:40.686 A:middle
their current location without

00:12:40.686 --> 00:12:41.636 A:middle
having to worry about calling

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.356 A:middle
start location and stop location

00:12:43.356 --> 00:12:46.286 A:middle
and managing calling both of

00:12:47.256 --> 00:12:47.376 A:middle
those.

00:12:47.576 --> 00:12:48.836 A:middle
Next, there is region

00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:49.336 A:middle
monitoring.

00:12:49.886 --> 00:12:50.896 A:middle
Region monitoring provides you

00:12:50.896 --> 00:12:52.376 A:middle
the ability to know, let's say,

00:12:52.376 --> 00:12:54.036 A:middle
if you want to update content

00:12:54.036 --> 00:12:55.316 A:middle
when the user arrives home.

00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:56.396 A:middle
You don't have to track their

00:12:56.396 --> 00:12:57.286 A:middle
location all the time.

00:12:57.356 --> 00:12:59.126 A:middle
You can just create a region and

00:12:59.126 --> 00:13:00.306 A:middle
when they cross that region,

00:12:59.126 --> 00:13:00.306 A:middle
when they cross that region,

00:13:00.306 --> 00:13:00.976 A:middle
you'll be able to get some

00:13:00.976 --> 00:13:02.886 A:middle
runtime to do your work.

00:13:04.256 --> 00:13:06.296 A:middle
Similarly is visit monitoring.

00:13:06.926 --> 00:13:08.016 A:middle
Visit monitoring allows you to

00:13:08.016 --> 00:13:09.476 A:middle
know when users go to frequently

00:13:09.476 --> 00:13:10.286 A:middle
visited locations.

00:13:10.896 --> 00:13:12.216 A:middle
You'll also get some runtime at

00:13:12.216 --> 00:13:13.386 A:middle
that time as well without having

00:13:13.386 --> 00:13:14.696 A:middle
to continuously track their

00:13:14.696 --> 00:13:15.166 A:middle
location.

00:13:15.716 --> 00:13:18.736 A:middle
You can set that up as follows.

00:13:19.256 --> 00:13:21.826 A:middle
And finally there's significant

00:13:21.826 --> 00:13:22.536 A:middle
location change.

00:13:22.536 --> 00:13:24.616 A:middle
So significant location change

00:13:24.836 --> 00:13:26.176 A:middle
can be used if you want to know

00:13:26.176 --> 00:13:27.566 A:middle
when the user is moving a

00:13:27.566 --> 00:13:29.146 A:middle
significant distance but you

00:13:29.146 --> 00:13:30.426 A:middle
don't want to use continuous

00:13:30.426 --> 00:13:31.706 A:middle
location because continuous

00:13:31.706 --> 00:13:33.006 A:middle
location prevents the device

00:13:33.006 --> 00:13:33.496 A:middle
from sleeping.

00:13:34.896 --> 00:13:36.516 A:middle
Significant location change

00:13:36.786 --> 00:13:37.786 A:middle
doesn't prevent the device from

00:13:37.786 --> 00:13:38.166 A:middle
sleeping.

00:13:38.346 --> 00:13:39.796 A:middle
It can still sleep between those

00:13:39.796 --> 00:13:40.266 A:middle
updates.

00:13:40.896 --> 00:13:41.666 A:middle
And so you can really make a

00:13:41.666 --> 00:13:43.126 A:middle
good optimization if you're able

00:13:43.126 --> 00:13:44.336 A:middle
to move from continuous location

00:13:44.336 --> 00:13:45.656 A:middle
to significant location change.

00:13:45.966 --> 00:13:47.036 A:middle
One example is maybe you have a

00:13:47.036 --> 00:13:47.526 A:middle
weather app.

00:13:47.806 --> 00:13:48.726 A:middle
You need to know when the user

00:13:48.726 --> 00:13:49.946 A:middle
moves significantly and update

00:13:50.226 --> 00:13:51.206 A:middle
the weather at those times.

00:13:52.526 --> 00:13:54.526 A:middle
And here is how you can set that

00:13:56.126 --> 00:13:56.216 A:middle
up.

00:13:56.466 --> 00:13:58.466 A:middle
So to summarize, first you want

00:13:58.466 --> 00:13:59.986 A:middle
to identify the accuracy level

00:13:59.986 --> 00:14:00.506 A:middle
that you need.

00:13:59.986 --> 00:14:00.506 A:middle
that you need.

00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:01.896 A:middle
Really think about do I need

00:14:01.896 --> 00:14:02.816 A:middle
that high accuracy.

00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:04.296 A:middle
And if you don't, use something

00:14:04.296 --> 00:14:04.566 A:middle
lower.

00:14:05.396 --> 00:14:06.986 A:middle
Next, you'll want to optimize

00:14:06.986 --> 00:14:08.276 A:middle
your work by using alternatives

00:14:08.276 --> 00:14:09.896 A:middle
to continuous location wherever

00:14:09.896 --> 00:14:10.916 A:middle
you can and wherever it makes

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:11.286 A:middle
sense.

00:14:12.356 --> 00:14:14.126 A:middle
Next, you'll want to reduce your

00:14:14.126 --> 00:14:15.676 A:middle
work by stopping location

00:14:15.676 --> 00:14:16.626 A:middle
updates as soon as you're done

00:14:16.626 --> 00:14:16.886 A:middle
with them.

00:14:17.296 --> 00:14:19.176 A:middle
Again, if you let those location

00:14:19.176 --> 00:14:20.306 A:middle
updates keep coming, you might

00:14:20.306 --> 00:14:20.946 A:middle
prevent the device from

00:14:20.946 --> 00:14:21.256 A:middle
sleeping.

00:14:22.156 --> 00:14:23.376 A:middle
And finally, you'll want to

00:14:23.376 --> 00:14:25.196 A:middle
coalesce your work by deferring

00:14:25.196 --> 00:14:26.006 A:middle
location updates.

00:14:26.146 --> 00:14:27.176 A:middle
Maybe in the future you'll need

00:14:27.176 --> 00:14:28.746 A:middle
that location, you'll really

00:14:28.746 --> 00:14:29.686 A:middle
need it and maybe you don't need

00:14:29.686 --> 00:14:30.036 A:middle
it right now.

00:14:30.546 --> 00:14:32.516 A:middle
So that was location.

00:14:33.626 --> 00:14:34.536 A:middle
Now I want to talk to you about

00:14:34.596 --> 00:14:35.086 A:middle
graphics.

00:14:35.456 --> 00:14:37.276 A:middle
And graphics can be very energy

00:14:37.276 --> 00:14:37.736 A:middle
intensive.

00:14:38.406 --> 00:14:40.926 A:middle
So here are some good guidelines

00:14:40.926 --> 00:14:41.346 A:middle
to follow.

00:14:42.156 --> 00:14:43.606 A:middle
First, you'll want to minimize

00:14:43.606 --> 00:14:45.626 A:middle
your screen updates, really

00:14:45.626 --> 00:14:46.576 A:middle
ensure that these are providing

00:14:46.576 --> 00:14:47.836 A:middle
needed changes for your user.

00:14:49.316 --> 00:14:50.236 A:middle
Next, you'll want to review your

00:14:50.236 --> 00:14:51.006 A:middle
blur usage.

00:14:51.356 --> 00:14:52.426 A:middle
If you're placing blurs on top

00:14:52.426 --> 00:14:53.586 A:middle
of updating elements, this is

00:14:53.586 --> 00:14:55.976 A:middle
very expensive for battery life.

00:14:57.206 --> 00:14:57.976 A:middle
So be very cautious of that.

00:15:00.046 --> 00:15:00.766 A:middle
So those are some general

00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:01.346 A:middle
guidelines.

00:15:01.606 --> 00:15:02.636 A:middle
Now let's talk specifically

00:15:02.636 --> 00:15:03.256 A:middle
about the Mac.

00:15:04.246 --> 00:15:05.136 A:middle
So if you're developing on the

00:15:05.136 --> 00:15:06.976 A:middle
Mac, you'll want to be aware

00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:08.386 A:middle
that some MacBooks have a

00:15:08.386 --> 00:15:10.416 A:middle
discrete GPU and this discrete

00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:12.156 A:middle
GPU is great at delivering

00:15:12.156 --> 00:15:13.316 A:middle
awesome graphics and awesome

00:15:13.316 --> 00:15:15.206 A:middle
performance for your users but

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:17.106 A:middle
it also has a high power cost

00:15:17.106 --> 00:15:18.406 A:middle
over the integrated GPU.

00:15:18.906 --> 00:15:20.266 A:middle
And so you'll really want to

00:15:20.266 --> 00:15:21.846 A:middle
make sure that you're only using

00:15:21.846 --> 00:15:23.366 A:middle
the discrete GPU when your

00:15:23.366 --> 00:15:24.486 A:middle
animation performance really

00:15:24.486 --> 00:15:26.856 A:middle
suffers over the integrated GPU,

00:15:27.366 --> 00:15:28.866 A:middle
or if the functionality isn't

00:15:28.866 --> 00:15:31.666 A:middle
provided there.

00:15:31.876 --> 00:15:32.586 A:middle
Additionally, if you're

00:15:33.116 --> 00:15:34.906 A:middle
developing on the Mac, you might

00:15:34.906 --> 00:15:37.256 A:middle
be using Metal or OpenGL.

00:15:37.356 --> 00:15:38.946 A:middle
And if you're using Metal,

00:15:39.306 --> 00:15:40.446 A:middle
you'll really want to be aware

00:15:40.446 --> 00:15:41.566 A:middle
that by just calling Create

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:42.796 A:middle
System Default Device, you're

00:15:42.796 --> 00:15:44.146 A:middle
going to trigger the Discrete

00:15:44.146 --> 00:15:45.106 A:middle
GPU automatically.

00:15:46.416 --> 00:15:47.226 A:middle
And so if you don't need the

00:15:47.226 --> 00:15:48.786 A:middle
discrete GPU, instead you'll

00:15:48.786 --> 00:15:50.366 A:middle
want to call Copy All Devices

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:52.136 A:middle
and pick that device with the

00:15:52.136 --> 00:15:53.306 A:middle
low power attribute set.

00:15:53.836 --> 00:15:54.756 A:middle
This will ensure that you can

00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:56.446 A:middle
use the integrated GPU whenever

00:15:56.446 --> 00:15:56.896 A:middle
possible.

00:15:57.426 --> 00:16:00.106 A:middle
For those of you that are

00:15:57.426 --> 00:16:00.106 A:middle
For those of you that are

00:16:00.106 --> 00:16:01.556 A:middle
developing using OpenGL, you'll

00:16:02.286 --> 00:16:03.656 A:middle
want to make sure that your app

00:16:03.656 --> 00:16:06.346 A:middle
is mux-aware by setting the

00:16:06.516 --> 00:16:07.836 A:middle
Automatic Graphics Switching

00:16:07.836 --> 00:16:09.046 A:middle
property either in your

00:16:09.046 --> 00:16:11.996 A:middle
Info.plist or using the sample

00:16:11.996 --> 00:16:12.296 A:middle
below.

00:16:13.686 --> 00:16:15.426 A:middle
And the reason for this is if

00:16:15.426 --> 00:16:16.866 A:middle
you don't need the discrete GPU,

00:16:16.966 --> 00:16:18.506 A:middle
you don't want to be the one to

00:16:18.506 --> 00:16:21.086 A:middle
keep it up and automatically you

00:16:21.086 --> 00:16:22.336 A:middle
will keep it up unless you set

00:16:22.796 --> 00:16:23.326 A:middle
this property.

00:16:23.776 --> 00:16:27.536 A:middle
So to summarize, first you'll

00:16:27.536 --> 00:16:29.266 A:middle
want to identify the work that

00:16:29.266 --> 00:16:30.776 A:middle
you need to do by looking at

00:16:30.776 --> 00:16:31.896 A:middle
your burry usage.

00:16:32.256 --> 00:16:33.046 A:middle
Make sure you're not placing

00:16:33.046 --> 00:16:34.046 A:middle
those blurs over updating

00:16:34.046 --> 00:16:34.526 A:middle
elements.

00:16:35.406 --> 00:16:36.506 A:middle
Next, you'll want to optimize

00:16:36.506 --> 00:16:36.846 A:middle
your work.

00:16:36.846 --> 00:16:38.616 A:middle
If you're developing on the Mac,

00:16:38.776 --> 00:16:40.076 A:middle
really ensure that you're only

00:16:40.076 --> 00:16:41.536 A:middle
using the discrete GPU whenever

00:16:41.536 --> 00:16:42.646 A:middle
you really need it to deliver

00:16:42.646 --> 00:16:43.646 A:middle
that great performance.

00:16:44.516 --> 00:16:46.366 A:middle
And finally, reduce your work by

00:16:46.366 --> 00:16:47.646 A:middle
minimizing screen updates

00:16:47.746 --> 00:16:48.456 A:middle
whenever possible.

00:16:49.036 --> 00:16:50.896 A:middle
So that was graphics.

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:52.126 A:middle
Now let's talk a little bit

00:16:52.126 --> 00:16:53.136 A:middle
about processing.

00:16:53.456 --> 00:16:54.546 A:middle
And again, processing can be

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:56.006 A:middle
very energy intensive as well.

00:16:56.086 --> 00:17:00.176 A:middle
So here are some guidelines to

00:16:56.086 --> 00:17:00.176 A:middle
So here are some guidelines to

00:17:00.176 --> 00:17:00.726 A:middle
follow.

00:17:01.036 --> 00:17:02.116 A:middle
First, you'll want to identify

00:17:02.116 --> 00:17:04.165 A:middle
the tasks that you need to do.

00:17:05.195 --> 00:17:06.205 A:middle
Next, you'll want to do that

00:17:06.205 --> 00:17:07.406 A:middle
work very quickly and

00:17:07.406 --> 00:17:08.286 A:middle
efficiently once you've

00:17:08.286 --> 00:17:09.316 A:middle
identified those tasks.

00:17:10.406 --> 00:17:11.675 A:middle
You'll also want to avoid timers

00:17:11.675 --> 00:17:12.415 A:middle
whenever possible.

00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:13.826 A:middle
Try to do your work based on

00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:16.215 A:middle
user interaction rather than a

00:17:16.215 --> 00:17:17.766 A:middle
fixed timer over and over again.

00:17:18.675 --> 00:17:20.126 A:middle
But if you really do need to use

00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:21.836 A:middle
those timers, try to set a

00:17:21.836 --> 00:17:22.705 A:middle
pretty long leeway.

00:17:22.705 --> 00:17:24.086 A:middle
That will let the system

00:17:24.086 --> 00:17:25.425 A:middle
coalesce your timers with other

00:17:25.425 --> 00:17:25.685 A:middle
work.

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:28.445 A:middle
So that was some general

00:17:28.445 --> 00:17:29.576 A:middle
guidelines for processing.

00:17:29.806 --> 00:17:31.016 A:middle
Today I really want to focus on

00:17:31.366 --> 00:17:32.376 A:middle
background processing.

00:17:33.436 --> 00:17:35.116 A:middle
And background processing can be

00:17:35.116 --> 00:17:36.896 A:middle
very expensive for your users

00:17:37.126 --> 00:17:38.116 A:middle
and so it's important to think

00:17:38.116 --> 00:17:39.256 A:middle
about what you're doing in the

00:17:39.256 --> 00:17:39.756 A:middle
background.

00:17:40.046 --> 00:17:41.496 A:middle
The main reason for this is the

00:17:41.496 --> 00:17:44.076 A:middle
user is not looking at your app.

00:17:44.806 --> 00:17:45.486 A:middle
In the foreground, they're

00:17:45.486 --> 00:17:46.226 A:middle
looking at your app.

00:17:46.226 --> 00:17:47.436 A:middle
So if you're using some energy

00:17:47.436 --> 00:17:49.276 A:middle
there, they might not be as

00:17:49.276 --> 00:17:49.566 A:middle
worried.

00:17:49.566 --> 00:17:50.456 A:middle
But if you're using a lot of

00:17:50.456 --> 00:17:51.736 A:middle
energy in the background, your

00:17:52.356 --> 00:17:53.836 A:middle
users might not be happy about

00:17:55.536 --> 00:17:55.646 A:middle
this.

00:17:55.806 --> 00:17:58.066 A:middle
And so here are some general

00:17:58.066 --> 00:17:58.506 A:middle
guidelines.

00:17:59.126 --> 00:18:00.286 A:middle
First, we'll want to finish our

00:17:59.126 --> 00:18:00.286 A:middle
First, we'll want to finish our

00:18:00.286 --> 00:18:01.556 A:middle
work as quickly as possible.

00:18:02.366 --> 00:18:03.716 A:middle
First think, do I really need to

00:18:03.716 --> 00:18:04.786 A:middle
do this work in the background.

00:18:05.036 --> 00:18:06.766 A:middle
And if so, find the most

00:18:06.766 --> 00:18:07.576 A:middle
efficient way to do it.

00:18:08.176 --> 00:18:09.486 A:middle
Next, if you want to update your

00:18:09.486 --> 00:18:11.386 A:middle
content, try to use the

00:18:11.386 --> 00:18:12.666 A:middle
background app refresh API.

00:18:13.666 --> 00:18:14.816 A:middle
This will really help you find

00:18:14.816 --> 00:18:15.996 A:middle
the best time to update your

00:18:15.996 --> 00:18:16.426 A:middle
content.

00:18:16.946 --> 00:18:19.816 A:middle
And finally, you'll want to make

00:18:19.816 --> 00:18:20.446 A:middle
sure that you call the

00:18:20.446 --> 00:18:22.136 A:middle
completion handler for whatever

00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:23.136 A:middle
API that you're using.

00:18:23.616 --> 00:18:24.606 A:middle
This will make sure that you

00:18:24.606 --> 00:18:25.806 A:middle
allow the device to sleep as

00:18:25.806 --> 00:18:27.026 A:middle
quickly as possible and you

00:18:27.026 --> 00:18:28.896 A:middle
don't end up paying any fixed

00:18:31.776 --> 00:18:31.936 A:middle
cost.

00:18:32.066 --> 00:18:35.386 A:middle
So new in iOS 11, there's a

00:18:35.386 --> 00:18:36.486 A:middle
completion handler in the

00:18:36.486 --> 00:18:37.096 A:middle
PushKit API.

00:18:37.936 --> 00:18:40.146 A:middle
This will allow the device to go

00:18:40.146 --> 00:18:41.626 A:middle
back to sleep very quickly after

00:18:41.626 --> 00:18:42.936 A:middle
you handle your incoming push if

00:18:42.936 --> 00:18:43.476 A:middle
you call this.

00:18:44.806 --> 00:18:45.756 A:middle
And so you'll really want to

00:18:45.756 --> 00:18:46.866 A:middle
make sure that you adopt this if

00:18:46.866 --> 00:18:47.546 A:middle
you're using PushKit.

00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:49.906 A:middle
And let's take a look at an

00:18:49.906 --> 00:18:50.366 A:middle
example.

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:53.766 A:middle
Here, we can see I'm not calling

00:18:54.246 --> 00:18:55.316 A:middle
the completion handler in this

00:18:55.316 --> 00:18:56.386 A:middle
case when I receive my incoming

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:56.756 A:middle
push.

00:18:56.916 --> 00:18:58.326 A:middle
I'm just doing some processing

00:18:58.326 --> 00:18:59.466 A:middle
and then I'm letting the device

00:18:59.926 --> 00:19:01.096 A:middle
just go to sleep after a fixed

00:18:59.926 --> 00:19:01.096 A:middle
just go to sleep after a fixed

00:19:01.096 --> 00:19:03.666 A:middle
period of time.

00:19:03.866 --> 00:19:05.976 A:middle
But now let's take a look at the

00:19:06.216 --> 00:19:07.386 A:middle
energy impact with the

00:19:07.386 --> 00:19:08.056 A:middle
optimization.

00:19:08.466 --> 00:19:09.346 A:middle
By calling the completion

00:19:09.346 --> 00:19:11.256 A:middle
handler, we are allowing the

00:19:11.256 --> 00:19:12.606 A:middle
device to sleep more quickly and

00:19:12.606 --> 00:19:14.156 A:middle
not only have we saved that

00:19:14.156 --> 00:19:15.426 A:middle
energy that we're using in the

00:19:15.426 --> 00:19:16.496 A:middle
background but also that

00:19:16.496 --> 00:19:17.466 A:middle
overhead cost as well.

00:19:17.596 --> 00:19:19.956 A:middle
That will really help the

00:19:19.956 --> 00:19:21.486 A:middle
battery life of your users if

00:19:21.486 --> 00:19:21.976 A:middle
you're using PushKit.

00:19:25.106 --> 00:19:26.116 A:middle
So let's talk a little bit about

00:19:26.116 --> 00:19:27.026 A:middle
background processing on the

00:19:27.026 --> 00:19:27.396 A:middle
Watch.

00:19:28.086 --> 00:19:30.786 A:middle
So new is the background

00:19:30.786 --> 00:19:31.636 A:middle
navigation mode.

00:19:32.196 --> 00:19:33.666 A:middle
This also has CPU limits like

00:19:33.666 --> 00:19:35.406 A:middle
other background modes on the

00:19:35.406 --> 00:19:35.766 A:middle
watch.

00:19:36.806 --> 00:19:38.236 A:middle
Additionally, you'll want to

00:19:38.236 --> 00:19:38.966 A:middle
really make sure that you

00:19:38.966 --> 00:19:40.206 A:middle
minimize any networking that

00:19:40.206 --> 00:19:41.866 A:middle
you're doing when in this

00:19:41.866 --> 00:19:42.466 A:middle
background mode.

00:19:42.716 --> 00:19:44.256 A:middle
Really think about, do I need to

00:19:44.256 --> 00:19:47.726 A:middle
do this or will my user care

00:19:48.336 --> 00:19:50.016 A:middle
about this networking update

00:19:50.016 --> 00:19:50.456 A:middle
that I'm doing.

00:19:51.676 --> 00:19:52.696 A:middle
Maybe do it for things like

00:19:52.966 --> 00:19:55.666 A:middle
traffic reroute or important

00:19:55.666 --> 00:19:56.386 A:middle
traffic information.

00:19:57.626 --> 00:19:59.766 A:middle
And finally, use background app

00:19:59.766 --> 00:20:01.266 A:middle
refresh and complication updates

00:19:59.766 --> 00:20:01.266 A:middle
refresh and complication updates

00:20:01.266 --> 00:20:02.106 A:middle
to update your data.

00:20:02.716 --> 00:20:04.006 A:middle
And when you're using these

00:20:04.006 --> 00:20:05.726 A:middle
APIs, make sure that you use

00:20:05.726 --> 00:20:06.786 A:middle
Background Session, as we talked

00:20:06.786 --> 00:20:08.446 A:middle
about earlier, to get that data

00:20:08.446 --> 00:20:09.396 A:middle
so you don't have to wait around

00:20:09.396 --> 00:20:10.956 A:middle
for the data to come through.

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:15.276 A:middle
So to summarize, first you'll

00:20:15.276 --> 00:20:16.316 A:middle
want to identify the work that

00:20:16.316 --> 00:20:17.256 A:middle
you're doing in the background.

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:19.436 A:middle
Really make sure it's providing

00:20:19.936 --> 00:20:22.536 A:middle
useful content for your user.

00:20:23.626 --> 00:20:24.596 A:middle
Next, you'll want to optimize

00:20:24.596 --> 00:20:25.666 A:middle
your work by using Background

00:20:25.666 --> 00:20:28.606 A:middle
App Refresh whenever you can.

00:20:28.826 --> 00:20:30.086 A:middle
Next, reduce your work by

00:20:30.086 --> 00:20:31.276 A:middle
limiting the transactions that

00:20:31.276 --> 00:20:32.206 A:middle
you're doing in the background.

00:20:33.176 --> 00:20:34.536 A:middle
And finally, using background

00:20:34.536 --> 00:20:36.176 A:middle
Session whenever possible.

00:20:38.496 --> 00:20:40.366 A:middle
So now my colleague is going to

00:20:40.366 --> 00:20:41.836 A:middle
come up and talk to you about

00:20:41.836 --> 00:20:43.016 A:middle
the energy tools available to

00:20:43.016 --> 00:20:43.886 A:middle
you as well as give you a demo.

00:20:44.516 --> 00:20:47.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:48.066 --> 00:20:48.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Daniel.

00:20:52.236 --> 00:20:53.256 A:middle
Good morning, everyone.

00:20:53.676 --> 00:20:54.956 A:middle
I am Prajakta Karandikar.

00:20:55.396 --> 00:20:56.666 A:middle
I'm an engineer in the power

00:20:56.666 --> 00:20:57.006 A:middle
team.

00:20:58.506 --> 00:21:00.116 A:middle
So you heard about all the best

00:20:58.506 --> 00:21:00.116 A:middle
So you heard about all the best

00:21:00.116 --> 00:21:01.696 A:middle
practices for writing energy

00:21:01.696 --> 00:21:02.406 A:middle
efficient code.

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:04.816 A:middle
Now I'm going to talk about the

00:21:04.816 --> 00:21:06.636 A:middle
various energy debugging tools

00:21:06.636 --> 00:21:07.576 A:middle
that we have developed.

00:21:08.576 --> 00:21:10.016 A:middle
We will see how you can use

00:21:10.016 --> 00:21:11.676 A:middle
these tools to measure the

00:21:11.676 --> 00:21:13.626 A:middle
energy efficiency or energy

00:21:13.626 --> 00:21:15.016 A:middle
impact of your applications.

00:21:16.196 --> 00:21:18.026 A:middle
These tools will help you find

00:21:18.346 --> 00:21:19.846 A:middle
the high-level problems within

00:21:19.846 --> 00:21:21.256 A:middle
your application pertaining to

00:21:21.256 --> 00:21:23.476 A:middle
energy or the major problem

00:21:23.476 --> 00:21:25.046 A:middle
areas and will help you fix

00:21:25.046 --> 00:21:25.876 A:middle
these problems.

00:21:26.946 --> 00:21:28.286 A:middle
Finally, we will move on to a

00:21:28.286 --> 00:21:30.366 A:middle
demo where I'll take some sample

00:21:30.366 --> 00:21:32.376 A:middle
applications and debug them for

00:21:32.376 --> 00:21:34.556 A:middle
energy issues using our new

00:21:34.616 --> 00:21:36.886 A:middle
tools so that it establishes a

00:21:36.886 --> 00:21:38.606 A:middle
debugging workflow for you to

00:21:38.606 --> 00:21:40.026 A:middle
debug your own applications.

00:21:40.686 --> 00:21:43.726 A:middle
But first, let us see why it is

00:21:43.726 --> 00:21:45.046 A:middle
important to measure your app's

00:21:45.046 --> 00:21:45.606 A:middle
efficiency.

00:21:46.686 --> 00:21:48.076 A:middle
Say you develop this awesome

00:21:48.076 --> 00:21:49.436 A:middle
application with some great

00:21:49.436 --> 00:21:50.926 A:middle
functionality but did not

00:21:50.926 --> 00:21:52.176 A:middle
measure its energy impact.

00:21:52.946 --> 00:21:54.836 A:middle
Turns out the energy impact of

00:21:54.836 --> 00:21:56.506 A:middle
the application is pretty high

00:21:57.026 --> 00:21:58.756 A:middle
even with usage for a very small

00:21:58.756 --> 00:21:59.596 A:middle
period of time.

00:22:00.726 --> 00:22:03.166 A:middle
Naturally, battery usage UI is

00:22:03.166 --> 00:22:04.596 A:middle
going to flag this application

00:22:04.596 --> 00:22:05.756 A:middle
as one of the top energy

00:22:05.756 --> 00:22:08.386 A:middle
drainers and any customer who is

00:22:08.386 --> 00:22:10.276 A:middle
using your application is going

00:22:10.276 --> 00:22:11.636 A:middle
to experience a significant

00:22:11.636 --> 00:22:13.146 A:middle
battery drain even with

00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:14.426 A:middle
small-usage periods.

00:22:15.266 --> 00:22:16.746 A:middle
It could be possible that the

00:22:16.746 --> 00:22:17.716 A:middle
customer deletes your

00:22:17.716 --> 00:22:19.306 A:middle
application and that is

00:22:19.306 --> 00:22:20.686 A:middle
definitely not something that

00:22:20.686 --> 00:22:21.326 A:middle
you desired.

00:22:22.356 --> 00:22:23.956 A:middle
So as an app developer, it is

00:22:23.956 --> 00:22:25.226 A:middle
really important that you

00:22:25.226 --> 00:22:27.066 A:middle
measure your app's efficiency

00:22:27.066 --> 00:22:28.626 A:middle
pertaining to energy or its

00:22:28.626 --> 00:22:29.546 A:middle
energy impact.

00:22:30.666 --> 00:22:31.786 A:middle
And to help you with this

00:22:31.786 --> 00:22:33.826 A:middle
measurement, we have the new and

00:22:33.826 --> 00:22:35.286 A:middle
improved Energy Gauges.

00:22:36.386 --> 00:22:37.856 A:middle
These are included as a part of

00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:39.276 A:middle
Xcode, which you all are

00:22:39.276 --> 00:22:40.056 A:middle
familiar with.

00:22:41.476 --> 00:22:43.416 A:middle
Energy Gauges are designed to

00:22:43.416 --> 00:22:45.066 A:middle
give you a high-level overview

00:22:45.406 --> 00:22:46.696 A:middle
of the problems within your

00:22:46.696 --> 00:22:47.926 A:middle
application pertaining to

00:22:47.926 --> 00:22:48.356 A:middle
energy.

00:22:49.046 --> 00:22:50.116 A:middle
They will tell you what are the

00:22:50.116 --> 00:22:52.066 A:middle
energy-heavy areas within your

00:22:52.066 --> 00:22:52.336 A:middle
app.

00:22:53.386 --> 00:22:55.116 A:middle
They will also guide you to the

00:22:55.116 --> 00:22:56.866 A:middle
right set of instruments to

00:22:56.866 --> 00:22:58.616 A:middle
drill down deeper within these

00:22:58.686 --> 00:23:00.586 A:middle
problem areas and fix these

00:22:58.686 --> 00:23:00.586 A:middle
problem areas and fix these

00:23:00.586 --> 00:23:01.246 A:middle
problems.

00:23:02.736 --> 00:23:04.876 A:middle
So where can you access Energy

00:23:04.876 --> 00:23:05.996 A:middle
Gauges within Xcode?

00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:08.536 A:middle
When you launch your application

00:23:08.536 --> 00:23:11.096 A:middle
with Xcode, click on the Debug

00:23:11.096 --> 00:23:11.786 A:middle
navigator.

00:23:12.916 --> 00:23:14.826 A:middle
A series of performance gauges

00:23:15.156 --> 00:23:16.386 A:middle
open to the left-hand side of

00:23:16.386 --> 00:23:16.956 A:middle
the screen.

00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:19.736 A:middle
These are for the basic metrics

00:23:19.776 --> 00:23:22.506 A:middle
in the system like CPU, memory,

00:23:22.906 --> 00:23:24.526 A:middle
network, and disk.

00:23:25.526 --> 00:23:28.056 A:middle
In iOS and macOS, one of these

00:23:28.056 --> 00:23:29.946 A:middle
gauges is for energy impact.

00:23:31.256 --> 00:23:32.746 A:middle
When you click on this energy

00:23:32.746 --> 00:23:35.206 A:middle
impact gauge, the energy report

00:23:35.526 --> 00:23:36.826 A:middle
opens to the right-hand side of

00:23:36.826 --> 00:23:37.356 A:middle
the screen.

00:23:38.516 --> 00:23:39.636 A:middle
Let me walk you through the

00:23:39.636 --> 00:23:41.126 A:middle
various parts of this report.

00:23:41.736 --> 00:23:44.906 A:middle
At the top left corner of the

00:23:44.936 --> 00:23:47.516 A:middle
report, you will see a value

00:23:48.006 --> 00:23:49.466 A:middle
which indicates the overall

00:23:49.466 --> 00:23:51.346 A:middle
energy rating or the overall

00:23:51.346 --> 00:23:52.416 A:middle
energy score for your

00:23:52.416 --> 00:23:53.126 A:middle
application.

00:23:54.476 --> 00:23:57.846 A:middle
Alongside it lies a meter which

00:23:57.846 --> 00:23:59.456 A:middle
is three regions: the green,

00:23:59.516 --> 00:24:01.376 A:middle
yellow, and the red region

00:23:59.516 --> 00:24:01.376 A:middle
yellow, and the red region

00:24:01.496 --> 00:24:03.226 A:middle
corresponding to low, high, and

00:24:03.226 --> 00:24:05.306 A:middle
very high energy impact.

00:24:05.856 --> 00:24:08.146 A:middle
So the bad news for this

00:24:08.146 --> 00:24:10.706 A:middle
particular report is that this

00:24:10.706 --> 00:24:11.906 A:middle
application which is being

00:24:11.906 --> 00:24:14.056 A:middle
debugged has a high average

00:24:14.056 --> 00:24:14.746 A:middle
energy impact.

00:24:16.016 --> 00:24:18.046 A:middle
The good news, however, is that

00:24:18.046 --> 00:24:19.496 A:middle
as you make improvements or

00:24:19.496 --> 00:24:20.586 A:middle
optimization to your

00:24:20.586 --> 00:24:23.006 A:middle
application, this meter will

00:24:23.006 --> 00:24:24.016 A:middle
help you know whether you're

00:24:24.016 --> 00:24:25.276 A:middle
moving in the right direction,

00:24:25.656 --> 00:24:27.216 A:middle
that is towards the green or the

00:24:27.216 --> 00:24:29.176 A:middle
low energy impact zone, or are

00:24:29.176 --> 00:24:30.126 A:middle
you moving to the wrong

00:24:30.126 --> 00:24:31.456 A:middle
direction, which is the red or

00:24:31.456 --> 00:24:32.706 A:middle
the very high energy impact

00:24:32.706 --> 00:24:33.036 A:middle
zone.

00:24:34.326 --> 00:24:35.366 A:middle
So if you see that your

00:24:35.366 --> 00:24:37.516 A:middle
application lies anywhere within

00:24:37.516 --> 00:24:39.176 A:middle
the yellow or the high regions,

00:24:39.886 --> 00:24:41.246 A:middle
you definitely want to take a

00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:43.176 A:middle
look at the pie chart which is

00:24:43.176 --> 00:24:44.586 A:middle
at the top right corner of the

00:24:44.586 --> 00:24:44.956 A:middle
report.

00:24:46.246 --> 00:24:48.266 A:middle
So this pie chart tells you what

00:24:48.266 --> 00:24:49.586 A:middle
does the average component

00:24:49.586 --> 00:24:51.756 A:middle
utilization for the primary

00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:53.826 A:middle
components which consume energy

00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:56.156 A:middle
on iOS as were described to you

00:24:56.156 --> 00:24:56.776 A:middle
by Daniel.

00:24:58.006 --> 00:25:00.386 A:middle
Ask yourself, do you expect your

00:24:58.006 --> 00:25:00.386 A:middle
Ask yourself, do you expect your

00:25:00.386 --> 00:25:02.236 A:middle
application to be using this

00:25:02.236 --> 00:25:04.626 A:middle
much CPU, GPU, networking,

00:25:04.626 --> 00:25:04.976 A:middle
location.

00:25:05.446 --> 00:25:09.116 A:middle
You can start by eliminating

00:25:09.336 --> 00:25:10.996 A:middle
whatever you did not expect your

00:25:10.996 --> 00:25:12.246 A:middle
application to be using.

00:25:12.846 --> 00:25:14.696 A:middle
Those could be some leaks within

00:25:14.696 --> 00:25:16.566 A:middle
your application which have left

00:25:16.566 --> 00:25:17.586 A:middle
some hardware running

00:25:17.586 --> 00:25:19.026 A:middle
indefinitely and which are

00:25:19.026 --> 00:25:20.576 A:middle
resulting in a greater energy

00:25:20.576 --> 00:25:21.046 A:middle
impact.

00:25:22.216 --> 00:25:24.246 A:middle
For example, say you have

00:25:24.246 --> 00:25:26.056 A:middle
developed a gaming application

00:25:26.416 --> 00:25:28.826 A:middle
which uses only the CPU and GPU

00:25:29.316 --> 00:25:30.936 A:middle
and it requires very little

00:25:30.936 --> 00:25:32.796 A:middle
location that is to access the

00:25:32.796 --> 00:25:34.046 A:middle
location of the user when the

00:25:34.046 --> 00:25:35.416 A:middle
user starts playing a game.

00:25:36.326 --> 00:25:38.196 A:middle
But if you see from the energy

00:25:38.196 --> 00:25:39.806 A:middle
report that the pie chart tells

00:25:39.806 --> 00:25:40.886 A:middle
you that your location

00:25:40.886 --> 00:25:42.996 A:middle
utilization is very high, that

00:25:43.046 --> 00:25:44.356 A:middle
could be a possible leak within

00:25:44.356 --> 00:25:46.306 A:middle
your application where you're

00:25:46.306 --> 00:25:48.216 A:middle
continuously accessing location

00:25:48.656 --> 00:25:50.086 A:middle
and that could be something

00:25:50.086 --> 00:25:51.436 A:middle
which is resulting in excessive

00:25:51.436 --> 00:25:52.166 A:middle
energy drain.

00:25:52.946 --> 00:25:55.426 A:middle
So once you have eliminated

00:25:55.426 --> 00:25:57.066 A:middle
whatever you did not expect your

00:25:57.066 --> 00:25:59.416 A:middle
application to be using, next

00:25:59.476 --> 00:26:00.896 A:middle
you should try to optimize

00:25:59.476 --> 00:26:00.896 A:middle
you should try to optimize

00:26:00.966 --> 00:26:02.886 A:middle
whatever stands out or is the

00:26:02.886 --> 00:26:04.266 A:middle
biggest portion within the pie

00:26:04.306 --> 00:26:04.616 A:middle
chart.

00:26:05.596 --> 00:26:07.316 A:middle
So for this particular example,

00:26:07.886 --> 00:26:09.736 A:middle
we see that the red region,

00:26:09.736 --> 00:26:11.316 A:middle
which stands for overhead, is

00:26:11.316 --> 00:26:12.456 A:middle
the biggest piece in the pie

00:26:12.516 --> 00:26:12.826 A:middle
chart.

00:26:13.816 --> 00:26:15.396 A:middle
We know that overhead is the

00:26:15.396 --> 00:26:17.716 A:middle
energy that is required to bring

00:26:17.716 --> 00:26:19.836 A:middle
up the radios and all the other

00:26:19.836 --> 00:26:21.436 A:middle
system hardware which is

00:26:21.436 --> 00:26:23.136 A:middle
required for your application to

00:26:23.136 --> 00:26:23.946 A:middle
perform work.

00:26:24.456 --> 00:26:26.156 A:middle
And this seems about right

00:26:26.156 --> 00:26:27.236 A:middle
considering that your

00:26:27.236 --> 00:26:29.276 A:middle
application is also utilizing

00:26:29.276 --> 00:26:30.406 A:middle
the networking component.

00:26:31.086 --> 00:26:32.436 A:middle
Networking is going to bring up

00:26:32.436 --> 00:26:34.566 A:middle
the radios which will require

00:26:34.566 --> 00:26:36.246 A:middle
power for prolonged periods.

00:26:37.356 --> 00:26:38.806 A:middle
So in this case you can try to

00:26:38.806 --> 00:26:40.396 A:middle
optimize your networking

00:26:40.396 --> 00:26:41.316 A:middle
utilization.

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:43.096 A:middle
Try to batch up all your

00:26:43.096 --> 00:26:44.526 A:middle
networking activity within your

00:26:44.526 --> 00:26:46.766 A:middle
application whenever possible so

00:26:46.766 --> 00:26:48.506 A:middle
that it reduces the impact on

00:26:48.506 --> 00:26:50.176 A:middle
the networking as well as the

00:26:50.176 --> 00:26:51.966 A:middle
corresponding overhead which has

00:26:51.966 --> 00:26:54.286 A:middle
resulted from it.

00:26:54.566 --> 00:26:55.776 A:middle
Once you know which is the

00:26:55.776 --> 00:26:57.306 A:middle
primary component that you want

00:26:57.306 --> 00:26:58.836 A:middle
to try to optimize or improve

00:26:58.836 --> 00:27:00.426 A:middle
first within your application,

00:26:58.836 --> 00:27:00.426 A:middle
first within your application,

00:27:01.336 --> 00:27:02.406 A:middle
you should look into the

00:27:02.406 --> 00:27:03.826 A:middle
segmented bar chart or the

00:27:03.826 --> 00:27:05.116 A:middle
instantaneous section of the

00:27:05.116 --> 00:27:05.556 A:middle
report.

00:27:06.836 --> 00:27:08.326 A:middle
This gets refreshed every

00:27:08.326 --> 00:27:08.796 A:middle
second.

00:27:09.836 --> 00:27:11.726 A:middle
This is great to find whether

00:27:11.726 --> 00:27:13.756 A:middle
what your application is doing

00:27:13.756 --> 00:27:15.426 A:middle
over time makes sense.

00:27:15.826 --> 00:27:18.216 A:middle
So when you execute certain

00:27:18.216 --> 00:27:19.896 A:middle
actions or scenarios while

00:27:19.896 --> 00:27:20.886 A:middle
you're trying to debug your

00:27:20.886 --> 00:27:22.666 A:middle
application using energy gauges,

00:27:23.406 --> 00:27:25.536 A:middle
you can see here what is the

00:27:25.536 --> 00:27:27.526 A:middle
exact point of time when you

00:27:27.526 --> 00:27:29.886 A:middle
consumed energy, which are the

00:27:29.886 --> 00:27:31.636 A:middle
various components on which you

00:27:31.636 --> 00:27:32.776 A:middle
generated a workload.

00:27:34.106 --> 00:27:35.736 A:middle
This region also tells you

00:27:36.046 --> 00:27:37.226 A:middle
whether that workload was

00:27:37.226 --> 00:27:39.026 A:middle
generated while the application

00:27:39.026 --> 00:27:40.766 A:middle
was running in the foreground,

00:27:40.906 --> 00:27:43.136 A:middle
background, or suspended states.

00:27:44.096 --> 00:27:45.586 A:middle
So here you can verify whether

00:27:45.586 --> 00:27:46.736 A:middle
you're adhering to the good

00:27:46.736 --> 00:27:49.016 A:middle
principles of doing as little

00:27:49.016 --> 00:27:51.286 A:middle
work as possible or no work if

00:27:51.286 --> 00:27:52.806 A:middle
possible in the background state

00:27:53.156 --> 00:27:54.666 A:middle
and moving immediately into the

00:27:54.666 --> 00:27:56.446 A:middle
suspected state whenever your

00:27:56.446 --> 00:27:57.436 A:middle
app is backgrounded.

00:27:57.956 --> 00:28:01.666 A:middle
If you do an extended click on

00:27:57.956 --> 00:28:01.666 A:middle
If you do an extended click on

00:28:01.666 --> 00:28:03.866 A:middle
any one of these bar charts, it

00:28:03.866 --> 00:28:05.466 A:middle
will give you a breakdown of the

00:28:05.466 --> 00:28:07.276 A:middle
component utilization for that

00:28:07.276 --> 00:28:07.816 A:middle
instant.

00:28:09.146 --> 00:28:11.366 A:middle
So this section is great to find

00:28:11.666 --> 00:28:13.046 A:middle
what are the opportunities

00:28:13.046 --> 00:28:14.956 A:middle
within your application to

00:28:14.956 --> 00:28:17.026 A:middle
reduce or to coalesce work.

00:28:18.126 --> 00:28:20.196 A:middle
In this particular example, you

00:28:20.196 --> 00:28:21.816 A:middle
see that you're repeatedly doing

00:28:21.816 --> 00:28:23.716 A:middle
networking activity and that's

00:28:23.786 --> 00:28:25.386 A:middle
why time and time again you have

00:28:25.386 --> 00:28:27.066 A:middle
the networking impact as well as

00:28:27.066 --> 00:28:28.346 A:middle
the overhead impact which is

00:28:28.346 --> 00:28:29.216 A:middle
generating from it.

00:28:29.846 --> 00:28:31.726 A:middle
So this is a great example that

00:28:31.726 --> 00:28:32.596 A:middle
you can batch all your

00:28:32.596 --> 00:28:34.116 A:middle
networking work and that is

00:28:34.116 --> 00:28:35.796 A:middle
going to lower the energy impact

00:28:35.796 --> 00:28:36.826 A:middle
for your application.

00:28:37.336 --> 00:28:42.176 A:middle
At the bottom of the report, you

00:28:42.176 --> 00:28:43.936 A:middle
have information regarding the

00:28:43.936 --> 00:28:45.956 A:middle
various components which consume

00:28:45.956 --> 00:28:48.206 A:middle
energy on iOS and some useful

00:28:48.206 --> 00:28:49.876 A:middle
tips regarding how you can

00:28:49.876 --> 00:28:51.816 A:middle
reduce your application's impact

00:28:52.236 --> 00:28:53.866 A:middle
on each one of these components.

00:28:55.496 --> 00:28:56.896 A:middle
To the right of these tips,

00:28:57.216 --> 00:28:58.576 A:middle
there are buttons to click into

00:28:58.576 --> 00:28:59.296 A:middle
instruments.

00:29:00.346 --> 00:29:02.066 A:middle
So say from the energy gauge's

00:29:02.066 --> 00:29:04.876 A:middle
report, you saw the CPU

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:06.826 A:middle
utilization for your application

00:29:06.826 --> 00:29:08.916 A:middle
is maximum and that is something

00:29:08.916 --> 00:29:09.766 A:middle
that you want to try to

00:29:09.766 --> 00:29:10.486 A:middle
optimize.

00:29:11.086 --> 00:29:12.716 A:middle
So you can click on the Time

00:29:12.716 --> 00:29:14.836 A:middle
Profiler instrument and this

00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:16.336 A:middle
will move your debugging session

00:29:16.686 --> 00:29:18.486 A:middle
into instruments time profiler.

00:29:19.366 --> 00:29:21.436 A:middle
So Time Profiler basically

00:29:21.436 --> 00:29:23.156 A:middle
watches all the running threads

00:29:23.156 --> 00:29:25.566 A:middle
of your process and it generates

00:29:25.776 --> 00:29:27.956 A:middle
samples at regular intervals.

00:29:28.806 --> 00:29:30.176 A:middle
You have a complete back-trace

00:29:30.176 --> 00:29:31.586 A:middle
available for each of these

00:29:31.586 --> 00:29:33.946 A:middle
samples and that can be seen on

00:29:33.946 --> 00:29:34.986 A:middle
the right-hand side in the

00:29:34.986 --> 00:29:36.166 A:middle
Extended View section.

00:29:37.146 --> 00:29:38.846 A:middle
So this helps you find what are

00:29:38.846 --> 00:29:40.656 A:middle
the exact lines of code within

00:29:40.656 --> 00:29:42.626 A:middle
your application which are

00:29:42.626 --> 00:29:45.296 A:middle
extremely time intensive, where

00:29:45.296 --> 00:29:46.916 A:middle
was most time spent within your

00:29:46.916 --> 00:29:49.146 A:middle
application, which functions

00:29:49.146 --> 00:29:50.456 A:middle
within your application were

00:29:50.456 --> 00:29:52.716 A:middle
extremely CPU intensive, and you

00:29:52.716 --> 00:29:54.536 A:middle
can try to optimize that part of

00:29:54.566 --> 00:29:57.186 A:middle
your code and rerun it for

00:29:57.186 --> 00:29:58.726 A:middle
debugging using Energy Gauges.

00:30:00.926 --> 00:30:03.166 A:middle
Similarly, if Energy Gauges

00:30:03.166 --> 00:30:04.506 A:middle
report told you that your

00:30:04.506 --> 00:30:05.916 A:middle
location utilization is

00:30:06.076 --> 00:30:07.966 A:middle
extremely high and that is

00:30:07.966 --> 00:30:09.106 A:middle
something that you want to go

00:30:09.106 --> 00:30:11.336 A:middle
and optimize, you can click on

00:30:11.336 --> 00:30:12.676 A:middle
the Location Profiler.

00:30:13.836 --> 00:30:15.726 A:middle
This tells you what are the

00:30:15.776 --> 00:30:17.536 A:middle
points in code where you have

00:30:17.536 --> 00:30:19.356 A:middle
made access to core location

00:30:19.356 --> 00:30:19.876 A:middle
manager.

00:30:21.106 --> 00:30:22.676 A:middle
You can also see what was the

00:30:22.676 --> 00:30:24.576 A:middle
accuracy that is demanded for

00:30:24.576 --> 00:30:26.696 A:middle
each of these calls and what is

00:30:26.696 --> 00:30:28.546 A:middle
the resulting energy impact from

00:30:28.546 --> 00:30:29.266 A:middle
these calls.

00:30:30.036 --> 00:30:32.206 A:middle
So in this particular case, we

00:30:32.206 --> 00:30:34.356 A:middle
see that the location manager is

00:30:34.356 --> 00:30:35.726 A:middle
being accessed time and time

00:30:35.726 --> 00:30:37.716 A:middle
again with the best accuracy

00:30:37.716 --> 00:30:39.436 A:middle
possible and, hence, there is a

00:30:39.436 --> 00:30:40.936 A:middle
high energy impact that is

00:30:40.936 --> 00:30:42.196 A:middle
resulting from each of these

00:30:42.196 --> 00:30:43.166 A:middle
location calls.

00:30:44.426 --> 00:30:45.996 A:middle
This is also a great place to

00:30:45.996 --> 00:30:47.696 A:middle
find out whether you have left

00:30:47.696 --> 00:30:48.926 A:middle
any leaks in the system.

00:30:49.476 --> 00:30:51.126 A:middle
That is whether all calls to

00:30:51.126 --> 00:30:52.476 A:middle
locations manager have been

00:30:52.476 --> 00:30:53.656 A:middle
successfully released.

00:30:54.896 --> 00:30:56.846 A:middle
You can also try to incorporate

00:30:56.846 --> 00:30:59.266 A:middle
the good practice of using lower

00:30:59.266 --> 00:31:00.976 A:middle
accuracy whenever possible

00:30:59.266 --> 00:31:00.976 A:middle
accuracy whenever possible

00:31:00.976 --> 00:31:03.016 A:middle
within your application so that

00:31:03.016 --> 00:31:04.696 A:middle
it lowers the energy impact

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:05.556 A:middle
resulting from it.

00:31:05.846 --> 00:31:09.996 A:middle
Now that we have familiarized

00:31:09.996 --> 00:31:11.996 A:middle
our self with the various tools

00:31:12.026 --> 00:31:13.416 A:middle
that are available for energy

00:31:13.416 --> 00:31:15.636 A:middle
debugging, let us look at some

00:31:15.636 --> 00:31:17.086 A:middle
of the scenarios that you should

00:31:17.086 --> 00:31:18.736 A:middle
execute on your applications

00:31:19.126 --> 00:31:20.786 A:middle
while debugging them for energy

00:31:20.786 --> 00:31:21.236 A:middle
issues.

00:31:22.586 --> 00:31:24.336 A:middle
So there are some scenarios that

00:31:24.406 --> 00:31:25.466 A:middle
could apply to every

00:31:25.466 --> 00:31:26.206 A:middle
application.

00:31:26.646 --> 00:31:28.786 A:middle
For example, there is the launch

00:31:28.786 --> 00:31:30.206 A:middle
and idle scenario, whether the

00:31:30.206 --> 00:31:31.926 A:middle
user launches your application

00:31:31.926 --> 00:31:33.296 A:middle
but does not interact with it.

00:31:34.266 --> 00:31:35.126 A:middle
Secondly, there is a

00:31:35.126 --> 00:31:36.236 A:middle
backgrounding scenario.

00:31:36.666 --> 00:31:38.486 A:middle
So you should try to run these

00:31:38.486 --> 00:31:40.236 A:middle
scenarios using Energy Gauges

00:31:40.456 --> 00:31:41.786 A:middle
and see what is the resulting

00:31:41.786 --> 00:31:43.956 A:middle
energy impact that is generated

00:31:43.956 --> 00:31:45.686 A:middle
from performing these actions on

00:31:45.686 --> 00:31:46.546 A:middle
your application.

00:31:47.996 --> 00:31:50.096 A:middle
Next, depending on the type of

00:31:50.126 --> 00:31:51.456 A:middle
application that you are

00:31:51.456 --> 00:31:53.016 A:middle
developing, there will be

00:31:53.016 --> 00:31:54.506 A:middle
certain application-specific

00:31:54.506 --> 00:31:55.046 A:middle
scenarios.

00:31:56.006 --> 00:31:57.966 A:middle
For example, if you're

00:31:57.966 --> 00:31:59.406 A:middle
developing a navigation app,

00:31:59.906 --> 00:32:01.266 A:middle
some scenarios that would be

00:31:59.906 --> 00:32:01.266 A:middle
some scenarios that would be

00:32:01.266 --> 00:32:02.856 A:middle
specific to your application

00:32:03.436 --> 00:32:04.846 A:middle
would be looking for a

00:32:04.846 --> 00:32:06.686 A:middle
particular location or address

00:32:07.156 --> 00:32:08.636 A:middle
and then getting the directions

00:32:08.636 --> 00:32:10.576 A:middle
for that address and actually

00:32:10.576 --> 00:32:11.946 A:middle
navigating to that particular

00:32:11.946 --> 00:32:12.506 A:middle
location.

00:32:13.276 --> 00:32:14.986 A:middle
So you should try running these

00:32:15.026 --> 00:32:17.726 A:middle
scenarios on energy gauges for

00:32:17.726 --> 00:32:19.706 A:middle
your applications, see what is

00:32:19.706 --> 00:32:21.266 A:middle
the corresponding energy impact,

00:32:21.896 --> 00:32:23.646 A:middle
then try to make improvements or

00:32:23.646 --> 00:32:25.236 A:middle
optimization when you find the

00:32:25.236 --> 00:32:26.626 A:middle
major problems pertaining to

00:32:26.626 --> 00:32:28.856 A:middle
energy and then rerun these

00:32:28.856 --> 00:32:30.726 A:middle
scenarios to ensure that Energy

00:32:30.726 --> 00:32:32.076 A:middle
Gauges tells you that you're

00:32:32.076 --> 00:32:33.666 A:middle
moving towards the lower energy

00:32:33.666 --> 00:32:35.106 A:middle
impact or the green zone.

00:32:36.236 --> 00:32:38.126 A:middle
So with that, let me move on to

00:32:38.126 --> 00:32:40.156 A:middle
a demo where we'll try to run

00:32:40.156 --> 00:32:41.716 A:middle
these scenarios on some sample

00:32:41.716 --> 00:32:43.476 A:middle
applications so that it

00:32:43.476 --> 00:32:45.386 A:middle
establishes a debugging workflow

00:32:45.386 --> 00:32:46.646 A:middle
for you to debug your own set of

00:32:46.646 --> 00:32:46.976 A:middle
applications.

00:32:53.156 --> 00:32:55.576 A:middle
So the first application that

00:32:55.576 --> 00:32:57.356 A:middle
I'm going to try to debug is

00:32:57.356 --> 00:32:58.166 A:middle
DemoBots.

00:32:59.156 --> 00:33:01.266 A:middle
So let me launch DemoBots on my

00:32:59.156 --> 00:33:01.266 A:middle
So let me launch DemoBots on my

00:33:01.266 --> 00:33:02.776 A:middle
device using Xcode.

00:33:03.536 --> 00:33:05.666 A:middle
So this is a simple game that we

00:33:05.666 --> 00:33:06.386 A:middle
have developed.

00:33:06.996 --> 00:33:08.286 A:middle
We expect the game to be

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:10.886 A:middle
utilizing only the CPU and GPU.

00:33:11.446 --> 00:33:13.626 A:middle
Let me click on the Debug

00:33:13.626 --> 00:33:15.856 A:middle
Navigator and click on the

00:33:15.856 --> 00:33:16.886 A:middle
Energy Impact gauge.

00:33:16.886 --> 00:33:20.076 A:middle
This is the first scenario that

00:33:20.076 --> 00:33:21.596 A:middle
we're executing, which is the

00:33:21.596 --> 00:33:22.756 A:middle
launch and idle scenario.

00:33:23.616 --> 00:33:24.846 A:middle
You want to see what is the

00:33:24.846 --> 00:33:26.506 A:middle
corresponding energy impact from

00:33:26.506 --> 00:33:28.486 A:middle
executing this action on the

00:33:28.486 --> 00:33:29.166 A:middle
application.

00:33:29.866 --> 00:33:32.476 A:middle
So here, we see that the overall

00:33:32.476 --> 00:33:34.776 A:middle
score for our application is

00:33:34.776 --> 00:33:35.146 A:middle
high.

00:33:35.406 --> 00:33:36.886 A:middle
That is it has high average

00:33:36.886 --> 00:33:37.706 A:middle
energy impact.

00:33:38.566 --> 00:33:40.196 A:middle
So next, we want to see what are

00:33:40.196 --> 00:33:41.166 A:middle
the components that we are

00:33:41.166 --> 00:33:42.106 A:middle
trying to utilize.

00:33:42.776 --> 00:33:44.166 A:middle
As expected, we are only

00:33:44.166 --> 00:33:45.966 A:middle
utilizing the CPU and GPU.

00:33:46.056 --> 00:33:47.136 A:middle
There are no unexpected

00:33:47.136 --> 00:33:48.496 A:middle
components being utilized, which

00:33:48.496 --> 00:33:48.976 A:middle
is great.

00:33:49.956 --> 00:33:51.566 A:middle
So next, let us look at which is

00:33:51.566 --> 00:33:53.226 A:middle
the largest part of this pie

00:33:53.276 --> 00:33:54.856 A:middle
chart and what it is that we can

00:33:54.856 --> 00:33:55.826 A:middle
optimize first.

00:33:56.766 --> 00:33:58.886 A:middle
So we see that our GPU component

00:33:58.886 --> 00:34:00.716 A:middle
is being extensively used at

00:33:58.886 --> 00:34:00.716 A:middle
is being extensively used at

00:34:00.716 --> 00:34:01.986 A:middle
about 88%.

00:34:02.526 --> 00:34:04.276 A:middle
So if you try to bring about any

00:34:04.276 --> 00:34:06.416 A:middle
optimization or improvement

00:34:06.416 --> 00:34:08.846 A:middle
within the GPU in your usage in

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:10.656 A:middle
your application, that is going

00:34:10.656 --> 00:34:12.166 A:middle
to give you maximum benefits.

00:34:13.246 --> 00:34:14.616 A:middle
Some of the good principles that

00:34:14.616 --> 00:34:16.126 A:middle
you could adhere to here are

00:34:16.696 --> 00:34:18.235 A:middle
reducing the number of screen

00:34:18.235 --> 00:34:21.045 A:middle
updates or reviewing your usage

00:34:21.045 --> 00:34:24.636 A:middle
of blurs or using less opacity

00:34:24.636 --> 00:34:25.606 A:middle
whenever possible.

00:34:26.416 --> 00:34:27.686 A:middle
And this could bring down your

00:34:27.686 --> 00:34:29.576 A:middle
GPU utilization and the

00:34:29.576 --> 00:34:31.255 A:middle
corresponding energy impact

00:34:31.255 --> 00:34:32.706 A:middle
generating from it.

00:34:33.696 --> 00:34:35.366 A:middle
Now let us perform another

00:34:35.366 --> 00:34:37.335 A:middle
scenario which is backgrounding.

00:34:37.886 --> 00:34:39.286 A:middle
Let me try to background this

00:34:39.286 --> 00:34:40.016 A:middle
application.

00:34:41.226 --> 00:34:42.496 A:middle
So we want to see whether it

00:34:42.496 --> 00:34:43.706 A:middle
moves into the backgrounding

00:34:43.706 --> 00:34:45.326 A:middle
state or immediately moves to

00:34:45.326 --> 00:34:46.306 A:middle
the suspended state.

00:34:47.156 --> 00:34:48.596 A:middle
So in this particular case, the

00:34:48.666 --> 00:34:50.306 A:middle
application is immediately moved

00:34:50.376 --> 00:34:52.246 A:middle
to the suspended state, which is

00:34:52.246 --> 00:34:54.085 A:middle
great, because that lets the

00:34:54.085 --> 00:34:55.556 A:middle
device actually sleep.

00:34:56.235 --> 00:34:57.726 A:middle
And you're not incurring any

00:34:57.726 --> 00:34:59.366 A:middle
energy cost on your device.

00:35:00.696 --> 00:35:02.826 A:middle
Let us shift gears and move to

00:35:02.826 --> 00:35:04.086 A:middle
another application.

00:35:05.386 --> 00:35:06.786 A:middle
The second application that we

00:35:06.786 --> 00:35:08.186 A:middle
are going to try to debug here

00:35:09.406 --> 00:35:10.456 A:middle
is EnergyBuddy.

00:35:10.966 --> 00:35:14.846 A:middle
Let me launch EnergyBuddy on my

00:35:14.846 --> 00:35:16.066 A:middle
device using Xcode.

00:35:17.226 --> 00:35:18.586 A:middle
So this is a simple application

00:35:18.586 --> 00:35:20.016 A:middle
which we have developed which

00:35:20.016 --> 00:35:21.726 A:middle
lets you take pictures of energy

00:35:21.726 --> 00:35:22.166 A:middle
meters.

00:35:23.026 --> 00:35:25.606 A:middle
It gets the reading from that

00:35:25.766 --> 00:35:26.866 A:middle
picture for the meter.

00:35:27.586 --> 00:35:28.976 A:middle
It then accesses your core

00:35:28.976 --> 00:35:31.086 A:middle
location and uses your location

00:35:31.086 --> 00:35:32.396 A:middle
to get the weather for that

00:35:32.396 --> 00:35:33.376 A:middle
particular location.

00:35:33.916 --> 00:35:35.826 A:middle
All of this information is later

00:35:35.826 --> 00:35:37.166 A:middle
stored in the database, which

00:35:37.166 --> 00:35:37.826 A:middle
you can retrieve.

00:35:38.406 --> 00:35:41.056 A:middle
So let me click on the Debug

00:35:41.056 --> 00:35:43.156 A:middle
Navigator and go to the Memory

00:35:43.156 --> 00:35:46.006 A:middle
Impact gauge, sorry, the Energy

00:35:46.006 --> 00:35:48.156 A:middle
Impact gauge.

00:35:48.156 --> 00:35:49.126 A:middle
So here, this is our first

00:35:49.126 --> 00:35:50.596 A:middle
scenario that we're executing,

00:35:51.056 --> 00:35:52.216 A:middle
which is the launch and idle.

00:35:53.016 --> 00:35:55.556 A:middle
So our -- From here, we see that

00:35:55.556 --> 00:35:56.856 A:middle
right now our energy impact is

00:35:56.856 --> 00:35:58.026 A:middle
zero, which is great.

00:35:58.196 --> 00:35:59.806 A:middle
The only component that we are

00:35:59.806 --> 00:36:01.896 A:middle
utilizing is CPU that was

00:35:59.806 --> 00:36:01.896 A:middle
utilizing is CPU that was

00:36:01.896 --> 00:36:03.166 A:middle
required for the launch.

00:36:03.716 --> 00:36:05.496 A:middle
Now let us perform one

00:36:05.496 --> 00:36:07.186 A:middle
application-specific scenario.

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:10.416 A:middle
Let me try to import a photo and

00:36:10.416 --> 00:36:11.906 A:middle
see what is the corresponding

00:36:12.686 --> 00:36:14.136 A:middle
impact from this particular

00:36:14.136 --> 00:36:16.106 A:middle
action being executed on my

00:36:16.106 --> 00:36:16.816 A:middle
application.

00:36:18.096 --> 00:36:19.816 A:middle
So when I import a photo, I'm

00:36:19.976 --> 00:36:21.206 A:middle
going to accept one of the

00:36:21.206 --> 00:36:24.266 A:middle
photos and allow EnergyBuddy to

00:36:24.266 --> 00:36:25.296 A:middle
access location.

00:36:26.846 --> 00:36:28.526 A:middle
So this generates a graph from

00:36:28.526 --> 00:36:29.726 A:middle
the meter reading that it has

00:36:29.726 --> 00:36:30.076 A:middle
got.

00:36:31.296 --> 00:36:32.406 A:middle
So as we see in the

00:36:32.406 --> 00:36:34.586 A:middle
instantaneous section here, on

00:36:34.586 --> 00:36:35.916 A:middle
executing this particular

00:36:35.916 --> 00:36:38.956 A:middle
action, my application is

00:36:38.956 --> 00:36:41.646 A:middle
utilizing CPU for processing and

00:36:41.646 --> 00:36:43.496 A:middle
it is also utilizing the

00:36:43.496 --> 00:36:44.566 A:middle
location component.

00:36:45.896 --> 00:36:47.926 A:middle
So this was expected because we

00:36:47.926 --> 00:36:49.906 A:middle
wanted as soon as we import this

00:36:49.906 --> 00:36:51.736 A:middle
particular photo, it takes the

00:36:51.736 --> 00:36:53.696 A:middle
location and then uses that

00:36:53.696 --> 00:36:54.766 A:middle
location to get the weather

00:36:54.766 --> 00:36:55.396 A:middle
information.

00:36:56.596 --> 00:36:58.776 A:middle
However, here we can see that it

00:36:58.776 --> 00:37:00.426 A:middle
is continuously accessing core

00:36:58.776 --> 00:37:00.426 A:middle
is continuously accessing core

00:37:00.456 --> 00:37:02.646 A:middle
location and that could be a

00:37:02.646 --> 00:37:04.846 A:middle
leak within my code where I have

00:37:04.846 --> 00:37:06.736 A:middle
left accessing core location

00:37:06.736 --> 00:37:07.516 A:middle
continuously.

00:37:08.076 --> 00:37:09.226 A:middle
So that is something that you

00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:11.096 A:middle
can fix within your application

00:37:11.586 --> 00:37:12.946 A:middle
and then try to rerun this

00:37:12.986 --> 00:37:14.556 A:middle
particular scenario of importing

00:37:14.556 --> 00:37:16.666 A:middle
a photo to ensure that your

00:37:16.666 --> 00:37:18.346 A:middle
energy impact has gone down.

00:37:20.196 --> 00:37:22.016 A:middle
So now let us try backgrounding

00:37:22.016 --> 00:37:22.856 A:middle
this application.

00:37:24.426 --> 00:37:25.496 A:middle
So when I background this

00:37:25.496 --> 00:37:27.306 A:middle
application, we want it to move

00:37:27.306 --> 00:37:28.906 A:middle
into the suspended state as soon

00:37:28.906 --> 00:37:29.606 A:middle
as possible.

00:37:30.946 --> 00:37:33.006 A:middle
However, here we see that the

00:37:33.006 --> 00:37:34.536 A:middle
application has moved to the

00:37:34.536 --> 00:37:36.316 A:middle
background state and it

00:37:36.376 --> 00:37:38.296 A:middle
continues to access location

00:37:38.296 --> 00:37:39.526 A:middle
while in the background state.

00:37:40.296 --> 00:37:41.776 A:middle
So this is not providing any

00:37:41.776 --> 00:37:43.596 A:middle
utility to the user and this can

00:37:43.596 --> 00:37:45.206 A:middle
definitely be optimized within

00:37:45.206 --> 00:37:46.016 A:middle
the application.

00:37:47.326 --> 00:37:49.106 A:middle
We are accessing core location

00:37:49.386 --> 00:37:51.296 A:middle
and that call is not getting

00:37:51.446 --> 00:37:52.756 A:middle
ended and that's why core

00:37:52.756 --> 00:37:54.326 A:middle
location is continuously being

00:37:54.326 --> 00:37:56.196 A:middle
utilized resulting in the very

00:37:56.196 --> 00:37:58.366 A:middle
high utilization for location as

00:37:58.366 --> 00:37:59.706 A:middle
you can see in the pie chart.

00:38:00.706 --> 00:38:02.846 A:middle
You also see a gray portion on

00:38:02.846 --> 00:38:04.586 A:middle
the backgrounding section which

00:38:04.586 --> 00:38:06.696 A:middle
is the static costs associated

00:38:06.926 --> 00:38:08.516 A:middle
with keeping your device awake.

00:38:08.996 --> 00:38:10.956 A:middle
So as long as your devices

00:38:10.956 --> 00:38:12.096 A:middle
continues to be in the

00:38:12.096 --> 00:38:13.456 A:middle
background state because of this

00:38:13.456 --> 00:38:15.016 A:middle
application, there is going to

00:38:15.016 --> 00:38:16.526 A:middle
be certain cost that is going to

00:38:16.526 --> 00:38:17.766 A:middle
be built to your particular

00:38:17.766 --> 00:38:18.466 A:middle
application.

00:38:20.116 --> 00:38:21.356 A:middle
So these are some of the

00:38:21.356 --> 00:38:23.716 A:middle
scenarios that we want you to

00:38:23.716 --> 00:38:25.436 A:middle
run on your applications when

00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:26.666 A:middle
you're trying to debug it for

00:38:26.666 --> 00:38:32.236 A:middle
energy issues, identify what are

00:38:32.236 --> 00:38:33.326 A:middle
the scenarios which are

00:38:33.326 --> 00:38:34.726 A:middle
meaningful to your particular

00:38:34.726 --> 00:38:37.436 A:middle
application, run those scenarios

00:38:37.606 --> 00:38:39.636 A:middle
using Energy Gauges, and see

00:38:39.636 --> 00:38:40.836 A:middle
what does the report tell you

00:38:40.836 --> 00:38:42.196 A:middle
about the energy impact from

00:38:42.196 --> 00:38:43.576 A:middle
executing each one of them.

00:38:44.326 --> 00:38:45.956 A:middle
Make the necessary improvements

00:38:45.956 --> 00:38:47.506 A:middle
or optimization within your

00:38:47.506 --> 00:38:48.316 A:middle
application.

00:38:48.766 --> 00:38:50.376 A:middle
Use instruments to drill down

00:38:50.376 --> 00:38:50.796 A:middle
deeper.

00:38:51.256 --> 00:38:52.306 A:middle
And solve the problems

00:38:52.306 --> 00:38:53.336 A:middle
pertaining to energy.

00:38:54.216 --> 00:38:55.686 A:middle
Rerun these scenarios in your

00:38:55.686 --> 00:38:57.126 A:middle
application after you have

00:38:57.126 --> 00:38:59.476 A:middle
improved your code and verify

00:38:59.476 --> 00:39:01.066 A:middle
that Energy Gauges tells you

00:38:59.476 --> 00:39:01.066 A:middle
that Energy Gauges tells you

00:39:01.066 --> 00:39:02.646 A:middle
that now you have moved towards

00:39:02.646 --> 00:39:04.236 A:middle
the lower energy impact or the

00:39:04.236 --> 00:39:04.856 A:middle
green zone.

00:39:06.046 --> 00:39:07.936 A:middle
With that, I would like to hand

00:39:07.936 --> 00:39:09.936 A:middle
it over to Daniel for the final

00:39:09.936 --> 00:39:11.256 A:middle
thoughts and wrap-up of this

00:39:11.256 --> 00:39:11.956 A:middle
presentation.

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:17.056 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:39:17.556 --> 00:39:18.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; As you guys saw, you'll

00:39:18.256 --> 00:39:18.906 A:middle
definitely want to check out

00:39:18.906 --> 00:39:19.566 A:middle
Energy Gauges.

00:39:19.566 --> 00:39:21.096 A:middle
It'll help you find great energy

00:39:21.096 --> 00:39:22.126 A:middle
improvements to your apps.

00:39:22.506 --> 00:39:23.776 A:middle
So let's wrap it up with some

00:39:23.776 --> 00:39:24.356 A:middle
final thoughts.

00:39:25.766 --> 00:39:27.006 A:middle
First, you'll want to use NSURL

00:39:27.006 --> 00:39:28.186 A:middle
Session Background Session

00:39:28.246 --> 00:39:29.676 A:middle
whenever applicable.

00:39:29.836 --> 00:39:31.746 A:middle
It'll really help the system

00:39:31.746 --> 00:39:32.786 A:middle
find the best time to do your

00:39:32.786 --> 00:39:32.996 A:middle
work.

00:39:34.146 --> 00:39:35.226 A:middle
Next, make sure you minimize

00:39:35.226 --> 00:39:36.536 A:middle
your use of continuous location.

00:39:37.126 --> 00:39:38.356 A:middle
Remember that this will cause

00:39:38.356 --> 00:39:39.266 A:middle
your device to stay awake.

00:39:40.526 --> 00:39:41.616 A:middle
Next, avoid timers.

00:39:42.266 --> 00:39:43.706 A:middle
If you need timers, set leeway

00:39:43.956 --> 00:39:44.636 A:middle
to ensure that they're

00:39:44.636 --> 00:39:45.166 A:middle
coalesced.

00:39:45.586 --> 00:39:47.446 A:middle
And finally, use Energy Gauges.

00:39:47.716 --> 00:39:48.836 A:middle
It'll definitely help you find

00:39:48.876 --> 00:39:49.726 A:middle
great optimizations.

00:39:50.686 --> 00:39:51.716 A:middle
Here're some related sessions.

00:39:51.806 --> 00:39:52.866 A:middle
You'll definitely want to watch

00:39:52.866 --> 00:39:53.796 A:middle
the videos for these.

00:39:54.136 --> 00:39:54.936 A:middle
Thank you very much.
