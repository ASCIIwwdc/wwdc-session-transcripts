WEBVTT

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:29.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello everybody.

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:34.726 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:36.266 A:middle
&gt;&gt; My name is Mike Stern.

00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:38.056 A:middle
I manage the Design Evangelism

00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:39.836 A:middle
Team at Apple, and it is my

00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:41.506 A:middle
honor to be with you today to

00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:42.416 A:middle
talk about design.

00:00:44.036 --> 00:00:46.226 A:middle
Now, at Apple, we often use the

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:48.966 A:middle
term human interface to describe

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.546 A:middle
what might otherwise be called

00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:51.646 A:middle
user interface.

00:00:52.326 --> 00:00:55.216 A:middle
Human interface is an uncommon,

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.056 A:middle
not widely used term, but it has

00:00:58.056 --> 00:01:01.176 A:middle
a really long history at Apple.

00:01:01.176 --> 00:01:02.916 A:middle
Our design documentation, this

00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:05.246 A:middle
is the newly redesigned macOS

00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:07.816 A:middle
HIG, it is called the Human

00:01:07.816 --> 00:01:09.176 A:middle
Interface Guidelines.

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:12.886 A:middle
This document goes all the way

00:01:12.886 --> 00:01:17.036 A:middle
back to 1978, a full 15 years

00:01:17.036 --> 00:01:18.536 A:middle
before I was even born.

00:01:19.296 --> 00:01:19.756 A:middle
I'm just kidding.

00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:20.646 A:middle
I'm old [laughter].

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:24.606 A:middle
The word user can have a

00:01:24.716 --> 00:01:27.126 A:middle
clinical or anonymizing effect.

00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:29.976 A:middle
It narrowly defines people in

00:01:29.976 --> 00:01:31.576 A:middle
relation to the interface.

00:01:32.356 --> 00:01:34.916 A:middle
Human evokes a much more nuance

00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:36.896 A:middle
picture of who it is that we are

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:37.796 A:middle
designing for.

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:40.126 A:middle
If I say I'm only human, it is

00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:41.786 A:middle
to acknowledge that I have

00:01:41.786 --> 00:01:43.906 A:middle
imperfections, and I have

00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:44.596 A:middle
shortcomings.

00:01:44.596 --> 00:01:45.846 A:middle
I might fall short of your

00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:46.996 A:middle
expectations of me.

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:48.476 A:middle
Hopefully not right now.

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:51.596 A:middle
But the word human is also how

00:01:51.596 --> 00:01:54.176 A:middle
we express our highest and most

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:55.336 A:middle
noble qualities.

00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:57.186 A:middle
When you acknowledge someone's

00:01:57.186 --> 00:01:59.486 A:middle
humanity, you're recognizing

00:01:59.826 --> 00:02:01.396 A:middle
their kindness, their

00:02:01.396 --> 00:02:04.516 A:middle
compassion, their generosity and

00:02:06.096 --> 00:02:06.286 A:middle
goodness.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:08.046 A:middle
Designing an interface is

00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:09.776 A:middle
fundamentally about serving

00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:10.926 A:middle
other human beings.

00:02:11.906 --> 00:02:12.906 A:middle
The goal isn't to make a

00:02:12.906 --> 00:02:14.146 A:middle
beautiful app, or a

00:02:14.146 --> 00:02:16.476 A:middle
well-organized app, or a simple

00:02:16.476 --> 00:02:17.646 A:middle
app or a focused app.

00:02:18.696 --> 00:02:19.916 A:middle
Those things are all really

00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:21.556 A:middle
important, but they're not the

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:22.406 A:middle
real goal.

00:02:23.286 --> 00:02:26.056 A:middle
The real goal is about serving

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.246 A:middle
the human beings or positively

00:02:28.316 --> 00:02:29.926 A:middle
affecting the lives of the

00:02:29.926 --> 00:02:31.876 A:middle
people who use the apps that you

00:02:31.876 --> 00:02:32.206 A:middle
make.

00:02:33.756 --> 00:02:35.296 A:middle
The only thing that really

00:02:35.296 --> 00:02:37.126 A:middle
matters is how well your app

00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:39.586 A:middle
satisfies the emotional and

00:02:39.586 --> 00:02:41.716 A:middle
practical needs of the people

00:02:41.716 --> 00:02:42.786 A:middle
you are designing for.

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:46.666 A:middle
We have the need for safety and

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.616 A:middle
predictability.

00:02:48.456 --> 00:02:49.856 A:middle
We have a need for knowledge,

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:52.276 A:middle
for meaning, and understanding.

00:02:53.326 --> 00:02:55.206 A:middle
We have a need to accomplish

00:02:55.206 --> 00:02:58.106 A:middle
tasks, to achieve our personal

00:02:58.456 --> 00:02:59.956 A:middle
and professional goals.

00:03:00.986 --> 00:03:02.446 A:middle
And we have the need to

00:03:02.446 --> 00:03:05.256 A:middle
experience beauty and joy.

00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:08.946 A:middle
Well-designed apps should

00:03:08.946 --> 00:03:10.176 A:middle
provide these things.

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:13.256 A:middle
Well-designed apps make it easy

00:03:13.256 --> 00:03:15.046 A:middle
for people to predict the

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:16.866 A:middle
consequences that their actions

00:03:16.866 --> 00:03:17.416 A:middle
will have.

00:03:18.236 --> 00:03:20.646 A:middle
They feel stable, solid,

00:03:21.136 --> 00:03:22.046 A:middle
trustworthy.

00:03:23.276 --> 00:03:24.346 A:middle
They help people to make

00:03:24.346 --> 00:03:26.466 A:middle
informed choices by providing

00:03:26.466 --> 00:03:28.326 A:middle
information that is clear and

00:03:28.326 --> 00:03:28.936 A:middle
helpful.

00:03:29.846 --> 00:03:31.076 A:middle
They have streamlined and

00:03:31.076 --> 00:03:33.506 A:middle
simplified workflows, so that

00:03:33.506 --> 00:03:35.236 A:middle
people can effectively and

00:03:35.326 --> 00:03:37.426 A:middle
efficiently accomplish their

00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:38.026 A:middle
tasks.

00:03:38.636 --> 00:03:40.556 A:middle
And they should have an

00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:42.516 A:middle
aesthetically pleasing,

00:03:42.896 --> 00:03:45.586 A:middle
enjoyable, and even delightful

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:46.596 A:middle
experience.

00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:49.516 A:middle
Using apps that provides these

00:03:49.516 --> 00:03:51.976 A:middle
qualities is so gratifying, so

00:03:52.046 --> 00:03:53.796 A:middle
satisfying, you can tell that

00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:55.196 A:middle
the people who made the app

00:03:55.946 --> 00:03:58.456 A:middle
fully considered your needs.

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:01.076 A:middle
You sense all the time and all

00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:02.006 A:middle
the effort that went into

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:04.056 A:middle
figuring out how to help you get

00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:05.736 A:middle
things done quickly and

00:04:05.736 --> 00:04:06.506 A:middle
successfully.

00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:08.436 A:middle
Everything is there for a

00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:08.886 A:middle
purpose.

00:04:09.576 --> 00:04:11.186 A:middle
Everything is understandable.

00:04:12.416 --> 00:04:15.116 A:middle
It just feels so human.

00:04:15.646 --> 00:04:18.626 A:middle
When an app makes us feel this

00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:21.836 A:middle
way, we sense the humanity of

00:04:21.836 --> 00:04:23.396 A:middle
the people who designed it.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.506 A:middle
So how does the design of your

00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:28.396 A:middle
app accomplish this?

00:04:28.856 --> 00:04:30.276 A:middle
Now, when we talk about design,

00:04:31.066 --> 00:04:34.296 A:middle
we often focus on technique and

00:04:34.296 --> 00:04:34.946 A:middle
process.

00:04:35.516 --> 00:04:36.906 A:middle
And while these are important

00:04:36.906 --> 00:04:38.776 A:middle
considerations, they don't lead

00:04:38.776 --> 00:04:39.806 A:middle
to great designs.

00:04:40.376 --> 00:04:41.886 A:middle
At least not on their own.

00:04:42.696 --> 00:04:44.586 A:middle
Great designs are guided by a

00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:47.006 A:middle
deeper understanding about what

00:04:47.006 --> 00:04:49.256 A:middle
design is, at a more

00:04:49.716 --> 00:04:52.626 A:middle
fundamental, more human level.

00:04:54.136 --> 00:04:56.206 A:middle
This is what design principles

00:04:56.206 --> 00:04:57.096 A:middle
offer us.

00:04:57.736 --> 00:05:00.646 A:middle
They express core truths about

00:05:00.646 --> 00:05:02.446 A:middle
how we perceive the world around

00:05:02.446 --> 00:05:02.776 A:middle
us.

00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:05.636 A:middle
How we process information, how

00:05:05.636 --> 00:05:07.656 A:middle
we make decisions, and how we

00:05:07.656 --> 00:05:08.326 A:middle
communicate.

00:05:09.336 --> 00:05:12.396 A:middle
These truths are universal and

00:05:12.396 --> 00:05:13.046 A:middle
timeless.

00:05:14.096 --> 00:05:16.026 A:middle
They apply to all kinds of

00:05:16.026 --> 00:05:17.276 A:middle
graphic design.

00:05:17.486 --> 00:05:19.166 A:middle
Graphic design architecture,

00:05:19.496 --> 00:05:21.386 A:middle
interior design, retail design,

00:05:21.386 --> 00:05:22.506 A:middle
landscape design, landscape

00:05:22.506 --> 00:05:24.196 A:middle
design, automotive design, I

00:05:24.416 --> 00:05:25.486 A:middle
think I said landscape twice,

00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:27.706 A:middle
and every other type of design.

00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:30.696 A:middle
Design principles don't tell us

00:05:31.056 --> 00:05:33.356 A:middle
how to do specific things in our

00:05:33.356 --> 00:05:35.966 A:middle
design, they tell us why we

00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:37.066 A:middle
should do those things.

00:05:38.266 --> 00:05:40.076 A:middle
They serve as the foundation

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:42.956 A:middle
upon which great designs are

00:05:42.956 --> 00:05:43.236 A:middle
built.

00:05:44.266 --> 00:05:46.526 A:middle
This session is about sharing

00:05:46.776 --> 00:05:48.576 A:middle
those principles with you.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:52.276 A:middle
Now, some of the things I'll

00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:54.226 A:middle
share today might seem kind of

00:05:54.726 --> 00:05:56.216 A:middle
basic or obvious.

00:05:57.316 --> 00:05:59.796 A:middle
But the most profound things are

00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:00.896 A:middle
often the simplest.

00:06:01.706 --> 00:06:03.456 A:middle
I've been designing for over 20

00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:03.936 A:middle
years.

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:05.666 A:middle
I've been fortunate enough to

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:06.766 A:middle
have worked with many brilliant

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:08.726 A:middle
designers, both at Apple and in

00:06:08.726 --> 00:06:09.776 A:middle
the developer community.

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:12.066 A:middle
I've had in-depth discussions

00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:13.166 A:middle
about a wide range of

00:06:13.166 --> 00:06:14.826 A:middle
interaction design challenges

00:06:15.496 --> 00:06:17.676 A:middle
across a full spectrum of apps

00:06:17.676 --> 00:06:19.316 A:middle
and games with people from

00:06:19.316 --> 00:06:20.176 A:middle
across the globe.

00:06:21.076 --> 00:06:22.846 A:middle
And in all of those experiences,

00:06:22.846 --> 00:06:24.666 A:middle
I'm constantly reminded, I

00:06:24.666 --> 00:06:26.926 A:middle
constantly return to just how

00:06:26.926 --> 00:06:29.356 A:middle
clarifying it is to evaluate a

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:31.406 A:middle
design against the core

00:06:31.406 --> 00:06:33.396 A:middle
principles that we are about to

00:06:33.396 --> 00:06:33.826 A:middle
explore.

00:06:35.626 --> 00:06:38.946 A:middle
Okay. So, because design

00:06:38.946 --> 00:06:41.066 A:middle
principles are universal, I

00:06:41.066 --> 00:06:42.246 A:middle
thought it would be fun for us

00:06:42.246 --> 00:06:43.966 A:middle
to explore how these design

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:46.436 A:middle
principles shape our experiences

00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:48.406 A:middle
in the real world.

00:06:49.176 --> 00:06:50.856 A:middle
Now, there really is no better

00:06:50.856 --> 00:06:52.516 A:middle
way to explore the real world

00:06:52.516 --> 00:06:53.276 A:middle
than to travel.

00:06:53.906 --> 00:06:55.436 A:middle
So, with that in mind, I thought

00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:57.216 A:middle
we would all go on a little trip

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:57.566 A:middle
together.

00:06:58.606 --> 00:07:00.046 A:middle
Now, it took quite a bit of

00:07:00.046 --> 00:07:02.596 A:middle
persuading, but we managed to

00:07:02.596 --> 00:07:04.126 A:middle
allocate a portion of the

00:07:04.126 --> 00:07:06.286 A:middle
evangelism team's travel budget

00:07:06.646 --> 00:07:08.366 A:middle
to buy each one of you here

00:07:08.366 --> 00:07:11.186 A:middle
today a ticket to Hawaii.

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:13.826 A:middle
What? Right?

00:07:14.436 --> 00:07:15.356 A:middle
That's pretty awesome.

00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:18.766 A:middle
Sandy beaches, rainforests,

00:07:18.766 --> 00:07:19.776 A:middle
tropical drinks.

00:07:20.376 --> 00:07:21.556 A:middle
Sounds pretty great, right?

00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:23.286 A:middle
Okay who is down?

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:23.976 A:middle
Who wants to go on this trip?

00:07:24.206 --> 00:07:25.206 A:middle
[Applause and cheering] Yeah?

00:07:25.476 --> 00:07:27.546 A:middle
All right.

00:07:28.096 --> 00:07:30.236 A:middle
Let's go. Now, our journey to

00:07:30.236 --> 00:07:31.856 A:middle
lovely Hawaii is going to begin

00:07:31.856 --> 00:07:33.726 A:middle
somewhere slightly less lovely,

00:07:34.346 --> 00:07:35.056 A:middle
at the airport.

00:07:36.146 --> 00:07:37.626 A:middle
As we approach the airport, we

00:07:37.626 --> 00:07:39.236 A:middle
are going to see all sorts of

00:07:39.236 --> 00:07:39.906 A:middle
signs.

00:07:41.006 --> 00:07:42.656 A:middle
At first, we see signs about how

00:07:42.656 --> 00:07:44.096 A:middle
to get to our terminal.

00:07:44.886 --> 00:07:47.216 A:middle
Then we see signs that provide

00:07:47.216 --> 00:07:48.706 A:middle
more specific information about

00:07:48.706 --> 00:07:49.916 A:middle
what's at each terminal, and

00:07:50.206 --> 00:07:51.886 A:middle
after we find our terminal and

00:07:51.926 --> 00:07:54.096 A:middle
park, we head into the terminal,

00:07:54.096 --> 00:07:55.946 A:middle
and then we get directions to

00:07:55.946 --> 00:07:56.446 A:middle
our gate.

00:07:57.086 --> 00:07:58.426 A:middle
And once we get to our gate, we

00:07:58.426 --> 00:07:59.226 A:middle
are going to know we're in the

00:07:59.226 --> 00:08:00.826 A:middle
right place, because there is a

00:08:00.826 --> 00:08:02.736 A:middle
big old sign telling us so.

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:04.436 A:middle
And if we are in the wrong

00:08:04.436 --> 00:08:05.876 A:middle
place, or if our flight was

00:08:05.876 --> 00:08:08.486 A:middle
moved, we get directions to

00:08:08.486 --> 00:08:09.396 A:middle
nearby gates.

00:08:10.546 --> 00:08:11.796 A:middle
And in case there is an

00:08:11.796 --> 00:08:14.026 A:middle
emergency or we just want to

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:16.416 A:middle
leave, nearby exits are clearly

00:08:16.416 --> 00:08:16.716 A:middle
marked.

00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:19.646 A:middle
The system of signs that we

00:08:19.646 --> 00:08:21.446 A:middle
followed is what is called a

00:08:21.446 --> 00:08:22.606 A:middle
wayfinding system.

00:08:23.386 --> 00:08:25.746 A:middle
Wayfinding systems help people

00:08:25.746 --> 00:08:27.936 A:middle
to navigate complex environments

00:08:28.256 --> 00:08:29.616 A:middle
quickly and successfully.

00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:31.486 A:middle
They are critical for helping

00:08:31.486 --> 00:08:33.816 A:middle
people feel oriented and safe.

00:08:34.666 --> 00:08:36.736 A:middle
People at airports are tired,

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:38.786 A:middle
they're jet-lagged, they're in a

00:08:38.786 --> 00:08:40.396 A:middle
rush, they're stressed out.

00:08:41.066 --> 00:08:42.536 A:middle
So airports need to think really

00:08:42.536 --> 00:08:44.236 A:middle
deeply about wayfinding.

00:08:44.936 --> 00:08:48.066 A:middle
Good wayfinding systems offer a

00:08:48.066 --> 00:08:50.096 A:middle
comprehensive and understandable

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:53.156 A:middle
list of general locations that

00:08:53.156 --> 00:08:54.186 A:middle
people can visit.

00:08:55.136 --> 00:08:57.116 A:middle
They provide needed detail about

00:08:57.116 --> 00:08:58.496 A:middle
what's in those locations.

00:08:59.626 --> 00:09:01.126 A:middle
They are highly contextual.

00:09:01.676 --> 00:09:02.836 A:middle
They become increasingly

00:09:02.836 --> 00:09:04.936 A:middle
specific as we navigate deeper

00:09:04.936 --> 00:09:06.256 A:middle
and deeper into the system.

00:09:07.106 --> 00:09:08.436 A:middle
They help people to orient

00:09:08.436 --> 00:09:09.796 A:middle
themselves by clearly

00:09:09.796 --> 00:09:10.816 A:middle
highlighting their current

00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:12.646 A:middle
location relative to other

00:09:12.646 --> 00:09:13.466 A:middle
locations.

00:09:14.096 --> 00:09:16.486 A:middle
And they provide a clear exit

00:09:16.486 --> 00:09:16.626 A:middle
path.

00:09:17.816 --> 00:09:20.006 A:middle
It's so comforting to know that

00:09:20.006 --> 00:09:21.906 A:middle
you can return to a place that

00:09:21.906 --> 00:09:23.996 A:middle
is more familiar and start over.

00:09:25.096 --> 00:09:28.016 A:middle
Wayfinding helps us to feel safe

00:09:28.346 --> 00:09:30.226 A:middle
by answering really basic

00:09:30.226 --> 00:09:33.136 A:middle
questions like: where am I?

00:09:34.246 --> 00:09:35.126 A:middle
Where can I go?

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.576 A:middle
What will I find when I get

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:37.856 A:middle
there?

00:09:38.926 --> 00:09:39.616 A:middle
What's nearby?

00:09:40.576 --> 00:09:41.866 A:middle
And how do I get out?

00:09:43.066 --> 00:09:44.626 A:middle
Without answers to questions

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.396 A:middle
like these, we'd be lost.

00:09:47.266 --> 00:09:49.366 A:middle
Now, your app's interface is

00:09:49.366 --> 00:09:51.066 A:middle
really just one big old

00:09:51.066 --> 00:09:52.186 A:middle
wayfinding system.

00:09:52.716 --> 00:09:54.176 A:middle
The navigation bar, the content

00:09:54.176 --> 00:09:55.446 A:middle
area, the tab bar, they're all

00:09:55.446 --> 00:09:56.636 A:middle
just tools for providing

00:09:56.636 --> 00:09:58.186 A:middle
wayfinding in your app.

00:09:58.806 --> 00:10:00.366 A:middle
The navigation bar title and

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:02.106 A:middle
selected tab bar item lets

00:10:02.106 --> 00:10:02.966 A:middle
people know where they are.

00:10:04.286 --> 00:10:06.056 A:middle
Tab bar in content areas lets

00:10:06.056 --> 00:10:07.276 A:middle
people know where they can go

00:10:07.276 --> 00:10:08.056 A:middle
and what's nearby.

00:10:09.036 --> 00:10:11.056 A:middle
Simply rendered and recognizable

00:10:11.056 --> 00:10:12.326 A:middle
tab bar glyphs and

00:10:12.326 --> 00:10:14.966 A:middle
understandable labels suggest to

00:10:14.966 --> 00:10:16.716 A:middle
people what they will find when

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:17.286 A:middle
they get there.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.776 A:middle
And back buttons offer an exit

00:10:20.846 --> 00:10:21.906 A:middle
route, and can help people to

00:10:21.906 --> 00:10:23.646 A:middle
identify what area of the app

00:10:23.716 --> 00:10:24.206 A:middle
that they're in.

00:10:25.566 --> 00:10:27.966 A:middle
Now every screen in your app

00:10:28.326 --> 00:10:29.786 A:middle
should answer all of these

00:10:29.786 --> 00:10:31.486 A:middle
questions, or else people will

00:10:31.486 --> 00:10:32.286 A:middle
feel lost.

00:10:32.826 --> 00:10:35.176 A:middle
So go through your app.

00:10:35.936 --> 00:10:37.836 A:middle
Go one screen at a time, and ask

00:10:37.836 --> 00:10:39.306 A:middle
yourself, how well is each

00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:40.506 A:middle
screen answering these

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:41.026 A:middle
questions?

00:10:42.106 --> 00:10:43.806 A:middle
Does every screen help people to

00:10:43.806 --> 00:10:44.646 A:middle
know where they are?

00:10:45.256 --> 00:10:46.856 A:middle
Does every screen help provide

00:10:46.856 --> 00:10:48.846 A:middle
options to people to tell them

00:10:48.846 --> 00:10:49.766 A:middle
where else they can go?

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:52.406 A:middle
If some screens aren't answering

00:10:52.406 --> 00:10:54.656 A:middle
those questions clearly, then

00:10:54.656 --> 00:10:55.966 A:middle
there is some work to be done.

00:10:55.966 --> 00:10:57.646 A:middle
All right.

00:10:58.066 --> 00:11:00.366 A:middle
So we have a flight to catch.

00:11:00.776 --> 00:11:01.826 A:middle
Paradise awaits.

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:04.696 A:middle
Wow. That was a quick flight.

00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:07.056 A:middle
If only they were all so quick.

00:11:08.486 --> 00:11:10.506 A:middle
So we have arrived in paradise,

00:11:10.746 --> 00:11:12.556 A:middle
and it's time to pick up our car

00:11:12.556 --> 00:11:13.676 A:middle
and head to the hotel.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:16.256 A:middle
What a sweet car it is.

00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:18.386 A:middle
It has got a sweet candy red

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.146 A:middle
paint job.

00:11:19.456 --> 00:11:20.386 A:middle
Check out those rims.

00:11:20.996 --> 00:11:22.606 A:middle
Looks like it will do zero to 60

00:11:22.606 --> 00:11:25.796 A:middle
in like 10 or maybe 11 seconds.

00:11:26.556 --> 00:11:27.746 A:middle
It is a pretty small car.

00:11:27.746 --> 00:11:29.226 A:middle
If I were you, I would yell out

00:11:29.226 --> 00:11:30.416 A:middle
shotgun right now.

00:11:31.856 --> 00:11:32.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Shotgun!

00:11:32.596 --> 00:11:33.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [Laughs] All right, all

00:11:33.936 --> 00:11:36.086 A:middle
joking aside, cars are actually

00:11:36.086 --> 00:11:36.956 A:middle
quite dangerous.

00:11:37.426 --> 00:11:38.716 A:middle
The fact that we let people

00:11:38.716 --> 00:11:40.076 A:middle
drive around two-ton metal

00:11:40.076 --> 00:11:41.736 A:middle
objects at high velocities is

00:11:41.736 --> 00:11:42.796 A:middle
kind of ludicrous.

00:11:43.246 --> 00:11:44.866 A:middle
Especially when those people

00:11:44.866 --> 00:11:46.876 A:middle
could be tired and navigating

00:11:46.876 --> 00:11:48.056 A:middle
unfamiliar roads.

00:11:48.906 --> 00:11:50.386 A:middle
Now, because of the inherent

00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:52.986 A:middle
danger of driving a vehicle, car

00:11:52.986 --> 00:11:54.326 A:middle
manufacturers have to think

00:11:54.616 --> 00:11:56.336 A:middle
carefully about the design of

00:11:56.336 --> 00:11:57.006 A:middle
interiors.

00:11:57.006 --> 00:11:58.916 A:middle
Safety is a primary

00:11:58.916 --> 00:11:59.796 A:middle
consideration.

00:12:00.376 --> 00:12:01.996 A:middle
And so they're a great way for

00:12:01.996 --> 00:12:03.396 A:middle
us to learn about the design

00:12:03.396 --> 00:12:04.966 A:middle
principle of feedback.

00:12:06.296 --> 00:12:08.146 A:middle
Feedback helps us to operate

00:12:08.146 --> 00:12:10.356 A:middle
cars confidently and safely.

00:12:10.886 --> 00:12:12.886 A:middle
Feedback helps us to anticipate

00:12:12.886 --> 00:12:14.776 A:middle
problems that might cause the

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:16.756 A:middle
car to stop functioning properly

00:12:16.756 --> 00:12:18.536 A:middle
or to stop moving all together.

00:12:19.386 --> 00:12:21.466 A:middle
Our vacation definitely won't be

00:12:21.466 --> 00:12:23.186 A:middle
very fun if that happens.

00:12:24.086 --> 00:12:25.706 A:middle
Now, cars provide various forms

00:12:25.706 --> 00:12:26.126 A:middle
of feedback.

00:12:26.656 --> 00:12:28.036 A:middle
There is status feedback to let

00:12:28.036 --> 00:12:29.536 A:middle
us know how the car is doing.

00:12:29.986 --> 00:12:31.346 A:middle
There is completion feedback to

00:12:31.346 --> 00:12:33.526 A:middle
let us know whether actions

00:12:33.526 --> 00:12:34.716 A:middle
we've performed are completed

00:12:35.056 --> 00:12:36.456 A:middle
successfully or failed.

00:12:37.116 --> 00:12:38.586 A:middle
Warning feedback, to tell us

00:12:38.586 --> 00:12:39.906 A:middle
about potential problems.

00:12:40.506 --> 00:12:41.776 A:middle
And there is feedback to let us

00:12:41.776 --> 00:12:43.136 A:middle
know when something we've tried

00:12:43.136 --> 00:12:45.036 A:middle
to do has caused an error.

00:12:45.596 --> 00:12:48.506 A:middle
Now, for our safety, for the

00:12:48.506 --> 00:12:49.836 A:middle
safety of other drivers and

00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:51.876 A:middle
pedestrians, the feedback that

00:12:51.876 --> 00:12:53.566 A:middle
cars provide must be clear,

00:12:53.996 --> 00:12:55.986 A:middle
immediate, and understandable.

00:12:56.896 --> 00:12:58.696 A:middle
So let's check out how cars

00:12:58.696 --> 00:13:01.006 A:middle
communicate with us, starting

00:13:01.006 --> 00:13:02.196 A:middle
with how they tell us about

00:13:02.196 --> 00:13:02.976 A:middle
their status.

00:13:03.836 --> 00:13:05.136 A:middle
Now, we have all loaded into the

00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:07.036 A:middle
car, and we are ready to go.

00:13:07.736 --> 00:13:09.806 A:middle
So looking at the gear shifter,

00:13:10.096 --> 00:13:11.676 A:middle
I can see that the car is in

00:13:11.676 --> 00:13:12.076 A:middle
park.

00:13:12.816 --> 00:13:14.676 A:middle
Knowing what gear the car is in

00:13:14.926 --> 00:13:16.846 A:middle
is super important information.

00:13:17.386 --> 00:13:18.786 A:middle
It is so important that it's

00:13:18.836 --> 00:13:20.726 A:middle
displayed twice, on the

00:13:20.726 --> 00:13:22.756 A:middle
gearshift, and in the instrument

00:13:22.756 --> 00:13:23.206 A:middle
cluster.

00:13:23.986 --> 00:13:25.476 A:middle
It would be really bad if I

00:13:25.476 --> 00:13:27.156 A:middle
thought the car was in park when

00:13:27.156 --> 00:13:29.596 A:middle
it was actually in drive, or if

00:13:29.596 --> 00:13:30.906 A:middle
I thought the car was in drive,

00:13:30.946 --> 00:13:32.756 A:middle
when it was actually in reverse.

00:13:33.816 --> 00:13:35.326 A:middle
Other status feedback lets me

00:13:35.396 --> 00:13:36.856 A:middle
see the fuel level, so I can

00:13:36.856 --> 00:13:38.986 A:middle
anticipate and predict how far

00:13:38.986 --> 00:13:40.516 A:middle
we can go before we need to

00:13:40.516 --> 00:13:41.076 A:middle
refuel.

00:13:42.256 --> 00:13:43.686 A:middle
And seeing our current speed

00:13:43.686 --> 00:13:45.876 A:middle
helps me to avoid getting costly

00:13:45.876 --> 00:13:46.786 A:middle
speeding tickets.

00:13:47.626 --> 00:13:49.076 A:middle
These are two really critical

00:13:49.076 --> 00:13:50.226 A:middle
pieces of information.

00:13:50.526 --> 00:13:51.596 A:middle
I don't want to run out of gas

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:53.296 A:middle
before we get to the hotel, and

00:13:53.296 --> 00:13:54.586 A:middle
the lovely folks in finance have

00:13:54.586 --> 00:13:56.606 A:middle
told me repeatedly that I cannot

00:13:56.956 --> 00:13:58.186 A:middle
expend speeding tickets.

00:13:59.006 --> 00:14:00.836 A:middle
Now, status information in apps

00:14:00.836 --> 00:14:02.276 A:middle
should be just as clear.

00:14:02.866 --> 00:14:04.426 A:middle
So, for example, in the mail

00:14:04.666 --> 00:14:06.386 A:middle
app, unread status indicators

00:14:06.766 --> 00:14:09.216 A:middle
help people to prioritize which

00:14:09.216 --> 00:14:10.856 A:middle
emails to read first.

00:14:11.626 --> 00:14:13.426 A:middle
In Calendar, status indicators

00:14:13.426 --> 00:14:15.216 A:middle
help people to see when someone

00:14:15.216 --> 00:14:16.076 A:middle
can't make a meeting and it

00:14:16.076 --> 00:14:17.176 A:middle
helps them determine if they

00:14:17.176 --> 00:14:18.126 A:middle
need to reschedule.

00:14:19.106 --> 00:14:20.256 A:middle
In the Camera app, there are

00:14:20.416 --> 00:14:22.096 A:middle
three elements to let people

00:14:22.096 --> 00:14:23.366 A:middle
know that a video is being

00:14:23.366 --> 00:14:23.926 A:middle
recorded.

00:14:24.376 --> 00:14:26.036 A:middle
The red dot, the incrementing

00:14:26.036 --> 00:14:27.506 A:middle
time code, the state of the

00:14:27.506 --> 00:14:28.356 A:middle
record button.

00:14:28.876 --> 00:14:30.916 A:middle
They all let people know that a

00:14:30.916 --> 00:14:33.636 A:middle
precious but fleeing moment is

00:14:33.636 --> 00:14:34.486 A:middle
being recorded.

00:14:35.776 --> 00:14:37.676 A:middle
Showing status clearly and

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:40.196 A:middle
directly is crucial for saving

00:14:40.196 --> 00:14:42.406 A:middle
people time and helping them to

00:14:42.406 --> 00:14:43.786 A:middle
avoid making mistakes.

00:14:44.946 --> 00:14:46.466 A:middle
Next up is completion feedback.

00:14:46.936 --> 00:14:49.006 A:middle
We are ready to go, so I start

00:14:49.006 --> 00:14:49.406 A:middle
the car [engine starts].

00:14:50.686 --> 00:14:53.836 A:middle
We can hear the engine turn

00:14:53.836 --> 00:14:54.136 A:middle
over.

00:14:54.506 --> 00:14:56.576 A:middle
We can feel the vibration of the

00:14:56.576 --> 00:14:57.256 A:middle
motor running.

00:14:57.906 --> 00:15:00.036 A:middle
We see that instrument cluster

00:15:00.156 --> 00:15:00.986 A:middle
come to life.

00:15:01.916 --> 00:15:03.316 A:middle
There is no doubt that we are

00:15:03.316 --> 00:15:04.066 A:middle
ready to go.

00:15:04.956 --> 00:15:07.556 A:middle
And as I shift, from Park into

00:15:07.556 --> 00:15:11.126 A:middle
Drive, I get tactile feedback to

00:15:11.126 --> 00:15:12.436 A:middle
let me know that I'm moving

00:15:12.436 --> 00:15:13.446 A:middle
through those gears.

00:15:14.476 --> 00:15:15.466 A:middle
And as we pull out of the

00:15:15.466 --> 00:15:17.326 A:middle
parking spot, we hear [clicking]

00:15:18.036 --> 00:15:19.246 A:middle
the doors lock.

00:15:20.146 --> 00:15:21.846 A:middle
This happens automatically, so

00:15:21.846 --> 00:15:23.586 A:middle
it is even more important that

00:15:23.586 --> 00:15:24.626 A:middle
we get this feedback.

00:15:25.446 --> 00:15:26.916 A:middle
All of this feedback is

00:15:26.916 --> 00:15:27.696 A:middle
reassuring.

00:15:28.276 --> 00:15:30.116 A:middle
It's our car's way of saying it

00:15:30.116 --> 00:15:32.206 A:middle
is all good, I'm doing exactly

00:15:32.206 --> 00:15:33.786 A:middle
what it is that you wanted me to

00:15:33.786 --> 00:15:35.816 A:middle
do, and this frees me up to

00:15:35.906 --> 00:15:37.946 A:middle
focus on other cognitive tasks,

00:15:37.946 --> 00:15:39.956 A:middle
like making sure it's safe to

00:15:39.956 --> 00:15:41.286 A:middle
pull out of the parking spot.

00:15:42.316 --> 00:15:43.966 A:middle
Completion feedback in apps

00:15:44.206 --> 00:15:45.776 A:middle
serves the very same purpose.

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:48.136 A:middle
The sound of a locked iPhone

00:15:48.136 --> 00:15:48.696 A:middle
[clicking].

00:15:48.696 --> 00:15:51.846 A:middle
The animation of an email being

00:15:51.846 --> 00:15:54.606 A:middle
marked as unread, or the

00:15:54.606 --> 00:15:56.336 A:middle
animation of an email being

00:15:56.336 --> 00:15:56.756 A:middle
deleted.

00:15:57.786 --> 00:15:59.326 A:middle
These cues are discreet, and

00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:00.536 A:middle
they're non-invasive, but

00:16:00.796 --> 00:16:02.136 A:middle
they're hard to ignore, and they

00:16:02.136 --> 00:16:03.226 A:middle
provide that necessary

00:16:03.226 --> 00:16:05.206 A:middle
reassurance that our devices are

00:16:05.206 --> 00:16:06.756 A:middle
performing as expected.

00:16:07.636 --> 00:16:09.716 A:middle
Of course, confirmation feedback

00:16:09.716 --> 00:16:11.366 A:middle
can be even more obvious.

00:16:11.946 --> 00:16:13.096 A:middle
The animation and sound of a

00:16:13.096 --> 00:16:14.966 A:middle
successful Apple Pay transaction

00:16:14.966 --> 00:16:15.316 A:middle
[tone sounds].

00:16:15.316 --> 00:16:17.486 A:middle
It's very hard to miss.

00:16:18.096 --> 00:16:20.926 A:middle
Every action taken in your app

00:16:21.186 --> 00:16:22.636 A:middle
should provide some form of

00:16:22.636 --> 00:16:24.376 A:middle
confirmation feedback, because

00:16:24.376 --> 00:16:25.896 A:middle
it is absolutely necessary for

00:16:25.896 --> 00:16:27.316 A:middle
letting people know that actions

00:16:27.316 --> 00:16:28.686 A:middle
they've performed were

00:16:28.686 --> 00:16:29.326 A:middle
successful.

00:16:30.546 --> 00:16:32.036 A:middle
Warnings help people to

00:16:32.036 --> 00:16:33.416 A:middle
understand in advance about

00:16:33.416 --> 00:16:34.366 A:middle
potential errors.

00:16:35.016 --> 00:16:36.096 A:middle
Low fuel level.

00:16:36.586 --> 00:16:37.706 A:middle
Low break pads.

00:16:38.066 --> 00:16:39.106 A:middle
Low oil level.

00:16:40.276 --> 00:16:41.706 A:middle
Warnings can be communicated

00:16:41.706 --> 00:16:43.126 A:middle
using status indicators,

00:16:43.126 --> 00:16:44.816 A:middle
messages, and the instrument

00:16:44.816 --> 00:16:46.206 A:middle
cluster, built-in display,

00:16:46.526 --> 00:16:48.426 A:middle
sounds, or all of the above.

00:16:49.306 --> 00:16:50.956 A:middle
These warnings are important.

00:16:51.256 --> 00:16:52.766 A:middle
They keep us safe, and they

00:16:53.036 --> 00:16:55.106 A:middle
protect our car from damage.

00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:58.246 A:middle
And lastly, error feedback in

00:16:58.246 --> 00:17:00.996 A:middle
cars, as with apps, is crucial.

00:17:01.936 --> 00:17:03.136 A:middle
If you try to start a car

00:17:03.136 --> 00:17:05.086 A:middle
without gas, you will get an

00:17:05.086 --> 00:17:06.326 A:middle
error message about that.

00:17:07.156 --> 00:17:08.866 A:middle
Now errors are always

00:17:09.166 --> 00:17:10.846 A:middle
disappointing and frustrating.

00:17:11.316 --> 00:17:12.966 A:middle
It's best to help people avoid

00:17:12.966 --> 00:17:14.136 A:middle
making errors in the first

00:17:14.136 --> 00:17:14.556 A:middle
place.

00:17:15.256 --> 00:17:17.066 A:middle
Warnings and confirmation

00:17:17.066 --> 00:17:17.926 A:middle
feedback can help.

00:17:18.726 --> 00:17:20.316 A:middle
For instance, in-line form

00:17:20.316 --> 00:17:21.686 A:middle
validation is a fantastic

00:17:21.716 --> 00:17:23.196 A:middle
technique for letting people

00:17:23.196 --> 00:17:24.446 A:middle
know what values will be

00:17:24.446 --> 00:17:27.116 A:middle
accepted, and what values will

00:17:27.116 --> 00:17:27.346 A:middle
not.

00:17:28.736 --> 00:17:29.846 A:middle
Getting this feedback in real

00:17:29.846 --> 00:17:31.706 A:middle
time helps people to course

00:17:31.706 --> 00:17:32.986 A:middle
correct so that they don't run

00:17:32.986 --> 00:17:34.106 A:middle
into errors later.

00:17:34.866 --> 00:17:37.006 A:middle
You can also try to infer what a

00:17:37.006 --> 00:17:38.946 A:middle
person was wishing to do, or

00:17:38.946 --> 00:17:40.936 A:middle
what they intended to do when

00:17:40.936 --> 00:17:42.756 A:middle
they made a mistake, and then do

00:17:42.756 --> 00:17:44.066 A:middle
something reasonable.

00:17:44.946 --> 00:17:47.176 A:middle
So, for example, in the new

00:17:47.176 --> 00:17:49.666 A:middle
version of Things 3, if you type

00:17:49.666 --> 00:17:52.586 A:middle
in the date June 31st, which by

00:17:52.586 --> 00:17:53.656 A:middle
the way is a date that does not

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:55.346 A:middle
exist, but it's a common mistake

00:17:55.406 --> 00:17:57.226 A:middle
for people to make, the app

00:17:57.346 --> 00:17:59.536 A:middle
doesn't throw up an error or

00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:00.576 A:middle
show a warning.

00:18:01.296 --> 00:18:03.236 A:middle
No. Instead, it automatically

00:18:03.236 --> 00:18:05.316 A:middle
corrects the date to July 1st.

00:18:06.146 --> 00:18:08.226 A:middle
It's such a subtle thing.

00:18:08.846 --> 00:18:10.516 A:middle
It's kind of brilliant, and it's

00:18:10.516 --> 00:18:12.566 A:middle
a very human thing to do.

00:18:13.946 --> 00:18:15.556 A:middle
Now, as you can see, clear,

00:18:15.656 --> 00:18:17.266 A:middle
timely, and understandable and

00:18:17.266 --> 00:18:18.836 A:middle
informative feedback is

00:18:18.836 --> 00:18:19.376 A:middle
essential.

00:18:19.916 --> 00:18:21.776 A:middle
Feedback answers super important

00:18:21.776 --> 00:18:22.426 A:middle
questions.

00:18:22.956 --> 00:18:24.086 A:middle
What can I do?

00:18:25.206 --> 00:18:26.286 A:middle
What just happened?

00:18:27.216 --> 00:18:28.876 A:middle
What is currently happening?

00:18:29.506 --> 00:18:31.176 A:middle
And what will happen in the

00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:31.646 A:middle
future?

00:18:32.176 --> 00:18:35.376 A:middle
Many apps do not do a very good

00:18:35.376 --> 00:18:36.706 A:middle
job of providing feedback.

00:18:38.196 --> 00:18:40.306 A:middle
The reason for this, I think, is

00:18:40.306 --> 00:18:41.536 A:middle
that when you're designing, it

00:18:41.536 --> 00:18:42.816 A:middle
is so easy to start to think

00:18:42.816 --> 00:18:44.636 A:middle
about static screens, and you

00:18:44.636 --> 00:18:46.076 A:middle
can lose sight of the fact that

00:18:46.076 --> 00:18:47.816 A:middle
interactive experiences happen

00:18:47.816 --> 00:18:50.506 A:middle
over time, with lots of back and

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:50.926 A:middle
forth.

00:18:52.126 --> 00:18:53.866 A:middle
Good feedback is like having a

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:55.406 A:middle
conversation with the person who

00:18:55.406 --> 00:18:55.966 A:middle
designed it.

00:18:56.816 --> 00:18:58.866 A:middle
As a designer, feedback is your

00:18:58.866 --> 00:19:01.126 A:middle
way of letting -- answering

00:19:01.126 --> 00:19:03.056 A:middle
people's unspoken questions.

00:19:03.836 --> 00:19:05.016 A:middle
It is your way of letting people

00:19:05.016 --> 00:19:06.656 A:middle
know how they're doing, and

00:19:06.656 --> 00:19:07.896 A:middle
providing helpful guidance to

00:19:07.896 --> 00:19:08.106 A:middle
them.

00:19:08.866 --> 00:19:10.706 A:middle
So when designing your app,

00:19:11.326 --> 00:19:12.546 A:middle
imagine that you're having a

00:19:12.546 --> 00:19:14.876 A:middle
conversation with the person who

00:19:14.876 --> 00:19:15.346 A:middle
is using it.

00:19:16.276 --> 00:19:17.916 A:middle
What would you say if you were

00:19:17.916 --> 00:19:19.266 A:middle
in the room with them?

00:19:20.216 --> 00:19:21.126 A:middle
How would you say it?

00:19:22.406 --> 00:19:23.996 A:middle
I have a very simple, but highly

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:25.146 A:middle
effective technique to share

00:19:25.146 --> 00:19:25.496 A:middle
with you.

00:19:25.986 --> 00:19:27.456 A:middle
Ask someone who has never used

00:19:27.456 --> 00:19:28.596 A:middle
your app before to use it.

00:19:28.986 --> 00:19:30.736 A:middle
Have them tell you what they are

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:31.996 A:middle
thinking, what they think is

00:19:31.996 --> 00:19:33.696 A:middle
unclear, what they find to be

00:19:33.696 --> 00:19:34.356 A:middle
confusing.

00:19:35.296 --> 00:19:37.896 A:middle
Then simply explain to them how

00:19:37.896 --> 00:19:39.586 A:middle
your app actually works.

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:41.756 A:middle
Guide them along, explain to

00:19:41.756 --> 00:19:43.546 A:middle
them what's happening, and what

00:19:43.546 --> 00:19:44.826 A:middle
they should be paying attention

00:19:44.866 --> 00:19:45.086 A:middle
to.

00:19:46.166 --> 00:19:47.186 A:middle
Then step back.

00:19:48.236 --> 00:19:50.156 A:middle
Consider how what you've said

00:19:50.156 --> 00:19:51.766 A:middle
might differ from what the app

00:19:51.766 --> 00:19:52.756 A:middle
is communicating.

00:19:53.366 --> 00:19:54.886 A:middle
In my experience, when someone

00:19:54.886 --> 00:19:56.576 A:middle
needs to explain their design to

00:19:56.576 --> 00:19:58.886 A:middle
me, it is usually so much more

00:19:58.886 --> 00:20:02.976 A:middle
clear than the design itself.

00:20:03.046 --> 00:20:04.226 A:middle
What people tell me fills in the

00:20:04.226 --> 00:20:06.006 A:middle
gaps that are left by their

00:20:06.006 --> 00:20:06.526 A:middle
design.

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:09.096 A:middle
We tend to be much better

00:20:09.096 --> 00:20:10.856 A:middle
communicators when we're sitting

00:20:10.856 --> 00:20:12.906 A:middle
with someone in person to try to

00:20:12.946 --> 00:20:14.536 A:middle
capture that experience.

00:20:15.556 --> 00:20:16.826 A:middle
Okay, so that is feedback.

00:20:17.446 --> 00:20:18.916 A:middle
Now, the next design principle

00:20:18.916 --> 00:20:20.676 A:middle
is closely related to feedback,

00:20:21.126 --> 00:20:22.516 A:middle
and that is the principle of

00:20:22.516 --> 00:20:23.296 A:middle
visibility.

00:20:24.246 --> 00:20:26.156 A:middle
Good feedback does not matter

00:20:26.156 --> 00:20:27.836 A:middle
very much if people can't see

00:20:27.836 --> 00:20:27.986 A:middle
it.

00:20:28.816 --> 00:20:30.666 A:middle
Visibility captures something

00:20:30.666 --> 00:20:31.756 A:middle
very obvious.

00:20:32.266 --> 00:20:34.126 A:middle
The usability of a design is

00:20:34.156 --> 00:20:36.516 A:middle
greatly improved when controls

00:20:36.516 --> 00:20:38.446 A:middle
and information are clearly

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:38.966 A:middle
visible.

00:20:39.786 --> 00:20:41.596 A:middle
See? It's kind of obvious.

00:20:42.386 --> 00:20:43.766 A:middle
Consider how important

00:20:43.766 --> 00:20:45.776 A:middle
visibility is in your car.

00:20:46.626 --> 00:20:48.036 A:middle
The instrument cluster presents

00:20:48.036 --> 00:20:49.486 A:middle
status information and warning

00:20:49.486 --> 00:20:51.366 A:middle
indicators directly in front of

00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:51.596 A:middle
you.

00:20:52.046 --> 00:20:53.766 A:middle
Instrument clusters are visually

00:20:53.766 --> 00:20:54.196 A:middle
cluttered.

00:20:54.196 --> 00:20:55.196 A:middle
There's all sorts of text, and

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:56.716 A:middle
numbers and moving gauges and

00:20:56.716 --> 00:20:57.786 A:middle
blinking lights and status

00:20:57.786 --> 00:20:58.436 A:middle
indicators.

00:20:59.516 --> 00:21:00.966 A:middle
They're not called clusters

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:01.756 A:middle
without reason.

00:21:02.756 --> 00:21:05.256 A:middle
But all of this is necessary for

00:21:05.256 --> 00:21:07.416 A:middle
operating a vehicle, and needs

00:21:07.416 --> 00:21:10.316 A:middle
to be plainly visible, without

00:21:10.316 --> 00:21:11.906 A:middle
you having to move your head or

00:21:11.906 --> 00:21:12.346 A:middle
your body.

00:21:13.586 --> 00:21:15.106 A:middle
Hiding some of this information

00:21:15.176 --> 00:21:17.076 A:middle
or putting it elsewhere in the

00:21:17.076 --> 00:21:19.276 A:middle
car would hurt usability.

00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:21.526 A:middle
Critical feedback would just get

00:21:21.526 --> 00:21:23.676 A:middle
ignored, and the same is true

00:21:23.676 --> 00:21:24.386 A:middle
for apps.

00:21:25.246 --> 00:21:27.576 A:middle
In the Mail app, badges provide

00:21:27.576 --> 00:21:29.426 A:middle
helpful status information about

00:21:29.426 --> 00:21:30.456 A:middle
email messages.

00:21:31.106 --> 00:21:33.156 A:middle
Removing that information might

00:21:33.216 --> 00:21:34.026 A:middle
reduce clutter.

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:34.746 A:middle
It could look a little bit

00:21:34.746 --> 00:21:37.196 A:middle
cleaner, but it would greatly

00:21:37.246 --> 00:21:38.196 A:middle
reduce usability.

00:21:38.916 --> 00:21:40.136 A:middle
People would have to navigate

00:21:40.826 --> 00:21:42.666 A:middle
into each email message to get

00:21:42.666 --> 00:21:43.486 A:middle
that information.

00:21:44.236 --> 00:21:45.506 A:middle
It would be very inefficient,

00:21:45.766 --> 00:21:47.126 A:middle
and it would be very tedious.

00:21:47.846 --> 00:21:49.326 A:middle
So it is important to surface

00:21:49.416 --> 00:21:51.376 A:middle
key status information at higher

00:21:51.376 --> 00:21:53.216 A:middle
levels whenever possible.

00:21:54.376 --> 00:21:56.176 A:middle
Or, consider the navigation in

00:21:56.176 --> 00:21:56.726 A:middle
the Clock app.

00:21:57.576 --> 00:21:59.566 A:middle
What if that was hidden into a

00:21:59.566 --> 00:22:00.366 A:middle
hamburger menu.

00:22:01.246 --> 00:22:02.726 A:middle
People would have a much harder

00:22:02.796 --> 00:22:04.996 A:middle
time seeing what other functions

00:22:05.036 --> 00:22:06.796 A:middle
the Clock app offers to them

00:22:07.166 --> 00:22:08.486 A:middle
beyond what is currently

00:22:08.486 --> 00:22:08.966 A:middle
visible.

00:22:10.346 --> 00:22:11.716 A:middle
Obviously there is a tradeoff

00:22:11.716 --> 00:22:11.976 A:middle
here.

00:22:12.396 --> 00:22:14.376 A:middle
Densely packed interfaces can be

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:15.926 A:middle
overwhelming and they can slow

00:22:15.926 --> 00:22:18.016 A:middle
decision-making, especially for

00:22:18.016 --> 00:22:19.286 A:middle
people who are new to your app.

00:22:20.236 --> 00:22:22.216 A:middle
So visibility has to be weighed

00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:23.636 A:middle
against other considerations.

00:22:25.036 --> 00:22:27.166 A:middle
Now, with so many of us in the

00:22:27.166 --> 00:22:28.996 A:middle
car, I'm starting to feel a

00:22:28.996 --> 00:22:31.086 A:middle
little bit cramped, and I cannot

00:22:31.086 --> 00:22:32.686 A:middle
wait to get to the hotel, but

00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:34.736 A:middle
there is one more insanely

00:22:34.736 --> 00:22:36.736 A:middle
important design principle to

00:22:36.736 --> 00:22:38.746 A:middle
point out while we're here, and

00:22:38.746 --> 00:22:40.496 A:middle
that is about consistency.

00:22:41.056 --> 00:22:43.826 A:middle
The principle of consistency is

00:22:43.826 --> 00:22:45.586 A:middle
about representing similar

00:22:45.586 --> 00:22:48.746 A:middle
design features in similar ways.

00:22:49.436 --> 00:22:51.516 A:middle
If you've driven a car before,

00:22:51.906 --> 00:22:53.426 A:middle
there are symbols and terms that

00:22:53.426 --> 00:22:54.626 A:middle
you are no doubt familiar with.

00:22:55.136 --> 00:22:56.476 A:middle
You will recognize the symbols

00:22:56.476 --> 00:22:58.396 A:middle
for door lock, for window, for

00:22:58.686 --> 00:23:01.296 A:middle
gas, headlights, battery, oil,

00:23:01.826 --> 00:23:02.386 A:middle
and so forth.

00:23:03.106 --> 00:23:04.596 A:middle
You will be familiar with the

00:23:04.596 --> 00:23:06.906 A:middle
definitions of words like Park,

00:23:06.976 --> 00:23:08.776 A:middle
Drive, and Reverse, as they

00:23:08.776 --> 00:23:10.356 A:middle
apply to the operation of a

00:23:10.356 --> 00:23:10.866 A:middle
vehicle.

00:23:12.066 --> 00:23:13.976 A:middle
Consistency also applies to the

00:23:13.976 --> 00:23:15.886 A:middle
location and the configuration

00:23:15.886 --> 00:23:16.716 A:middle
of controls.

00:23:17.316 --> 00:23:19.086 A:middle
We all expect the brake to be on

00:23:19.086 --> 00:23:21.306 A:middle
the left, and the accelerator to

00:23:21.306 --> 00:23:22.206 A:middle
be on the right.

00:23:23.656 --> 00:23:25.396 A:middle
Consistency greatly improves the

00:23:25.396 --> 00:23:27.716 A:middle
usability of a vehicle, or maybe

00:23:27.716 --> 00:23:29.856 A:middle
it is more clear to just flip

00:23:29.856 --> 00:23:30.846 A:middle
this around and say that

00:23:30.846 --> 00:23:32.956 A:middle
inconsistency undermines

00:23:33.356 --> 00:23:34.016 A:middle
usability.

00:23:34.626 --> 00:23:38.236 A:middle
Whoops. All cars share a common

00:23:38.236 --> 00:23:40.266 A:middle
design vocabulary for these

00:23:40.336 --> 00:23:41.426 A:middle
symbols and terms.

00:23:42.146 --> 00:23:43.996 A:middle
All cars position controls in a

00:23:44.036 --> 00:23:45.436 A:middle
relatively consistent way, and

00:23:45.896 --> 00:23:47.546 A:middle
because of this consistency, we

00:23:47.546 --> 00:23:48.846 A:middle
don't have to re-learn how to

00:23:48.846 --> 00:23:50.686 A:middle
drive a car every time we get

00:23:50.686 --> 00:23:52.116 A:middle
behind the wheel of a new one.

00:23:52.846 --> 00:23:54.786 A:middle
Now, maybe this is obvious, but

00:23:54.786 --> 00:23:57.086 A:middle
consistency is actually hard to

00:23:57.086 --> 00:23:57.486 A:middle
achieve.

00:23:58.216 --> 00:23:59.866 A:middle
You have to make a conscious

00:23:59.976 --> 00:24:02.956 A:middle
effort to be consistent, and you

00:24:02.956 --> 00:24:04.856 A:middle
have to be consistent with the

00:24:04.856 --> 00:24:05.546 A:middle
right things.

00:24:05.546 --> 00:24:08.316 A:middle
You have to fully consider what

00:24:08.316 --> 00:24:09.786 A:middle
expectations people have when

00:24:09.786 --> 00:24:10.636 A:middle
they come to your app.

00:24:11.196 --> 00:24:13.046 A:middle
Those expectations are mostly

00:24:13.046 --> 00:24:15.176 A:middle
informed by their experiences

00:24:15.176 --> 00:24:16.556 A:middle
with the other apps that they

00:24:16.556 --> 00:24:17.176 A:middle
use.

00:24:17.986 --> 00:24:19.536 A:middle
The other apps that they use,

00:24:19.536 --> 00:24:20.706 A:middle
how do you figure that out?

00:24:20.706 --> 00:24:22.176 A:middle
Of course, it is impossible for

00:24:22.176 --> 00:24:22.756 A:middle
you to know.

00:24:23.316 --> 00:24:25.696 A:middle
But you can make some informed

00:24:25.696 --> 00:24:26.276 A:middle
guesses.

00:24:26.896 --> 00:24:28.426 A:middle
Perhaps they've used other apps

00:24:28.466 --> 00:24:29.676 A:middle
that are similar to the things

00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:30.686 A:middle
that your app does.

00:24:31.326 --> 00:24:31.836 A:middle
Maybe not.

00:24:32.656 --> 00:24:34.796 A:middle
But it's very likely that they

00:24:34.796 --> 00:24:36.096 A:middle
have used other apps on the

00:24:36.096 --> 00:24:36.766 A:middle
platform.

00:24:37.106 --> 00:24:38.706 A:middle
So you should pay attention to

00:24:38.736 --> 00:24:40.156 A:middle
platform conventions.

00:24:40.776 --> 00:24:42.846 A:middle
Things like iconography and

00:24:43.046 --> 00:24:45.106 A:middle
terminology, navigation schemes,

00:24:45.616 --> 00:24:47.686 A:middle
and even common work flows for

00:24:47.686 --> 00:24:48.646 A:middle
typical tasks.

00:24:49.836 --> 00:24:51.926 A:middle
Now, let me give you just one

00:24:51.926 --> 00:24:53.596 A:middle
example to make this, I think, a

00:24:53.596 --> 00:24:54.876 A:middle
lot more concrete.

00:24:55.716 --> 00:24:57.996 A:middle
On iOS, the glyph that we use to

00:24:57.996 --> 00:24:59.676 A:middle
represent the concept of an

00:24:59.846 --> 00:25:01.796 A:middle
action is an arrow that points

00:25:01.796 --> 00:25:03.296 A:middle
up and away from a box.

00:25:04.206 --> 00:25:05.916 A:middle
Because the most common action

00:25:05.916 --> 00:25:08.016 A:middle
associated with this glyph is

00:25:08.016 --> 00:25:10.006 A:middle
share, we affectionately call

00:25:10.006 --> 00:25:11.456 A:middle
this a "sharrow."

00:25:11.586 --> 00:25:13.966 A:middle
I love that name.

00:25:14.726 --> 00:25:16.626 A:middle
Now, some apps use a different

00:25:16.626 --> 00:25:18.566 A:middle
icon to represent a similar

00:25:18.566 --> 00:25:19.146 A:middle
concept.

00:25:19.886 --> 00:25:21.846 A:middle
This icon is commonplace.

00:25:21.846 --> 00:25:23.736 A:middle
It is used on websites and other

00:25:23.736 --> 00:25:24.426 A:middle
platforms.

00:25:24.976 --> 00:25:26.476 A:middle
Now, this is a great glyph.

00:25:26.956 --> 00:25:28.016 A:middle
Do not get me wrong.

00:25:28.296 --> 00:25:29.486 A:middle
There is nothing wrong with this

00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:30.376 A:middle
glyph at all.

00:25:30.746 --> 00:25:32.916 A:middle
But it's not the symbol that iOS

00:25:32.916 --> 00:25:34.556 A:middle
users are most familiar with.

00:25:35.346 --> 00:25:37.536 A:middle
This glyph shows up in iOS apps

00:25:37.856 --> 00:25:39.596 A:middle
because of the desire to be

00:25:39.626 --> 00:25:41.836 A:middle
consistent, to consistently

00:25:41.836 --> 00:25:43.436 A:middle
represent this concept in a

00:25:43.436 --> 00:25:46.536 A:middle
consistent way across platforms

00:25:46.536 --> 00:25:47.706 A:middle
or with your website.

00:25:48.676 --> 00:25:51.086 A:middle
This is a perfectly rational and

00:25:51.086 --> 00:25:53.276 A:middle
reasonable thing to do, but it

00:25:53.276 --> 00:25:54.566 A:middle
is not the right call.

00:25:55.266 --> 00:25:56.566 A:middle
From the perspective of the

00:25:56.566 --> 00:25:57.826 A:middle
person who you are designing

00:25:57.876 --> 00:25:59.956 A:middle
for, it is best to be consistent

00:26:00.206 --> 00:26:01.186 A:middle
with the symbol that they are

00:26:01.186 --> 00:26:02.236 A:middle
most familiar with.

00:26:03.516 --> 00:26:05.406 A:middle
Being consistent will go a long

00:26:05.406 --> 00:26:07.476 A:middle
way towards making your app more

00:26:07.476 --> 00:26:09.206 A:middle
approachable and usable.

00:26:09.206 --> 00:26:13.066 A:middle
Now, look, there is always the

00:26:13.066 --> 00:26:15.666 A:middle
impulse to, you know, do things

00:26:15.666 --> 00:26:16.546 A:middle
a little bit different.

00:26:17.286 --> 00:26:19.486 A:middle
And to be clear, this is a

00:26:19.486 --> 00:26:20.606 A:middle
really good thing.

00:26:20.606 --> 00:26:24.116 A:middle
You should absolutely be trying

00:26:24.116 --> 00:26:25.566 A:middle
out new ideas.

00:26:25.656 --> 00:26:27.216 A:middle
That's how innovation happens.

00:26:28.126 --> 00:26:30.136 A:middle
But inconsistencies about simple

00:26:30.136 --> 00:26:32.276 A:middle
things, like icons and labels,

00:26:32.276 --> 00:26:33.696 A:middle
can really trip people up.

00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:36.126 A:middle
So it's always best to be

00:26:36.126 --> 00:26:37.556 A:middle
consistent unless you have a

00:26:37.556 --> 00:26:40.046 A:middle
very strong justification to do

00:26:40.046 --> 00:26:40.676 A:middle
otherwise.

00:26:41.896 --> 00:26:43.026 A:middle
Now, I'm sure you're all

00:26:43.026 --> 00:26:44.176 A:middle
consistently ready to get out of

00:26:44.176 --> 00:26:45.406 A:middle
this car and get to the hotel,

00:26:45.596 --> 00:26:46.736 A:middle
but there is one last point

00:26:46.736 --> 00:26:47.936 A:middle
about consistency that I'd like

00:26:48.006 --> 00:26:49.416 A:middle
to make, and it is about

00:26:49.416 --> 00:26:50.486 A:middle
internal consistency.

00:26:51.566 --> 00:26:53.436 A:middle
Internal consistency is about

00:26:53.436 --> 00:26:55.386 A:middle
designing controls to share a

00:26:55.386 --> 00:26:57.356 A:middle
similar look and feel, that

00:26:57.356 --> 00:26:58.166 A:middle
match each other.

00:26:58.816 --> 00:27:00.886 A:middle
Your app's glyphs should have a

00:27:00.886 --> 00:27:02.566 A:middle
consistent visual style.

00:27:03.246 --> 00:27:04.776 A:middle
Text in your app should have a

00:27:04.776 --> 00:27:06.606 A:middle
limited number of font faces and

00:27:06.606 --> 00:27:09.156 A:middle
sizes and colors and so forth.

00:27:10.206 --> 00:27:12.476 A:middle
Internal consistency helps to

00:27:12.476 --> 00:27:15.286 A:middle
make an app feel cohesive or

00:27:15.286 --> 00:27:15.746 A:middle
whole.

00:27:16.666 --> 00:27:18.416 A:middle
When everything matches, when

00:27:18.416 --> 00:27:20.296 A:middle
everything fits, people are

00:27:20.296 --> 00:27:21.726 A:middle
given a deeper sense of a

00:27:21.726 --> 00:27:23.096 A:middle
product's integrity.

00:27:23.806 --> 00:27:25.886 A:middle
We intuitively believe that

00:27:25.926 --> 00:27:28.056 A:middle
design choices were deliberate

00:27:28.496 --> 00:27:29.856 A:middle
and thoroughly considered.

00:27:31.076 --> 00:27:32.336 A:middle
And with very good reason.

00:27:32.716 --> 00:27:34.166 A:middle
Being consistent takes

00:27:34.476 --> 00:27:36.306 A:middle
self-control and restraint.

00:27:37.446 --> 00:27:39.046 A:middle
All right, now because our car

00:27:39.046 --> 00:27:40.606 A:middle
was so darn consistent, we

00:27:40.606 --> 00:27:42.396 A:middle
finally managed to arrive safely

00:27:42.396 --> 00:27:43.206 A:middle
at the hotel.

00:27:44.266 --> 00:27:46.076 A:middle
That car ride was really stuffy.

00:27:46.266 --> 00:27:47.546 A:middle
So you decide to head up to your

00:27:47.546 --> 00:27:49.366 A:middle
room and freshen up a little

00:27:49.646 --> 00:27:49.736 A:middle
bit.

00:27:50.056 --> 00:27:51.456 A:middle
Perhaps you go throw on that

00:27:51.516 --> 00:27:53.426 A:middle
fresh new Aloha shirt you picked

00:27:53.426 --> 00:27:54.196 A:middle
up at the airport.

00:27:55.026 --> 00:27:56.296 A:middle
So, when you get to your room,

00:27:56.796 --> 00:27:58.776 A:middle
you head to the bathroom, and

00:27:58.776 --> 00:28:00.266 A:middle
you turn the handles on the

00:28:00.266 --> 00:28:02.256 A:middle
faucet and let the water run a

00:28:02.256 --> 00:28:03.726 A:middle
little bit.

00:28:03.726 --> 00:28:05.126 A:middle
And after a couple of seconds

00:28:05.496 --> 00:28:06.546 A:middle
you put your finger under the

00:28:06.546 --> 00:28:07.786 A:middle
water to check the temperature.

00:28:08.476 --> 00:28:10.346 A:middle
It's still a little bit cool, so

00:28:10.346 --> 00:28:11.516 A:middle
you increase the hot water a

00:28:11.516 --> 00:28:12.036 A:middle
little bit.

00:28:12.556 --> 00:28:13.676 A:middle
You wait another couple of

00:28:13.676 --> 00:28:15.146 A:middle
seconds, and the water warms up,

00:28:15.486 --> 00:28:17.136 A:middle
and you commence face washing.

00:28:18.086 --> 00:28:20.536 A:middle
You feel refreshed and

00:28:20.536 --> 00:28:21.396 A:middle
reinvigorated.

00:28:23.046 --> 00:28:24.926 A:middle
Compared to driving a car, a

00:28:25.016 --> 00:28:26.906 A:middle
faucet is really basic.

00:28:27.716 --> 00:28:29.366 A:middle
But at some point, you had to

00:28:29.366 --> 00:28:30.846 A:middle
learn how to use a faucet.

00:28:31.606 --> 00:28:32.886 A:middle
You learned by adjusting the

00:28:32.886 --> 00:28:34.376 A:middle
controls of various faucets and

00:28:34.376 --> 00:28:35.886 A:middle
observing the results.

00:28:36.866 --> 00:28:38.226 A:middle
For example, how do you know

00:28:38.226 --> 00:28:39.496 A:middle
which handle controlled the hot

00:28:39.496 --> 00:28:39.876 A:middle
water?

00:28:40.576 --> 00:28:42.776 A:middle
You knew because for the most

00:28:42.776 --> 00:28:44.576 A:middle
part hot water is controlled by

00:28:44.576 --> 00:28:45.776 A:middle
the handle on the left.

00:28:47.196 --> 00:28:48.526 A:middle
And why would you keep testing

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:49.726 A:middle
water temperature for a few

00:28:49.726 --> 00:28:50.186 A:middle
seconds?

00:28:50.686 --> 00:28:52.076 A:middle
You did this, because you expect

00:28:52.076 --> 00:28:53.286 A:middle
there to be a delay between when

00:28:53.286 --> 00:28:54.836 A:middle
you adjust the temperature and

00:28:54.836 --> 00:28:56.136 A:middle
when the water actually gets

00:28:56.136 --> 00:28:56.576 A:middle
warmer.

00:28:56.576 --> 00:28:59.576 A:middle
Looking at the water, it is

00:28:59.576 --> 00:29:01.046 A:middle
really hard to tell if the water

00:29:01.046 --> 00:29:03.546 A:middle
is cold or hot, and we have all

00:29:03.546 --> 00:29:05.036 A:middle
experienced burning our hand

00:29:05.036 --> 00:29:05.916 A:middle
under a faucet.

00:29:06.836 --> 00:29:08.286 A:middle
Now, you don't think about these

00:29:08.346 --> 00:29:09.966 A:middle
things every time you use a

00:29:10.036 --> 00:29:10.516 A:middle
faucet.

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:12.826 A:middle
You just intuitively expect

00:29:12.826 --> 00:29:12.996 A:middle
them.

00:29:14.146 --> 00:29:16.186 A:middle
Within each of your brains,

00:29:16.636 --> 00:29:18.346 A:middle
there is this tiny, little

00:29:18.816 --> 00:29:22.376 A:middle
adorable model of a faucet, and

00:29:22.376 --> 00:29:24.576 A:middle
that model represents the faucet

00:29:24.956 --> 00:29:27.046 A:middle
as a system of parts and

00:29:27.106 --> 00:29:28.916 A:middle
functions and behaviors.

00:29:30.616 --> 00:29:32.366 A:middle
There is a spout for producing

00:29:32.366 --> 00:29:34.016 A:middle
water, there's handles for

00:29:34.016 --> 00:29:35.146 A:middle
controlling temperature and

00:29:35.146 --> 00:29:35.486 A:middle
flow.

00:29:36.426 --> 00:29:37.986 A:middle
Those parts are arranged in

00:29:37.986 --> 00:29:41.446 A:middle
specific configuration, and your

00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:43.116 A:middle
model has certain behaviors,

00:29:43.116 --> 00:29:44.806 A:middle
like the latency between when

00:29:44.806 --> 00:29:46.326 A:middle
you adjust the hot water, and

00:29:46.326 --> 00:29:47.116 A:middle
when the temperature of the

00:29:47.116 --> 00:29:48.856 A:middle
water actually increases.

00:29:49.866 --> 00:29:52.206 A:middle
This model is referred to as

00:29:52.206 --> 00:29:53.736 A:middle
your mental model.

00:29:54.716 --> 00:29:56.516 A:middle
You have a mental model of every

00:29:56.576 --> 00:29:57.666 A:middle
system that you've ever

00:29:57.666 --> 00:29:58.396 A:middle
interacted with.

00:29:59.146 --> 00:30:00.676 A:middle
Those mental models are

00:30:00.676 --> 00:30:02.026 A:middle
over-simplifications.

00:30:02.446 --> 00:30:03.846 A:middle
They don't fully capture the

00:30:03.846 --> 00:30:05.426 A:middle
inner workings of these systems.

00:30:05.426 --> 00:30:07.116 A:middle
Though, the more experience you

00:30:07.116 --> 00:30:08.956 A:middle
have with a system, the more

00:30:08.956 --> 00:30:12.586 A:middle
sophisticated your model

00:30:12.586 --> 00:30:12.976 A:middle
becomes.

00:30:13.046 --> 00:30:13.886 A:middle
Mental models are developed

00:30:13.886 --> 00:30:15.276 A:middle
through personal experience, and

00:30:15.276 --> 00:30:16.686 A:middle
they're based on an incomplete

00:30:16.786 --> 00:30:18.876 A:middle
set of facts, so everyone's

00:30:18.876 --> 00:30:20.426 A:middle
mental model is unique.

00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:22.546 A:middle
Now, real quick, there is

00:30:22.546 --> 00:30:24.366 A:middle
actually two parts of a mental

00:30:24.366 --> 00:30:25.496 A:middle
model that are worth

00:30:25.496 --> 00:30:26.716 A:middle
understanding separately.

00:30:27.216 --> 00:30:29.146 A:middle
A system model is the model

00:30:29.806 --> 00:30:31.616 A:middle
about how a system works.

00:30:32.436 --> 00:30:33.816 A:middle
Our system model might involve

00:30:33.886 --> 00:30:35.296 A:middle
thinking about two independent

00:30:35.296 --> 00:30:37.146 A:middle
sources of water, one hot, and

00:30:37.146 --> 00:30:37.806 A:middle
one cold.

00:30:38.806 --> 00:30:40.196 A:middle
And the system allows those

00:30:40.196 --> 00:30:41.956 A:middle
inputs to be mixed, to create a

00:30:42.036 --> 00:30:43.096 A:middle
range of temperatures.

00:30:43.946 --> 00:30:45.226 A:middle
The system is not immediately

00:30:45.226 --> 00:30:45.996 A:middle
responsive.

00:30:46.196 --> 00:30:47.176 A:middle
Changes to temperature could

00:30:47.176 --> 00:30:48.226 A:middle
take a little bit of time,

00:30:49.126 --> 00:30:50.696 A:middle
especially when we first turn on

00:30:50.696 --> 00:30:51.526 A:middle
the faucet, right?

00:30:51.816 --> 00:30:53.326 A:middle
Our system model includes this

00:30:53.326 --> 00:30:55.466 A:middle
understanding of variable

00:30:55.516 --> 00:30:56.726 A:middle
latency and temperature.

00:30:57.986 --> 00:31:00.086 A:middle
Okay. The other term is

00:31:00.086 --> 00:31:01.166 A:middle
interaction model.

00:31:01.536 --> 00:31:03.456 A:middle
Now, does anyone care to guess

00:31:03.816 --> 00:31:05.026 A:middle
what that model is?

00:31:05.416 --> 00:31:06.796 A:middle
Just go ahead and shout it out.

00:31:07.756 --> 00:31:08.456 A:middle
No, I'm just kidding.

00:31:08.556 --> 00:31:10.406 A:middle
Okay, you guys didn't fall for

00:31:10.406 --> 00:31:10.496 A:middle
that.

00:31:10.496 --> 00:31:11.176 A:middle
You're a smart crowd.

00:31:11.666 --> 00:31:13.626 A:middle
If you guessed that it's a model

00:31:13.626 --> 00:31:15.086 A:middle
about how we interact with the

00:31:15.086 --> 00:31:17.026 A:middle
system, then you are correct.

00:31:18.106 --> 00:31:20.146 A:middle
Our interaction model is that we

00:31:20.146 --> 00:31:21.776 A:middle
adjust the temperature and water

00:31:21.776 --> 00:31:23.406 A:middle
flow with the handles that are

00:31:23.406 --> 00:31:23.936 A:middle
provided.

00:31:25.066 --> 00:31:26.706 A:middle
Okay, so now that we know a

00:31:26.706 --> 00:31:28.416 A:middle
couple of fancy terms, you might

00:31:28.416 --> 00:31:30.036 A:middle
be wondering how all of this is

00:31:30.036 --> 00:31:30.776 A:middle
relevant to you?

00:31:31.516 --> 00:31:34.316 A:middle
Well, when a system such as a

00:31:34.316 --> 00:31:36.526 A:middle
faucet matches our mental model,

00:31:36.756 --> 00:31:38.036 A:middle
then our expectations of that

00:31:38.036 --> 00:31:38.716 A:middle
system are met.

00:31:39.336 --> 00:31:40.786 A:middle
When this happens, and we're not

00:31:40.786 --> 00:31:42.346 A:middle
really conscious of our own

00:31:42.346 --> 00:31:44.676 A:middle
expectations, we perceive the

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:46.306 A:middle
system to be intuitive.

00:31:47.866 --> 00:31:49.766 A:middle
Conversely, when a system

00:31:49.766 --> 00:31:51.276 A:middle
doesn't match our mental model,

00:31:51.536 --> 00:31:53.376 A:middle
it breaks our expectations, and

00:31:53.376 --> 00:31:54.726 A:middle
we perceive it to be

00:31:54.726 --> 00:31:55.696 A:middle
unintuitive.

00:31:57.236 --> 00:31:58.626 A:middle
Now, let's just sit with this

00:31:58.626 --> 00:31:59.726 A:middle
concept for a second.

00:32:00.156 --> 00:32:01.856 A:middle
Because it's a really, really

00:32:01.856 --> 00:32:03.466 A:middle
important one in design.

00:32:03.716 --> 00:32:06.636 A:middle
And to do that, I would like to

00:32:06.636 --> 00:32:08.296 A:middle
share with you a little story

00:32:08.986 --> 00:32:11.416 A:middle
about a faucet designer named

00:32:11.586 --> 00:32:12.056 A:middle
Mortimer.

00:32:13.396 --> 00:32:15.906 A:middle
Now, like all of you, Mortimer

00:32:15.906 --> 00:32:17.806 A:middle
has a mental model of faucets.

00:32:18.326 --> 00:32:20.096 A:middle
Though obviously Morty's mental

00:32:20.096 --> 00:32:22.246 A:middle
model is way more sophisticated,

00:32:22.656 --> 00:32:24.536 A:middle
and way more bad ass than yours.

00:32:25.086 --> 00:32:26.806 A:middle
I'm just being real with you, he

00:32:26.806 --> 00:32:27.876 A:middle
is a faucet designer for a

00:32:27.876 --> 00:32:28.246 A:middle
living.

00:32:29.176 --> 00:32:30.916 A:middle
Now, consider that job that he

00:32:30.916 --> 00:32:31.316 A:middle
has.

00:32:32.036 --> 00:32:33.856 A:middle
His job is all about making

00:32:33.856 --> 00:32:35.766 A:middle
amazing, best in class,

00:32:36.186 --> 00:32:38.536 A:middle
delightful faucet experiences.

00:32:39.956 --> 00:32:41.146 A:middle
And one day, like a bolt of

00:32:41.146 --> 00:32:43.156 A:middle
lightning, he's struck with this

00:32:44.016 --> 00:32:45.086 A:middle
amazing idea.

00:32:45.276 --> 00:32:47.346 A:middle
We have been doing this faucet

00:32:47.396 --> 00:32:48.576 A:middle
thing all wrong.

00:32:49.216 --> 00:32:51.396 A:middle
He has a new concept about how

00:32:51.506 --> 00:32:52.616 A:middle
to make things better.

00:32:53.526 --> 00:32:55.646 A:middle
Instead of using one handle for

00:32:55.646 --> 00:32:57.466 A:middle
hot water flow, and another

00:32:57.466 --> 00:32:59.766 A:middle
handle for cold water flow, we

00:32:59.766 --> 00:33:01.286 A:middle
should just have one lever to

00:33:01.286 --> 00:33:02.936 A:middle
control temperature, and the

00:33:02.936 --> 00:33:04.526 A:middle
other should control flow.

00:33:05.096 --> 00:33:06.066 A:middle
This way people won't

00:33:06.066 --> 00:33:07.156 A:middle
accidentally increase or

00:33:07.156 --> 00:33:08.166 A:middle
decrease temperature when they

00:33:08.166 --> 00:33:09.586 A:middle
are adjusting flow and vice

00:33:09.586 --> 00:33:09.956 A:middle
versa.

00:33:11.456 --> 00:33:13.096 A:middle
It is brilliant.

00:33:14.036 --> 00:33:15.926 A:middle
This is why they pay Mortimer

00:33:16.026 --> 00:33:16.716 A:middle
the big bucks.

00:33:17.506 --> 00:33:19.316 A:middle
Now, at this point, Morty has

00:33:19.416 --> 00:33:21.836 A:middle
this new and super awesome

00:33:21.836 --> 00:33:23.516 A:middle
mental model about faucets in

00:33:23.516 --> 00:33:24.116 A:middle
his mind.

00:33:24.796 --> 00:33:26.466 A:middle
Unfortunately, there is just one

00:33:26.896 --> 00:33:30.066 A:middle
tiny little problem.

00:33:30.166 --> 00:33:31.846 A:middle
Morty's mental model doesn't

00:33:31.846 --> 00:33:33.236 A:middle
match the mental model that

00:33:33.236 --> 00:33:34.936 A:middle
people have about faucets.

00:33:35.686 --> 00:33:37.086 A:middle
When people use the Morty

00:33:37.086 --> 00:33:38.646 A:middle
faucet, it doesn't match their

00:33:38.646 --> 00:33:41.116 A:middle
expectations at all and they say

00:33:41.116 --> 00:33:42.316 A:middle
it is unintuitive.

00:33:43.676 --> 00:33:45.726 A:middle
What is worse, the Morty faucet

00:33:45.976 --> 00:33:47.596 A:middle
looks nearly identical to a

00:33:47.596 --> 00:33:49.526 A:middle
regular faucet, but it behaved

00:33:49.606 --> 00:33:50.606 A:middle
totally different.

00:33:51.636 --> 00:33:52.836 A:middle
When people turned on the hot

00:33:52.836 --> 00:33:54.766 A:middle
water, no water came out.

00:33:56.006 --> 00:33:57.756 A:middle
This mismatch between expected

00:33:57.756 --> 00:34:00.076 A:middle
behavior and experienced reality

00:34:00.076 --> 00:34:02.096 A:middle
created a major usability

00:34:02.096 --> 00:34:02.606 A:middle
problem.

00:34:03.646 --> 00:34:05.146 A:middle
Perhaps alterations to the

00:34:05.146 --> 00:34:06.556 A:middle
faucet's form could suggest that

00:34:06.556 --> 00:34:07.876 A:middle
it had a different interaction

00:34:07.876 --> 00:34:08.236 A:middle
model.

00:34:09.246 --> 00:34:10.766 A:middle
Maybe adding labels would help,

00:34:10.766 --> 00:34:13.616 A:middle
but these are just remedies to a

00:34:13.676 --> 00:34:14.416 A:middle
deeper issue.

00:34:15.136 --> 00:34:16.716 A:middle
Labels and subtle variations of

00:34:16.796 --> 00:34:18.466 A:middle
form are design cues that can

00:34:18.466 --> 00:34:20.226 A:middle
easily be overlooked, especially

00:34:20.226 --> 00:34:21.746 A:middle
when people have deeply

00:34:21.746 --> 00:34:23.806 A:middle
ingrained notions about how a

00:34:23.806 --> 00:34:25.416 A:middle
system works, and how they

00:34:25.416 --> 00:34:26.176 A:middle
interact with it.

00:34:27.576 --> 00:34:29.966 A:middle
This is a big issue in app

00:34:29.966 --> 00:34:30.366 A:middle
design.

00:34:31.156 --> 00:34:33.386 A:middle
Trust me, I have been there more

00:34:33.386 --> 00:34:33.836 A:middle
than once.

00:34:34.746 --> 00:34:36.576 A:middle
Trying to get people to change

00:34:36.576 --> 00:34:38.146 A:middle
their mental model of how your

00:34:38.146 --> 00:34:39.606 A:middle
app works is risky.

00:34:40.376 --> 00:34:42.226 A:middle
This becomes even more true the

00:34:42.226 --> 00:34:43.736 A:middle
more familiar people are with

00:34:43.786 --> 00:34:44.426 A:middle
your app.

00:34:45.366 --> 00:34:46.776 A:middle
Changes to any long-lived

00:34:46.776 --> 00:34:49.146 A:middle
existing product will inevitably

00:34:49.146 --> 00:34:50.806 A:middle
be hard for people to adjust to.

00:34:50.806 --> 00:34:52.376 A:middle
It really doesn't matter how

00:34:52.376 --> 00:34:54.286 A:middle
good or how necessary those

00:34:54.286 --> 00:34:55.036 A:middle
changes may be.

00:34:55.436 --> 00:34:57.896 A:middle
When considering big changes to

00:34:57.896 --> 00:34:59.886 A:middle
an existing app, you have to be

00:34:59.886 --> 00:35:02.456 A:middle
100 percent positive that those

00:35:02.456 --> 00:35:04.196 A:middle
changes will lead to clear wins

00:35:04.256 --> 00:35:05.766 A:middle
for the people who currently use

00:35:05.766 --> 00:35:06.376 A:middle
your app.

00:35:06.876 --> 00:35:08.706 A:middle
Making changes just for the sake

00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:10.096 A:middle
of it is not a good

00:35:10.096 --> 00:35:10.966 A:middle
justification.

00:35:11.666 --> 00:35:12.376 A:middle
Go carefully.

00:35:12.686 --> 00:35:13.606 A:middle
Test your design.

00:35:13.966 --> 00:35:15.226 A:middle
Prove to yourself beyond a

00:35:15.226 --> 00:35:17.286 A:middle
shadow of a doubt that your

00:35:17.286 --> 00:35:19.086 A:middle
innovations are objectively

00:35:19.086 --> 00:35:19.446 A:middle
better.

00:35:20.566 --> 00:35:22.696 A:middle
If you can do that, then it's

00:35:22.696 --> 00:35:23.546 A:middle
good to push through.

00:35:23.936 --> 00:35:24.936 A:middle
People will come around

00:35:25.106 --> 00:35:25.606 A:middle
eventually.

00:35:27.186 --> 00:35:30.116 A:middle
Okay. So it's time to start

00:35:30.116 --> 00:35:31.206 A:middle
getting ready for dinner.

00:35:31.626 --> 00:35:33.016 A:middle
So you decide to throw on that

00:35:33.106 --> 00:35:35.666 A:middle
dope new Aloha shirt, and you

00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:37.146 A:middle
exit the bathroom and you turn

00:35:37.146 --> 00:35:38.726 A:middle
off the lights by flipping a

00:35:38.726 --> 00:35:39.166 A:middle
switch.

00:35:39.856 --> 00:35:41.226 A:middle
The sun is setting outside.

00:35:41.226 --> 00:35:43.586 A:middle
It is a bit dark, so you turn on

00:35:43.586 --> 00:35:44.556 A:middle
a light in the hallway.

00:35:45.366 --> 00:35:46.696 A:middle
Then you walk over to the

00:35:46.696 --> 00:35:48.596 A:middle
bedroom and you flip on another

00:35:48.596 --> 00:35:50.826 A:middle
couple of light switches to turn

00:35:50.826 --> 00:35:52.036 A:middle
the lights on out there.

00:35:52.946 --> 00:35:54.716 A:middle
This, in a nutshell, is the

00:35:54.716 --> 00:35:56.986 A:middle
design principle of proximity.

00:35:58.146 --> 00:36:00.296 A:middle
Proximity is about the distance

00:36:00.326 --> 00:36:02.506 A:middle
between a control and the object

00:36:02.636 --> 00:36:03.546 A:middle
that it affects.

00:36:04.526 --> 00:36:06.506 A:middle
The closer a control is to that

00:36:06.506 --> 00:36:08.946 A:middle
object, the more we assume there

00:36:08.986 --> 00:36:11.156 A:middle
to be a connection between the

00:36:11.156 --> 00:36:11.446 A:middle
two.

00:36:12.636 --> 00:36:14.076 A:middle
Of course the bathroom light

00:36:14.076 --> 00:36:15.066 A:middle
switch is in the bathroom.

00:36:15.416 --> 00:36:16.636 A:middle
Of course the hallway light

00:36:16.636 --> 00:36:17.486 A:middle
switch is in the hallway.

00:36:17.746 --> 00:36:19.126 A:middle
Of course the bedroom light

00:36:19.126 --> 00:36:21.696 A:middle
switch is in the bedroom.

00:36:21.806 --> 00:36:23.506 A:middle
Greater proximity also makes

00:36:23.506 --> 00:36:24.576 A:middle
ergonomic sense.

00:36:24.896 --> 00:36:26.356 A:middle
In general, the closer you are

00:36:26.356 --> 00:36:27.566 A:middle
to an object or region of

00:36:27.566 --> 00:36:29.166 A:middle
interest, the more likely you

00:36:29.166 --> 00:36:31.086 A:middle
are to want to interact with it

00:36:31.386 --> 00:36:32.296 A:middle
and control it.

00:36:32.766 --> 00:36:33.946 A:middle
People think to turn on the

00:36:33.946 --> 00:36:35.136 A:middle
bathroom light when they walk

00:36:35.136 --> 00:36:35.886 A:middle
into the bathroom.

00:36:35.886 --> 00:36:37.056 A:middle
So, by putting the light switch

00:36:37.106 --> 00:36:38.786 A:middle
right by the door, it is within

00:36:38.786 --> 00:36:40.136 A:middle
arm's reach when they need it

00:36:40.136 --> 00:36:40.606 A:middle
most.

00:36:42.076 --> 00:36:44.116 A:middle
Proximity is also useful for

00:36:44.116 --> 00:36:46.076 A:middle
expressing relationships between

00:36:46.076 --> 00:36:46.606 A:middle
controls.

00:36:47.156 --> 00:36:48.436 A:middle
So, for example, if you see a

00:36:48.436 --> 00:36:50.526 A:middle
set of switches on the wall, and

00:36:50.526 --> 00:36:51.846 A:middle
you know that one of them

00:36:51.896 --> 00:36:54.026 A:middle
controls lights, then it's

00:36:54.026 --> 00:36:55.546 A:middle
reasonable for you to assume

00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:57.366 A:middle
that every switch is a light

00:36:57.366 --> 00:36:57.756 A:middle
switch.

00:36:58.766 --> 00:37:00.166 A:middle
If one of them controls the

00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:02.036 A:middle
shade, then it would be better

00:37:02.036 --> 00:37:03.446 A:middle
to separate it out from the

00:37:03.446 --> 00:37:03.826 A:middle
rest.

00:37:04.766 --> 00:37:06.656 A:middle
This configuration makes it

00:37:06.656 --> 00:37:08.336 A:middle
easier for people to remember

00:37:08.336 --> 00:37:10.016 A:middle
which switch controls the shade,

00:37:10.376 --> 00:37:11.956 A:middle
and which ones control the

00:37:11.956 --> 00:37:12.386 A:middle
lights.

00:37:13.846 --> 00:37:15.516 A:middle
Okay, now it's probably worth

00:37:15.796 --> 00:37:17.546 A:middle
pointing out right now that we

00:37:17.546 --> 00:37:19.206 A:middle
have a very special name for

00:37:19.206 --> 00:37:21.066 A:middle
this configuration, this

00:37:21.066 --> 00:37:22.276 A:middle
arrangement here on the right.

00:37:22.916 --> 00:37:24.076 A:middle
Does anyone care to guess what

00:37:24.076 --> 00:37:24.526 A:middle
it is?

00:37:25.186 --> 00:37:26.116 A:middle
Just go ahead and shout it out.

00:37:27.296 --> 00:37:28.226 A:middle
Okay, you're smart, you're not

00:37:28.226 --> 00:37:28.846 A:middle
going to fall for it.

00:37:28.966 --> 00:37:31.026 A:middle
I just tried to get you.

00:37:31.026 --> 00:37:32.336 A:middle
Okay, if you guessed in your

00:37:32.336 --> 00:37:34.036 A:middle
mind that it is a group, then

00:37:34.036 --> 00:37:35.256 A:middle
you win a prize.

00:37:35.256 --> 00:37:36.546 A:middle
It is a trip to Hawaii.

00:37:37.466 --> 00:37:39.476 A:middle
Grouping is a very fundamental

00:37:39.476 --> 00:37:40.796 A:middle
and significant design

00:37:40.796 --> 00:37:41.376 A:middle
principle.

00:37:42.016 --> 00:37:43.076 A:middle
Grouping helps people to

00:37:43.076 --> 00:37:44.676 A:middle
understand the relationships

00:37:44.716 --> 00:37:46.656 A:middle
between elements, and it is key

00:37:46.656 --> 00:37:48.306 A:middle
for giving a design structure.

00:37:49.046 --> 00:37:50.656 A:middle
Now, while we all understand

00:37:50.656 --> 00:37:52.806 A:middle
this, many apps don't

00:37:52.806 --> 00:37:54.196 A:middle
effectively use grouping.

00:37:54.306 --> 00:37:55.846 A:middle
It can be easy to overlook.

00:37:57.246 --> 00:37:58.586 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at a

00:37:58.586 --> 00:38:00.156 A:middle
couple of examples of how

00:38:00.156 --> 00:38:02.026 A:middle
proximity and grouping can be

00:38:02.026 --> 00:38:04.636 A:middle
used to structure a design, and

00:38:04.636 --> 00:38:06.546 A:middle
establish relationships between

00:38:06.546 --> 00:38:08.536 A:middle
controls and the objects or

00:38:08.536 --> 00:38:09.666 A:middle
views that they affect.

00:38:10.816 --> 00:38:13.266 A:middle
And keynote, proximity helps us

00:38:13.266 --> 00:38:16.076 A:middle
to associate the view menu with

00:38:16.426 --> 00:38:18.006 A:middle
the slide navigator and the

00:38:18.006 --> 00:38:18.706 A:middle
canvas area.

00:38:18.926 --> 00:38:20.576 A:middle
The objects that it affects.

00:38:21.776 --> 00:38:23.086 A:middle
The object creation tools are

00:38:23.086 --> 00:38:23.856 A:middle
positioned right above the

00:38:23.856 --> 00:38:25.476 A:middle
canvas, which is where those

00:38:25.476 --> 00:38:26.646 A:middle
objects go.

00:38:27.196 --> 00:38:29.486 A:middle
The anime format and document

00:38:29.486 --> 00:38:31.456 A:middle
visibility switches are located

00:38:31.456 --> 00:38:32.736 A:middle
just above where those panels

00:38:32.736 --> 00:38:33.436 A:middle
get displayed.

00:38:34.626 --> 00:38:36.516 A:middle
In Sketch, you can see how

00:38:36.606 --> 00:38:38.306 A:middle
grouping is used to cluster

00:38:38.306 --> 00:38:39.606 A:middle
related controls with each

00:38:39.606 --> 00:38:41.416 A:middle
other, like the grouping

00:38:41.416 --> 00:38:42.016 A:middle
controls.

00:38:42.636 --> 00:38:44.076 A:middle
The Transform and Edit tools.

00:38:44.706 --> 00:38:46.356 A:middle
The Pathfinding operations.

00:38:46.996 --> 00:38:48.646 A:middle
And the Layer Ordering actions.

00:38:50.276 --> 00:38:52.196 A:middle
Now, I just shared two Mac apps,

00:38:52.576 --> 00:38:54.206 A:middle
and the need for proximity and

00:38:54.206 --> 00:38:55.886 A:middle
grouping is definitely higher

00:38:56.156 --> 00:38:57.686 A:middle
the larger your interface is,

00:38:58.186 --> 00:39:00.086 A:middle
but the principles are still

00:39:00.086 --> 00:39:01.896 A:middle
crucial for smaller screens,

00:39:02.186 --> 00:39:04.646 A:middle
like iPads and iPhones, and even

00:39:04.646 --> 00:39:05.376 A:middle
the Apple Watch.

00:39:06.476 --> 00:39:08.546 A:middle
Okay, so I think there is time

00:39:08.826 --> 00:39:10.426 A:middle
to learn about just one more

00:39:10.426 --> 00:39:11.756 A:middle
design principle before we head

00:39:11.756 --> 00:39:12.986 A:middle
downstairs to the hotel

00:39:12.986 --> 00:39:14.656 A:middle
restaurant and grab some dinner.

00:39:15.736 --> 00:39:17.016 A:middle
Let's go back to that Shade

00:39:17.016 --> 00:39:17.996 A:middle
control again.

00:39:18.926 --> 00:39:20.716 A:middle
Now, looking at this control, do

00:39:20.756 --> 00:39:22.406 A:middle
you suppose that the Shade is

00:39:22.456 --> 00:39:24.306 A:middle
open or closed?

00:39:25.316 --> 00:39:25.976 A:middle
How about now?

00:39:26.776 --> 00:39:28.236 A:middle
Just show of hands here.

00:39:28.486 --> 00:39:29.716 A:middle
How many people think that it is

00:39:29.716 --> 00:39:30.286 A:middle
closed?

00:39:31.496 --> 00:39:34.236 A:middle
Okay, okay, and how many of you

00:39:34.306 --> 00:39:35.356 A:middle
think that it is open?

00:39:35.356 --> 00:39:38.516 A:middle
Yeah, you guys are a really

00:39:38.596 --> 00:39:39.776 A:middle
smart group of people.

00:39:39.776 --> 00:39:40.816 A:middle
All right.

00:39:40.816 --> 00:39:43.826 A:middle
Mapping is how you know that it

00:39:43.826 --> 00:39:44.336 A:middle
is closed.

00:39:45.066 --> 00:39:46.376 A:middle
Mapping is about designing

00:39:46.376 --> 00:39:48.556 A:middle
controls to resemble the objects

00:39:48.626 --> 00:39:49.366 A:middle
that they affect.

00:39:50.596 --> 00:39:52.516 A:middle
Shades go up, and shades go

00:39:52.516 --> 00:39:52.886 A:middle
down.

00:39:53.566 --> 00:39:54.896 A:middle
So it makes sense to use a

00:39:54.896 --> 00:39:56.996 A:middle
control that mirrors that up and

00:39:56.996 --> 00:39:57.896 A:middle
down movement.

00:39:59.326 --> 00:40:01.126 A:middle
There is no ambiguity about how

00:40:01.126 --> 00:40:02.976 A:middle
to raise or lower the shade.

00:40:04.286 --> 00:40:05.896 A:middle
Mapping also relates to how

00:40:05.896 --> 00:40:07.706 A:middle
controls are arranged relative

00:40:07.756 --> 00:40:08.356 A:middle
to each other.

00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:10.526 A:middle
Their order should resemble the

00:40:10.526 --> 00:40:12.306 A:middle
configuration of the objects

00:40:12.306 --> 00:40:12.966 A:middle
that they affect.

00:40:13.766 --> 00:40:15.616 A:middle
So let's say that these light

00:40:15.616 --> 00:40:17.496 A:middle
switches control three sets of

00:40:17.496 --> 00:40:18.856 A:middle
ceiling lights in the bedroom.

00:40:20.226 --> 00:40:21.866 A:middle
Good mapping involves arranging

00:40:21.866 --> 00:40:23.106 A:middle
the switches to mirror the

00:40:23.106 --> 00:40:24.746 A:middle
layout of those lights.

00:40:26.036 --> 00:40:28.076 A:middle
By focusing on mapping, it is so

00:40:28.076 --> 00:40:29.896 A:middle
much easier to make choices

00:40:30.236 --> 00:40:31.406 A:middle
about where to position

00:40:31.406 --> 00:40:33.916 A:middle
controls, how to order them, and

00:40:33.916 --> 00:40:35.816 A:middle
even which controls to use.

00:40:36.456 --> 00:40:37.606 A:middle
I mean, we've all seen light

00:40:37.636 --> 00:40:38.926 A:middle
switches that look like this.

00:40:40.316 --> 00:40:41.876 A:middle
You will often find labels when

00:40:41.876 --> 00:40:43.396 A:middle
mapping is unclear.

00:40:43.396 --> 00:40:44.806 A:middle
It is a telltale sign.

00:40:45.436 --> 00:40:47.116 A:middle
But it is not a particularly

00:40:47.116 --> 00:40:47.976 A:middle
good solution.

00:40:48.566 --> 00:40:49.776 A:middle
Reading takes time, and it

00:40:49.776 --> 00:40:51.106 A:middle
doesn't help people to memorize

00:40:51.146 --> 00:40:53.046 A:middle
the location of controls or how

00:40:53.046 --> 00:40:54.636 A:middle
they should interact with them.

00:40:55.736 --> 00:40:56.566 A:middle
Now, in the context of

00:40:56.566 --> 00:40:57.796 A:middle
interface, adjusting a

00:40:57.796 --> 00:40:59.356 A:middle
horizontal property is much more

00:40:59.356 --> 00:41:01.166 A:middle
intuitive with the horizontal

00:41:01.166 --> 00:41:01.626 A:middle
slider.

00:41:02.456 --> 00:41:03.956 A:middle
Similarly, using a dial for

00:41:03.956 --> 00:41:05.696 A:middle
adjusting rotation is much

00:41:05.696 --> 00:41:07.076 A:middle
better than a slider or a

00:41:07.076 --> 00:41:07.546 A:middle
stepper.

00:41:08.356 --> 00:41:11.046 A:middle
Of course, the best mapping is

00:41:11.186 --> 00:41:12.626 A:middle
the most direct mapping.

00:41:13.276 --> 00:41:14.786 A:middle
Providing the ability for people

00:41:14.786 --> 00:41:16.666 A:middle
to directly manipulate an object

00:41:16.736 --> 00:41:17.926 A:middle
is more straightforward, it's

00:41:17.926 --> 00:41:19.416 A:middle
more intuitive, and precise.

00:41:19.846 --> 00:41:21.026 A:middle
Whether that is with a pointer

00:41:21.026 --> 00:41:24.626 A:middle
on macOS, or Gestures on iOS.

00:41:25.896 --> 00:41:28.086 A:middle
Okay, so enough about light

00:41:28.086 --> 00:41:28.526 A:middle
switches.

00:41:28.526 --> 00:41:30.686 A:middle
I don't know about you, but I am

00:41:30.686 --> 00:41:32.446 A:middle
starving, and it is time to head

00:41:32.446 --> 00:41:34.596 A:middle
downstairs and get some dinner.

00:41:35.496 --> 00:41:36.756 A:middle
Now, we all meet up in the lobby

00:41:36.756 --> 00:41:38.076 A:middle
and we make our way over to the

00:41:38.076 --> 00:41:39.956 A:middle
restaurant, and as you sit down

00:41:39.956 --> 00:41:41.486 A:middle
at the table, you see in front

00:41:41.486 --> 00:41:43.366 A:middle
of you an empty dinner plate.

00:41:44.666 --> 00:41:46.886 A:middle
What can you do with this dinner

00:41:46.916 --> 00:41:47.126 A:middle
plate?

00:41:47.726 --> 00:41:50.626 A:middle
Well, of course, you can put

00:41:50.626 --> 00:41:53.076 A:middle
food on it, #putfoodonit

00:41:53.076 --> 00:41:54.296 A:middle
[laughter].

00:41:54.296 --> 00:41:56.466 A:middle
But you can do all sorts of

00:41:56.466 --> 00:41:57.546 A:middle
other stuff too.

00:41:58.476 --> 00:41:59.916 A:middle
The plate is smooth, so it looks

00:41:59.916 --> 00:42:01.006 A:middle
like it is easy to rotate and

00:42:01.006 --> 00:42:01.676 A:middle
slide around.

00:42:02.676 --> 00:42:04.066 A:middle
There is a nice little gap along

00:42:04.066 --> 00:42:05.436 A:middle
the edge, so it looks easy to

00:42:05.436 --> 00:42:06.796 A:middle
grab and lift up.

00:42:07.716 --> 00:42:09.256 A:middle
It looks like a Frisbee, so you

00:42:09.256 --> 00:42:11.546 A:middle
consider how far you can make it

00:42:12.516 --> 00:42:12.596 A:middle
go.

00:42:12.806 --> 00:42:14.006 A:middle
Or maybe not.

00:42:14.886 --> 00:42:16.416 A:middle
Our notions about how we

00:42:16.416 --> 00:42:18.836 A:middle
interact with this plate are

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:20.246 A:middle
called affordances.

00:42:21.496 --> 00:42:23.186 A:middle
In other words, a plate's

00:42:23.186 --> 00:42:24.966 A:middle
physical characteristics provide

00:42:25.056 --> 00:42:27.876 A:middle
visual and tactile cues about

00:42:27.876 --> 00:42:29.356 A:middle
what interactions the plate

00:42:29.356 --> 00:42:30.626 A:middle
afford to us.

00:42:31.596 --> 00:42:32.576 A:middle
A plate's physical

00:42:32.576 --> 00:42:34.216 A:middle
characteristics make certain

00:42:34.216 --> 00:42:36.016 A:middle
actions seem possible, and

00:42:36.016 --> 00:42:37.286 A:middle
others less possible.

00:42:37.976 --> 00:42:38.896 A:middle
We look at the plate, and we

00:42:38.896 --> 00:42:39.916 A:middle
think, I am going to put food

00:42:39.916 --> 00:42:40.886 A:middle
onto this object.

00:42:41.376 --> 00:42:42.896 A:middle
Or, we might also think, I'm

00:42:42.896 --> 00:42:44.256 A:middle
going to use this object to

00:42:44.296 --> 00:42:45.836 A:middle
transport my food to a different

00:42:45.836 --> 00:42:46.356 A:middle
location.

00:42:47.076 --> 00:42:48.226 A:middle
We don't look at this plate and

00:42:48.226 --> 00:42:49.536 A:middle
think, I'm going to use it for

00:42:49.536 --> 00:42:50.386 A:middle
drinking water.

00:42:51.436 --> 00:42:53.366 A:middle
Affordance is not an attribute

00:42:53.366 --> 00:42:54.646 A:middle
of the object itself.

00:42:55.366 --> 00:42:56.856 A:middle
It is more about the

00:42:56.856 --> 00:42:58.726 A:middle
relationship that individuals

00:42:58.866 --> 00:42:59.946 A:middle
have to an object.

00:43:00.736 --> 00:43:03.806 A:middle
Affordance varies based on one's

00:43:03.856 --> 00:43:05.186 A:middle
physical abilities.

00:43:05.386 --> 00:43:07.246 A:middle
So, therefore, affordance varies

00:43:07.246 --> 00:43:08.436 A:middle
from person to person.

00:43:09.126 --> 00:43:10.636 A:middle
So, for example, this is kind of

00:43:10.636 --> 00:43:11.356 A:middle
an extreme one.

00:43:12.306 --> 00:43:13.846 A:middle
A Frisbee affords me with a

00:43:13.846 --> 00:43:15.486 A:middle
possibility of catching and

00:43:15.486 --> 00:43:15.976 A:middle
throwing.

00:43:16.606 --> 00:43:18.356 A:middle
For my dog, a Frisbee affords

00:43:18.356 --> 00:43:20.276 A:middle
the ability of catching, but not

00:43:20.276 --> 00:43:20.706 A:middle
throwing.

00:43:21.286 --> 00:43:23.556 A:middle
A plate affords me with the

00:43:23.556 --> 00:43:25.466 A:middle
ability of eating food off of

00:43:26.186 --> 00:43:26.253 A:middle
it.

00:43:26.636 --> 00:43:28.226 A:middle
Interestingly, my dog perceives

00:43:28.286 --> 00:43:29.386 A:middle
the very same affordance.

00:43:30.676 --> 00:43:32.446 A:middle
Now, because affordance is

00:43:32.446 --> 00:43:34.476 A:middle
subjective, one person can

00:43:34.476 --> 00:43:35.566 A:middle
perceive an affordance when

00:43:35.566 --> 00:43:36.386 A:middle
another does not.

00:43:36.956 --> 00:43:38.126 A:middle
People are more likely to

00:43:38.126 --> 00:43:39.206 A:middle
perceive an affordance when it

00:43:39.206 --> 00:43:40.776 A:middle
is related to an action that

00:43:40.776 --> 00:43:42.126 A:middle
they are more likely to take.

00:43:42.916 --> 00:43:45.516 A:middle
So, for instance, I could use a

00:43:45.516 --> 00:43:47.256 A:middle
plate as a saucer, and it would

00:43:47.256 --> 00:43:48.696 A:middle
make a really great saucer.

00:43:48.766 --> 00:43:50.236 A:middle
I don't think I would get any

00:43:50.516 --> 00:43:53.386 A:middle
argument from you guys, but this

00:43:53.386 --> 00:43:55.116 A:middle
is an unlikely action to take,

00:43:55.116 --> 00:43:56.876 A:middle
so I wouldn't readily perceive a

00:43:56.876 --> 00:43:58.326 A:middle
plate's glass-putting

00:43:58.326 --> 00:44:00.566 A:middle
affordance, whereas I'm very

00:44:00.566 --> 00:44:01.766 A:middle
likely to put food on it.

00:44:02.066 --> 00:44:03.786 A:middle
So I readily perceive the

00:44:03.786 --> 00:44:05.336 A:middle
plate's food-putting affordance.

00:44:06.636 --> 00:44:08.736 A:middle
You perceive affordances with

00:44:08.736 --> 00:44:10.266 A:middle
every environment and every

00:44:10.266 --> 00:44:11.596 A:middle
object that you have ever

00:44:11.596 --> 00:44:12.426 A:middle
interacted with.

00:44:13.076 --> 00:44:14.166 A:middle
When you walked into the

00:44:14.166 --> 00:44:16.276 A:middle
restaurant, you passed through a

00:44:16.276 --> 00:44:17.566 A:middle
door that afforded you the

00:44:17.566 --> 00:44:18.916 A:middle
ability of passage.

00:44:19.476 --> 00:44:21.096 A:middle
The door is human-sized, so you

00:44:21.096 --> 00:44:22.766 A:middle
can imagine your body moving

00:44:22.816 --> 00:44:24.036 A:middle
through it unobstructed.

00:44:24.606 --> 00:44:26.226 A:middle
There was a continuous grounds

00:44:26.266 --> 00:44:27.746 A:middle
plane, so you can imagine

00:44:27.746 --> 00:44:29.056 A:middle
yourself walking along it,

00:44:29.056 --> 00:44:30.526 A:middle
without stumbling, tripping.

00:44:31.676 --> 00:44:32.966 A:middle
The chair that you sat in

00:44:33.026 --> 00:44:34.886 A:middle
affords the ability for sitting.

00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:37.136 A:middle
The table in front of you

00:44:37.136 --> 00:44:38.616 A:middle
affords the ability of putting

00:44:38.616 --> 00:44:39.696 A:middle
objects onto it.

00:44:40.636 --> 00:44:42.286 A:middle
The ground below your feet

00:44:42.286 --> 00:44:44.176 A:middle
affords the ability for resting

00:44:44.176 --> 00:44:44.556 A:middle
your feet.

00:44:45.836 --> 00:44:47.896 A:middle
Manufactured objects include

00:44:47.896 --> 00:44:49.976 A:middle
cues to evoke affordances.

00:44:51.276 --> 00:44:52.256 A:middle
They let people know what

00:44:52.256 --> 00:44:54.866 A:middle
actions are possible, and the

00:44:54.866 --> 00:44:56.996 A:middle
obviousness and visibility of

00:44:56.996 --> 00:44:58.526 A:middle
those cues helps people to know

00:44:58.526 --> 00:45:00.846 A:middle
the correct or the intended ways

00:45:00.846 --> 00:45:02.846 A:middle
of interacting, and the same

00:45:02.846 --> 00:45:04.096 A:middle
should be true for apps.

00:45:05.376 --> 00:45:07.106 A:middle
Sliders afford dragging a knob

00:45:07.176 --> 00:45:08.436 A:middle
along a track.

00:45:09.016 --> 00:45:10.676 A:middle
Dials afford rotating.

00:45:11.396 --> 00:45:13.546 A:middle
Buttons afford tapping, and

00:45:13.546 --> 00:45:13.916 A:middle
clicking.

00:45:14.956 --> 00:45:16.406 A:middle
In each of these examples,

00:45:16.726 --> 00:45:18.326 A:middle
affordance is communicated with

00:45:18.356 --> 00:45:19.766 A:middle
maximum efficiency.

00:45:20.326 --> 00:45:22.236 A:middle
In fact, over time, we are all

00:45:22.236 --> 00:45:23.726 A:middle
becoming more comfortable with

00:45:23.726 --> 00:45:25.096 A:middle
increasing levels of

00:45:25.096 --> 00:45:25.926 A:middle
abstraction.

00:45:26.606 --> 00:45:28.186 A:middle
The button, after all, is just a

00:45:28.186 --> 00:45:30.386 A:middle
highly abstracted version of a

00:45:30.386 --> 00:45:32.586 A:middle
physical, real-world button.

00:45:33.556 --> 00:45:35.456 A:middle
All that's necessary to create a

00:45:35.456 --> 00:45:36.756 A:middle
strong connection between the

00:45:36.756 --> 00:45:38.176 A:middle
two are the rounding of the

00:45:38.176 --> 00:45:38.816 A:middle
corners.

00:45:39.486 --> 00:45:41.006 A:middle
A subtle drop shadow around the

00:45:41.006 --> 00:45:42.596 A:middle
slider knob separates it from

00:45:42.596 --> 00:45:43.726 A:middle
the track that it is positioned

00:45:43.726 --> 00:45:45.336 A:middle
over, and this separation

00:45:45.336 --> 00:45:46.676 A:middle
suggests that it can be moved

00:45:46.706 --> 00:45:47.506 A:middle
independently.

00:45:48.186 --> 00:45:49.576 A:middle
And even that visual cue might

00:45:49.576 --> 00:45:51.316 A:middle
not be completely necessary.

00:45:51.746 --> 00:45:53.176 A:middle
For most people, simply seeing a

00:45:53.176 --> 00:45:54.686 A:middle
filled-in circle over a line is

00:45:54.686 --> 00:45:56.566 A:middle
all that is needed to express a

00:45:56.566 --> 00:45:57.676 A:middle
sliding affordance.

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:00.236 A:middle
And sometimes affordance is

00:46:00.236 --> 00:46:01.886 A:middle
communicated using animation.

00:46:02.406 --> 00:46:03.956 A:middle
Tapping on the Weather app, we

00:46:04.026 --> 00:46:05.966 A:middle
see it slide up a little bit.

00:46:05.966 --> 00:46:07.456 A:middle
This suggests the possibility

00:46:07.456 --> 00:46:09.186 A:middle
that the content areas can be

00:46:09.186 --> 00:46:09.736 A:middle
scrolled.

00:46:10.586 --> 00:46:14.506 A:middle
And sure enough, they can.

00:46:14.696 --> 00:46:16.066 A:middle
Regardless of the exact

00:46:16.066 --> 00:46:17.496 A:middle
technique that you use, your

00:46:17.616 --> 00:46:19.426 A:middle
app's interface must make clear

00:46:19.426 --> 00:46:21.136 A:middle
what action possibilities it

00:46:21.136 --> 00:46:21.636 A:middle
affords.

00:46:22.416 --> 00:46:24.196 A:middle
If not, people won't know how to

00:46:24.196 --> 00:46:25.516 A:middle
properly interact with it.

00:46:26.026 --> 00:46:27.006 A:middle
They'll interact in ways that

00:46:27.006 --> 00:46:28.356 A:middle
your app doesn't support, and

00:46:28.356 --> 00:46:30.046 A:middle
they'll confuse controls for

00:46:30.046 --> 00:46:31.616 A:middle
non-interactive objects.

00:46:32.566 --> 00:46:35.106 A:middle
Okay. So, now that we know where

00:46:35.106 --> 00:46:37.086 A:middle
our food is supposed to go, it

00:46:37.116 --> 00:46:37.956 A:middle
is time to order.

00:46:38.846 --> 00:46:39.866 A:middle
Now, I am thinking about getting

00:46:39.866 --> 00:46:42.466 A:middle
a cheeseburger because they're

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:44.266 A:middle
delicious, obviously, and when a

00:46:44.266 --> 00:46:45.966 A:middle
waiter comes by to take my

00:46:45.966 --> 00:46:47.856 A:middle
order, I say, "Cheeseburger,

00:46:47.906 --> 00:46:48.196 A:middle
please."

00:46:48.636 --> 00:46:51.066 A:middle
He then asks how I would like it

00:46:51.066 --> 00:46:52.566 A:middle
cooked, and "medium," I say.

00:46:53.356 --> 00:46:54.236 A:middle
He then asks what kind of

00:46:54.236 --> 00:46:55.646 A:middle
cheese, cheddar, Swiss, Jack,

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:56.586 A:middle
Gruyere, cottage?

00:46:57.246 --> 00:46:58.456 A:middle
"Cheddar," I say.

00:46:59.516 --> 00:47:00.656 A:middle
He then asks whether I would

00:47:00.656 --> 00:47:03.116 A:middle
like bacon, egg, avocado on it?

00:47:03.726 --> 00:47:04.826 A:middle
"None," I say.

00:47:05.016 --> 00:47:06.686 A:middle
I am trying to keep my figure.

00:47:08.186 --> 00:47:09.406 A:middle
He then asks whether I'd like

00:47:09.406 --> 00:47:11.346 A:middle
salad, fries or onion rings.

00:47:12.066 --> 00:47:13.236 A:middle
"Onion rings," I say.

00:47:14.036 --> 00:47:15.506 A:middle
He then asks if I realize that

00:47:15.506 --> 00:47:16.746 A:middle
cheeseburgers and onion rings

00:47:16.746 --> 00:47:18.896 A:middle
are very high in calories, to

00:47:18.896 --> 00:47:20.656 A:middle
which I reply, "Fake news"

00:47:20.656 --> 00:47:21.816 A:middle
[laughter].

00:47:21.816 --> 00:47:32.646 A:middle
This [applause] in a nutshell is

00:47:32.646 --> 00:47:34.206 A:middle
the principle of progressive

00:47:34.206 --> 00:47:34.836 A:middle
disclosure.

00:47:35.656 --> 00:47:37.036 A:middle
Progressive disclosure is a

00:47:37.036 --> 00:47:38.526 A:middle
technique for managing

00:47:38.526 --> 00:47:39.226 A:middle
complexity.

00:47:39.926 --> 00:47:41.546 A:middle
The term is used almost

00:47:41.546 --> 00:47:43.286 A:middle
exclusively in the context of

00:47:43.286 --> 00:47:45.066 A:middle
interaction design, and to my

00:47:45.066 --> 00:47:46.196 A:middle
knowledge, this is the first

00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:48.236 A:middle
time that anyone was dumb enough

00:47:48.236 --> 00:47:49.346 A:middle
to try to use it to describe

00:47:49.346 --> 00:47:50.336 A:middle
ordering a cheeseburger.

00:47:51.346 --> 00:47:52.926 A:middle
The basic idea is this.

00:47:53.756 --> 00:47:55.716 A:middle
Progressive disclosure gradually

00:47:55.716 --> 00:47:57.666 A:middle
eases people from the simple to

00:47:57.666 --> 00:47:58.756 A:middle
the more complex.

00:47:59.856 --> 00:48:01.546 A:middle
And progressive disclosure is

00:48:01.636 --> 00:48:03.276 A:middle
also about hiding away

00:48:03.276 --> 00:48:05.116 A:middle
complexity, so that people can

00:48:05.116 --> 00:48:07.026 A:middle
accomplish basic tasks with

00:48:07.026 --> 00:48:09.176 A:middle
simple and more approachable

00:48:09.176 --> 00:48:09.966 A:middle
interfaces.

00:48:11.026 --> 00:48:12.406 A:middle
Ordering a cheeseburger would be

00:48:12.496 --> 00:48:14.656 A:middle
way more complex and daunting if

00:48:14.656 --> 00:48:15.886 A:middle
you had to consider all of those

00:48:15.886 --> 00:48:16.816 A:middle
options at once.

00:48:17.296 --> 00:48:18.856 A:middle
Customizing your cheeseburger is

00:48:18.856 --> 00:48:20.396 A:middle
way easier when someone steps

00:48:20.396 --> 00:48:22.196 A:middle
you through the process one

00:48:22.196 --> 00:48:23.306 A:middle
decision at a time.

00:48:24.156 --> 00:48:25.506 A:middle
And some choices that you make

00:48:25.506 --> 00:48:27.296 A:middle
early on could make other

00:48:27.296 --> 00:48:28.816 A:middle
choices irrelevant later.

00:48:29.496 --> 00:48:31.776 A:middle
So, for example, if I'd asked

00:48:31.846 --> 00:48:33.576 A:middle
for French fries, the waiter

00:48:33.576 --> 00:48:35.116 A:middle
would have then asked whether I

00:48:35.116 --> 00:48:37.276 A:middle
wanted regular, truffle or

00:48:37.276 --> 00:48:39.136 A:middle
garlic fries, and because I

00:48:39.136 --> 00:48:40.906 A:middle
didn't ask for fries, I don't

00:48:40.906 --> 00:48:42.596 A:middle
really care what kind of French

00:48:42.596 --> 00:48:44.736 A:middle
fries they have, and telling me

00:48:44.736 --> 00:48:46.466 A:middle
about those options would just

00:48:46.466 --> 00:48:48.176 A:middle
be a waste of my time and my

00:48:48.176 --> 00:48:49.646 A:middle
limited mental abilities.

00:48:51.896 --> 00:48:52.976 A:middle
Or would it be?

00:48:53.856 --> 00:48:55.786 A:middle
I mean, I like garlic fries a

00:48:55.786 --> 00:48:58.116 A:middle
lot, and had I known that garlic

00:48:58.116 --> 00:48:59.936 A:middle
fries were on offer, I would

00:48:59.936 --> 00:49:00.666 A:middle
have gotten them.

00:49:01.426 --> 00:49:04.086 A:middle
So herein lies the rub.

00:49:05.586 --> 00:49:06.926 A:middle
Progressive disclosure is a

00:49:06.926 --> 00:49:08.726 A:middle
necessary and helpful technique

00:49:09.036 --> 00:49:11.346 A:middle
for managing complexity and

00:49:11.346 --> 00:49:12.906 A:middle
simplifying decision making.

00:49:13.586 --> 00:49:15.966 A:middle
But the same technique can bury

00:49:15.966 --> 00:49:17.596 A:middle
information or functionality.

00:49:18.326 --> 00:49:19.436 A:middle
So what do you do?

00:49:20.816 --> 00:49:22.126 A:middle
Well, discussions about how to

00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:23.276 A:middle
properly use progressive

00:49:23.276 --> 00:49:24.866 A:middle
disclosure often come down to

00:49:24.866 --> 00:49:25.776 A:middle
the 80/20 rule.

00:49:26.456 --> 00:49:27.556 A:middle
If you're not familiar, the

00:49:27.556 --> 00:49:29.696 A:middle
80/20 rule is a design principle

00:49:29.976 --> 00:49:33.076 A:middle
that says in essence 80 percent

00:49:33.076 --> 00:49:35.236 A:middle
of a system's effects come from

00:49:35.236 --> 00:49:37.396 A:middle
20 percent of its causes.

00:49:38.506 --> 00:49:40.166 A:middle
For an app, this might mean that

00:49:40.166 --> 00:49:42.606 A:middle
80 percent of its benefit comes

00:49:42.606 --> 00:49:44.586 A:middle
from 20 percent of the actions

00:49:44.586 --> 00:49:47.166 A:middle
that it presents, or 80 percent

00:49:47.166 --> 00:49:48.876 A:middle
of the people who use an app are

00:49:48.876 --> 00:49:51.346 A:middle
only going to use 20 percent of

00:49:51.346 --> 00:49:52.126 A:middle
its functions.

00:49:52.946 --> 00:49:55.026 A:middle
Now, the exact percentages are,

00:49:55.026 --> 00:49:56.026 A:middle
of course, different.

00:49:56.326 --> 00:49:58.086 A:middle
But the basic point is valid.

00:49:58.596 --> 00:49:59.956 A:middle
Not all information or

00:49:59.956 --> 00:50:02.016 A:middle
functionality are created equal.

00:50:02.296 --> 00:50:04.566 A:middle
Some is much more important than

00:50:04.566 --> 00:50:05.066 A:middle
others.

00:50:06.186 --> 00:50:08.756 A:middle
So, in order to reduce clutter,

00:50:09.126 --> 00:50:10.656 A:middle
and simplify decision-making, it

00:50:10.656 --> 00:50:12.256 A:middle
is a really good thing to use

00:50:12.256 --> 00:50:14.336 A:middle
progressive disclosure to hide

00:50:14.336 --> 00:50:15.826 A:middle
things of lesser importance.

00:50:16.946 --> 00:50:18.546 A:middle
In other words, if your app is

00:50:18.546 --> 00:50:21.036 A:middle
complex, it is okay to make the

00:50:21.036 --> 00:50:22.756 A:middle
most useful 20 percent of

00:50:22.756 --> 00:50:25.186 A:middle
functions easier to find by

00:50:25.186 --> 00:50:27.056 A:middle
hiding the other 80 percent.

00:50:28.096 --> 00:50:29.946 A:middle
A classic example of this is the

00:50:29.946 --> 00:50:30.736 A:middle
print dialogue.

00:50:31.346 --> 00:50:33.106 A:middle
Most of the time, people only

00:50:33.106 --> 00:50:35.146 A:middle
care about the basics, which

00:50:35.146 --> 00:50:36.586 A:middle
printer they're printing to, how

00:50:36.586 --> 00:50:38.186 A:middle
many copies, what the range of

00:50:38.216 --> 00:50:39.016 A:middle
pages are.

00:50:39.806 --> 00:50:41.916 A:middle
These are way less than 20

00:50:41.916 --> 00:50:42.916 A:middle
percent of the functions

00:50:42.916 --> 00:50:44.836 A:middle
available, and it is what people

00:50:44.836 --> 00:50:47.096 A:middle
want way more than 80 percent of

00:50:47.096 --> 00:50:47.546 A:middle
the time.

00:50:48.516 --> 00:50:50.306 A:middle
When more control is needed, a

00:50:50.306 --> 00:50:51.936 A:middle
bunch of options are just one

00:50:51.936 --> 00:50:52.486 A:middle
click away.

00:50:52.956 --> 00:50:55.036 A:middle
Not only does progressive

00:50:55.036 --> 00:50:56.686 A:middle
disclosure reduce visual

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:58.866 A:middle
clutter, and make printing less

00:50:58.906 --> 00:51:01.296 A:middle
difficult, it also lowers the

00:51:01.296 --> 00:51:02.556 A:middle
likelihood of people getting

00:51:02.556 --> 00:51:04.746 A:middle
confused and changing a setting

00:51:04.746 --> 00:51:05.476 A:middle
that they don't really

00:51:05.476 --> 00:51:06.196 A:middle
understand.

00:51:07.216 --> 00:51:08.706 A:middle
Most of us have experienced

00:51:08.706 --> 00:51:10.426 A:middle
receiving this call from a

00:51:10.426 --> 00:51:12.076 A:middle
parent, or a family member, or a

00:51:12.076 --> 00:51:14.316 A:middle
friend, who is kind of freaking

00:51:14.316 --> 00:51:15.926 A:middle
out because their computer is

00:51:15.926 --> 00:51:17.556 A:middle
not working properly, and they

00:51:17.556 --> 00:51:18.616 A:middle
changed something, and they

00:51:18.616 --> 00:51:19.776 A:middle
don't really know what they did.

00:51:20.576 --> 00:51:22.646 A:middle
This is why progressive

00:51:22.646 --> 00:51:24.906 A:middle
disclosure is your best friend.

00:51:25.856 --> 00:51:27.386 A:middle
By keeping things simple for

00:51:27.386 --> 00:51:29.776 A:middle
novices, they are less likely to

00:51:29.776 --> 00:51:31.756 A:middle
feel intimidated, overwhelmed,

00:51:32.106 --> 00:51:33.466 A:middle
or get themselves into trouble,

00:51:33.996 --> 00:51:35.426 A:middle
while more experienced users can

00:51:35.426 --> 00:51:37.216 A:middle
quickly reveal the options and

00:51:37.216 --> 00:51:39.516 A:middle
actions that they require, that

00:51:39.936 --> 00:51:41.216 A:middle
they understand, and that they

00:51:41.216 --> 00:51:42.506 A:middle
are capable of using.

00:51:43.766 --> 00:51:47.396 A:middle
Okay. Anyhow, in case you were

00:51:47.396 --> 00:51:49.106 A:middle
wondering, the cheeseburger and

00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:50.546 A:middle
onion rings were delicious,

00:51:51.046 --> 00:51:52.256 A:middle
thank you very much for asking.

00:51:53.336 --> 00:51:55.686 A:middle
Okay, so it is time for us to

00:51:55.686 --> 00:51:56.406 A:middle
get some sleep.

00:51:56.406 --> 00:51:58.046 A:middle
We will be getting up early

00:51:58.046 --> 00:51:59.136 A:middle
tomorrow, and we are going to be

00:51:59.136 --> 00:52:01.486 A:middle
doing some snorkeling, so guys,

00:52:01.486 --> 00:52:01.906 A:middle
rest up.

00:52:02.986 --> 00:52:04.796 A:middle
Okay, did everyone sleep well?

00:52:05.396 --> 00:52:06.896 A:middle
Was your room comfortable?

00:52:06.896 --> 00:52:08.126 A:middle
Were you able to turn on your

00:52:08.126 --> 00:52:09.306 A:middle
lights successfully?

00:52:09.636 --> 00:52:11.086 A:middle
How is that Morty faucet?

00:52:11.086 --> 00:52:12.406 A:middle
That was pretty weird, right?

00:52:13.046 --> 00:52:14.206 A:middle
Okay, enough small talk.

00:52:14.206 --> 00:52:15.866 A:middle
It is time for us to go see some

00:52:15.866 --> 00:52:16.296 A:middle
fish.

00:52:16.796 --> 00:52:18.116 A:middle
Now, after another highly

00:52:18.156 --> 00:52:20.036 A:middle
successful car ride, we get to

00:52:20.036 --> 00:52:21.806 A:middle
the beach, and you put on your

00:52:21.806 --> 00:52:22.856 A:middle
goggles, and you put on your

00:52:22.916 --> 00:52:24.616 A:middle
flippers, you adjust your

00:52:24.616 --> 00:52:26.696 A:middle
snorkel just so, and you get

00:52:26.696 --> 00:52:27.786 A:middle
into the water.

00:52:27.786 --> 00:52:29.526 A:middle
Now, there are some tropical

00:52:29.526 --> 00:52:30.236 A:middle
fish.

00:52:30.716 --> 00:52:32.566 A:middle
There is a blowfish.

00:52:33.046 --> 00:52:35.096 A:middle
There is a school of tuna fish.

00:52:35.906 --> 00:52:38.396 A:middle
There is a giant squid, for some

00:52:38.396 --> 00:52:40.606 A:middle
reason, because I had the emoji

00:52:40.606 --> 00:52:41.796 A:middle
[laughter].

00:52:41.796 --> 00:52:44.756 A:middle
It is a magical underwater

00:52:44.756 --> 00:52:45.486 A:middle
wonderland.

00:52:46.516 --> 00:52:49.666 A:middle
It is so utterly beautiful, but

00:52:49.666 --> 00:52:50.096 A:middle
why?

00:52:51.506 --> 00:52:53.466 A:middle
This brings us to our very last

00:52:53.496 --> 00:52:54.386 A:middle
design principle.

00:52:55.146 --> 00:52:58.046 A:middle
Symmetry. Symmetry is a concept

00:52:58.046 --> 00:52:59.526 A:middle
that we are all deeply familiar

00:52:59.526 --> 00:53:01.256 A:middle
with, and when we think about

00:53:01.256 --> 00:53:02.566 A:middle
symmetry, we typically think

00:53:02.566 --> 00:53:04.756 A:middle
about reflectional or bilateral

00:53:04.826 --> 00:53:05.296 A:middle
symmetry.

00:53:05.976 --> 00:53:06.926 A:middle
But there is more.

00:53:07.656 --> 00:53:09.436 A:middle
There is also radial, and

00:53:09.436 --> 00:53:10.626 A:middle
rotational symmetry.

00:53:11.536 --> 00:53:13.546 A:middle
And there is also translational

00:53:13.646 --> 00:53:14.106 A:middle
symmetry.

00:53:16.096 --> 00:53:17.936 A:middle
These three types of symmetry

00:53:18.366 --> 00:53:19.656 A:middle
are ubiquitous in nature.

00:53:20.206 --> 00:53:21.896 A:middle
Symmetrical forms are efficient

00:53:21.966 --> 00:53:23.826 A:middle
forms, and we tend to associate

00:53:23.826 --> 00:53:25.186 A:middle
them with good health, with

00:53:25.186 --> 00:53:27.026 A:middle
stability, balance, and

00:53:27.026 --> 00:53:27.846 A:middle
orderliness.

00:53:28.456 --> 00:53:29.966 A:middle
And we consider them to be

00:53:29.966 --> 00:53:32.136 A:middle
aesthetically pleasing, probably

00:53:32.136 --> 00:53:33.636 A:middle
for very good evolutionary

00:53:33.636 --> 00:53:34.286 A:middle
reasons.

00:53:35.206 --> 00:53:37.016 A:middle
Symmetrical elements, even if

00:53:37.016 --> 00:53:38.146 A:middle
they are not physically

00:53:38.146 --> 00:53:39.876 A:middle
connected to each other, are

00:53:39.876 --> 00:53:41.726 A:middle
perceived as though they are.

00:53:42.506 --> 00:53:44.776 A:middle
So when we see these two facing

00:53:44.776 --> 00:53:46.996 A:middle
square brackets, our mind

00:53:46.996 --> 00:53:48.796 A:middle
unconsciously integrates them

00:53:49.186 --> 00:53:51.696 A:middle
into one coherent object.

00:53:52.836 --> 00:53:54.526 A:middle
And as you swim around, you'll

00:53:54.526 --> 00:53:56.176 A:middle
find all three forms of

00:53:56.176 --> 00:53:56.746 A:middle
symmetry.

00:53:57.906 --> 00:54:00.986 A:middle
Bilateral symmetry, rotational

00:54:00.986 --> 00:54:03.676 A:middle
symmetry, and translational

00:54:03.676 --> 00:54:04.146 A:middle
symmetry.

00:54:05.236 --> 00:54:07.026 A:middle
As a matter of fact, just about

00:54:07.026 --> 00:54:08.526 A:middle
every type of plant or animal,

00:54:08.526 --> 00:54:11.166 A:middle
both in the sea, in the water,

00:54:11.166 --> 00:54:12.776 A:middle
on land, in the air,

00:54:13.056 --> 00:54:14.936 A:middle
demonstrates one or more types

00:54:14.976 --> 00:54:15.696 A:middle
of symmetry.

00:54:16.196 --> 00:54:18.216 A:middle
And most human-made objects do

00:54:18.216 --> 00:54:18.746 A:middle
as well.

00:54:19.536 --> 00:54:21.396 A:middle
Light switches are symmetrical

00:54:21.396 --> 00:54:23.426 A:middle
across both the horizontal and

00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:24.326 A:middle
vertical axes.

00:54:25.266 --> 00:54:26.996 A:middle
Faucets are symmetrical.

00:54:27.756 --> 00:54:29.506 A:middle
And cars are symmetrical.

00:54:29.506 --> 00:54:31.636 A:middle
[Laughs] Now there is obviously

00:54:31.636 --> 00:54:34.406 A:middle
some very practical functional

00:54:34.406 --> 00:54:36.626 A:middle
reasons why cars are

00:54:36.626 --> 00:54:37.336 A:middle
symmetrical.

00:54:37.996 --> 00:54:40.846 A:middle
I mean, there is a very rational

00:54:40.846 --> 00:54:42.126 A:middle
reason why you don't want to get

00:54:42.126 --> 00:54:44.066 A:middle
into that car.

00:54:44.256 --> 00:54:47.386 A:middle
But there are clearly aesthetic

00:54:47.386 --> 00:54:48.326 A:middle
benefits as well.

00:54:49.116 --> 00:54:51.036 A:middle
Attractive interfaces tend to

00:54:51.036 --> 00:54:52.446 A:middle
demonstrate a mixture of

00:54:52.446 --> 00:54:54.236 A:middle
reflectional and translational

00:54:54.236 --> 00:54:54.786 A:middle
symmetry.

00:54:55.246 --> 00:54:56.716 A:middle
In the Weather app, reflectional

00:54:56.716 --> 00:54:58.106 A:middle
symmetry provides a sense of

00:54:58.166 --> 00:54:58.716 A:middle
balance.

00:54:59.286 --> 00:55:01.116 A:middle
Key elements are centered along

00:55:01.116 --> 00:55:03.526 A:middle
a median line, while almost all

00:55:03.526 --> 00:55:04.526 A:middle
of the other elements are

00:55:04.526 --> 00:55:05.856 A:middle
counter-balanced with each

00:55:05.856 --> 00:55:06.116 A:middle
other.

00:55:07.226 --> 00:55:08.306 A:middle
This is a pattern which is

00:55:08.306 --> 00:55:10.216 A:middle
reflected in apps like the

00:55:10.216 --> 00:55:14.246 A:middle
Camera app, the Clock app, and

00:55:14.246 --> 00:55:16.496 A:middle
the Phone app, and many, many

00:55:16.496 --> 00:55:16.816 A:middle
more.

00:55:18.216 --> 00:55:20.276 A:middle
Translational symmetry gives an

00:55:20.276 --> 00:55:22.136 A:middle
interface a sense of structure,

00:55:22.356 --> 00:55:24.166 A:middle
and order through the repetition

00:55:24.166 --> 00:55:25.356 A:middle
of like elements.

00:55:26.136 --> 00:55:27.486 A:middle
You can see translational

00:55:27.486 --> 00:55:29.366 A:middle
symmetry in the even repetition

00:55:29.366 --> 00:55:31.126 A:middle
of cities and times in the Clock

00:55:31.126 --> 00:55:33.876 A:middle
app, or the even cadence of

00:55:33.876 --> 00:55:35.346 A:middle
locations in the Weather app.

00:55:36.586 --> 00:55:37.676 A:middle
When laying out your app's

00:55:37.676 --> 00:55:39.146 A:middle
interface, look for

00:55:39.146 --> 00:55:41.586 A:middle
opportunities to use symmetry to

00:55:41.586 --> 00:55:43.206 A:middle
provide a sense of balance and

00:55:43.206 --> 00:55:43.556 A:middle
order.

00:55:44.606 --> 00:55:47.536 A:middle
Okay, so, everyone, I am sorry

00:55:47.536 --> 00:55:48.736 A:middle
to be the bearer of bad news,

00:55:48.736 --> 00:55:50.786 A:middle
but it's time for us to get out

00:55:50.786 --> 00:55:51.306 A:middle
of the water.

00:55:51.306 --> 00:55:52.706 A:middle
There are a lot of you, and we

00:55:52.706 --> 00:55:53.816 A:middle
can only pay for a half day

00:55:53.816 --> 00:55:54.076 A:middle
trip.

00:55:54.746 --> 00:55:56.206 A:middle
Also, I don't know if you saw,

00:55:56.206 --> 00:55:57.496 A:middle
there was a shark in the water,

00:55:57.496 --> 00:55:58.626 A:middle
and I am really starting to

00:55:58.626 --> 00:55:59.086 A:middle
freak out.

00:55:59.576 --> 00:56:03.496 A:middle
So we return back to sunny San

00:56:03.496 --> 00:56:03.936 A:middle
Jose.

00:56:04.596 --> 00:56:06.186 A:middle
Now, the snorkeling here is not

00:56:06.186 --> 00:56:07.606 A:middle
quite as beautiful as Hawaii,

00:56:07.606 --> 00:56:09.506 A:middle
and I strongly urge you not to

00:56:09.506 --> 00:56:10.246 A:middle
go into the bay.

00:56:10.736 --> 00:56:12.096 A:middle
But our technical and design

00:56:12.096 --> 00:56:14.516 A:middle
content is way better, so it's a

00:56:14.516 --> 00:56:14.966 A:middle
win-win.

00:56:15.846 --> 00:56:17.226 A:middle
Now, the design principles that

00:56:17.226 --> 00:56:18.836 A:middle
we explored today express

00:56:18.916 --> 00:56:21.126 A:middle
fundamental truths about human

00:56:21.126 --> 00:56:22.616 A:middle
perception and cognition.

00:56:23.516 --> 00:56:25.466 A:middle
They are simple, but powerful

00:56:25.466 --> 00:56:27.536 A:middle
reminders about the true nature

00:56:27.846 --> 00:56:29.376 A:middle
and purpose of design.

00:56:30.206 --> 00:56:31.806 A:middle
They provide a framework for

00:56:31.806 --> 00:56:33.796 A:middle
understanding, and a language

00:56:33.876 --> 00:56:36.136 A:middle
for articulating a design's

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:38.486 A:middle
strengths and its shortcomings.

00:56:39.446 --> 00:56:41.336 A:middle
My hope is that in sharing these

00:56:41.336 --> 00:56:42.806 A:middle
principles with you today, you

00:56:43.746 --> 00:56:45.496 A:middle
will come away with a clear

00:56:45.496 --> 00:56:48.256 A:middle
sense of how your app's designs

00:56:48.736 --> 00:56:50.966 A:middle
can help to fulfill those basic

00:56:50.966 --> 00:56:53.066 A:middle
needs that we all share.

00:56:53.816 --> 00:56:55.356 A:middle
The need to feel safe.

00:56:55.706 --> 00:56:57.256 A:middle
The need to understand.

00:56:57.526 --> 00:56:59.376 A:middle
The need to achieve our goals,

00:56:59.686 --> 00:57:01.306 A:middle
and the need to experience

00:57:01.366 --> 00:57:02.946 A:middle
beauty and joy.

00:57:04.286 --> 00:57:05.826 A:middle
Now, to be sure, while these

00:57:05.826 --> 00:57:07.146 A:middle
principles are, in many ways,

00:57:07.146 --> 00:57:08.566 A:middle
quite simple, applying them to

00:57:08.596 --> 00:57:09.926 A:middle
your work is not.

00:57:11.156 --> 00:57:12.486 A:middle
Each of these principles could

00:57:12.486 --> 00:57:13.686 A:middle
lead you into different

00:57:13.686 --> 00:57:15.486 A:middle
directions about what you should

00:57:15.486 --> 00:57:17.066 A:middle
do with the design of your app.

00:57:18.116 --> 00:57:20.196 A:middle
Designing is so often about

00:57:20.196 --> 00:57:21.776 A:middle
resolving those differences.

00:57:22.416 --> 00:57:23.896 A:middle
This is something that the very

00:57:23.896 --> 00:57:25.526 A:middle
best designers struggle with.

00:57:26.806 --> 00:57:28.676 A:middle
It is also possible to have too

00:57:28.676 --> 00:57:29.566 A:middle
much of a good thing.

00:57:29.966 --> 00:57:31.376 A:middle
Too much feedback is annoying.

00:57:31.416 --> 00:57:32.896 A:middle
Too much visibility is

00:57:32.936 --> 00:57:33.556 A:middle
distracting.

00:57:33.836 --> 00:57:35.486 A:middle
Too much progressive disclosure

00:57:35.786 --> 00:57:37.596 A:middle
can make work flows inefficient.

00:57:38.336 --> 00:57:39.866 A:middle
So you have to be measured in

00:57:39.866 --> 00:57:41.846 A:middle
your approach, and exercise

00:57:41.936 --> 00:57:43.646 A:middle
judgment and discretion.

00:57:44.696 --> 00:57:46.006 A:middle
And the relevance of each

00:57:46.006 --> 00:57:48.096 A:middle
principle can vary depending on

00:57:48.096 --> 00:57:49.596 A:middle
what kind of app you're making.

00:57:50.606 --> 00:57:52.376 A:middle
Platform. Screen size.

00:57:52.776 --> 00:57:55.556 A:middle
Use case. The experience level

00:57:55.556 --> 00:57:56.356 A:middle
of the people who you are

00:57:56.356 --> 00:57:57.256 A:middle
designing for.

00:57:57.886 --> 00:57:59.816 A:middle
These factors and more should

00:57:59.816 --> 00:58:01.736 A:middle
influence what principles are

00:58:01.736 --> 00:58:03.616 A:middle
most relevant at any given

00:58:03.616 --> 00:58:03.986 A:middle
moment.

00:58:05.076 --> 00:58:06.636 A:middle
Working through this can be

00:58:06.636 --> 00:58:07.266 A:middle
challenging.

00:58:07.996 --> 00:58:09.276 A:middle
No one said that designing is

00:58:09.276 --> 00:58:11.966 A:middle
easy, but I do not want you to

00:58:11.966 --> 00:58:12.986 A:middle
be discouraged.

00:58:13.706 --> 00:58:15.576 A:middle
Designing is a lot easier when

00:58:15.576 --> 00:58:17.926 A:middle
you understand the fundamentals.

00:58:18.666 --> 00:58:20.456 A:middle
Let these principles be your

00:58:20.456 --> 00:58:21.416 A:middle
North Star.

00:58:22.106 --> 00:58:23.386 A:middle
They will guide you toward

00:58:23.386 --> 00:58:25.946 A:middle
making apps that better serve

00:58:26.446 --> 00:58:27.996 A:middle
the human beings that you are

00:58:27.996 --> 00:58:28.876 A:middle
designing for.

00:58:29.776 --> 00:58:31.396 A:middle
And that is the thing that

00:58:31.396 --> 00:58:32.366 A:middle
matters most.

00:58:33.476 --> 00:58:35.406 A:middle
And in turn, the people that you

00:58:35.406 --> 00:58:36.516 A:middle
are designing for will

00:58:36.516 --> 00:58:39.366 A:middle
recognize, on some level, all of

00:58:39.366 --> 00:58:40.846 A:middle
the hard work that you have

00:58:40.846 --> 00:58:41.456 A:middle
invested.

00:58:42.046 --> 00:58:43.306 A:middle
They will appreciate the

00:58:43.446 --> 00:58:46.236 A:middle
thoughtfulness and care, and

00:58:46.586 --> 00:58:49.216 A:middle
they will sense the humanity of

00:58:49.336 --> 00:58:51.526 A:middle
the people who made it.

00:58:52.576 --> 00:58:55.186 A:middle
Okay, so for more information,

00:58:55.326 --> 00:58:56.256 A:middle
check out this URL.

00:58:56.786 --> 00:58:58.966 A:middle
And, I want to highlight how

00:58:58.966 --> 00:59:00.656 A:middle
many amazing design sessions we

00:59:00.656 --> 00:59:01.416 A:middle
have for you this week.

00:59:01.826 --> 00:59:03.946 A:middle
We actually have eight design

00:59:03.946 --> 00:59:06.246 A:middle
sessions, which is more than we

00:59:06.246 --> 00:59:07.186 A:middle
have ever done before.

00:59:07.186 --> 00:59:08.556 A:middle
We have three sessions that have

00:59:08.646 --> 00:59:10.986 A:middle
five mini sessions in them each.

00:59:10.986 --> 00:59:12.256 A:middle
There is a lot of fantastic

00:59:12.256 --> 00:59:12.736 A:middle
content.

00:59:13.176 --> 00:59:14.466 A:middle
In particular, I want to

00:59:14.466 --> 00:59:16.286 A:middle
highlight a couple of sessions.

00:59:16.776 --> 00:59:18.426 A:middle
One is called Designing Sound.

00:59:18.456 --> 00:59:21.216 A:middle
It is being given by the person

00:59:21.216 --> 00:59:22.736 A:middle
who makes basically all the

00:59:22.736 --> 00:59:24.286 A:middle
sounds that are on your devices.

00:59:24.596 --> 00:59:26.376 A:middle
It is nothing, like nothing we

00:59:26.376 --> 00:59:27.256 A:middle
have ever done before.

00:59:27.576 --> 00:59:28.556 A:middle
It is really fantastic.

00:59:28.556 --> 00:59:29.496 A:middle
It is this afternoon.

00:59:30.046 --> 00:59:31.656 A:middle
And you should go check out

00:59:31.686 --> 00:59:33.546 A:middle
tomorrow, a presentation called

00:59:33.546 --> 00:59:35.076 A:middle
Designing Across Platforms,

00:59:35.666 --> 00:59:37.266 A:middle
which helps to solve really

00:59:37.266 --> 00:59:39.266 A:middle
tricky issues about how to adapt

00:59:39.266 --> 00:59:41.096 A:middle
your app to different platforms.

00:59:41.096 --> 00:59:42.586 A:middle
It is really awesome.

00:59:43.356 --> 00:59:44.956 A:middle
Okay, you guys, it has really

00:59:44.956 --> 00:59:46.536 A:middle
been an honor and my pleasure to

00:59:46.536 --> 00:59:47.296 A:middle
talk with you today.

00:59:47.606 --> 00:59:48.426 A:middle
Thank you so much.

00:59:49.516 --> 00:59:55.170 A:middle
