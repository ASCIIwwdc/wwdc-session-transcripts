[ Cheering ]

00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:22.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Today I am going to talk

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:23.886 A:middle
about iMessage apps.

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.656 A:middle
The iMessage App Store is only a

00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:27.116 A:middle
year old, and there are already

00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:28.806 A:middle
so many great apps, and so many

00:00:28.806 --> 00:00:29.796 A:middle
new experiences.

00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:31.636 A:middle
There are also many more yet to

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:32.346 A:middle
be discovered.

00:00:32.606 --> 00:00:33.866 A:middle
An essential part of the

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.006 A:middle
iMessage App experience is

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:36.486 A:middle
Stickers.

00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:38.556 A:middle
Stickers have done so much to

00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:39.846 A:middle
brighten our conversations.

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:41.026 A:middle
There are so many different

00:00:41.026 --> 00:00:42.676 A:middle
types of Stickers, even animated

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:43.066 A:middle
ones.

00:00:43.296 --> 00:00:44.356 A:middle
Look at all the Stickers here.

00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:45.766 A:middle
And these are only the Apple

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:46.256 A:middle
ones.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.546 A:middle
Let's take a look at what makes

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:48.166 A:middle
them so great.

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:50.416 A:middle
Going to jump into a

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:51.996 A:middle
conversation, and my friend sent

00:00:51.996 --> 00:00:53.386 A:middle
me this image of a show that we

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:53.806 A:middle
went to.

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:54.536 A:middle
I'm going to react with a

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:54.966 A:middle
Sticker.

00:00:56.536 --> 00:00:58.086 A:middle
Going to pick this thumbs-up one

00:00:58.086 --> 00:01:00.516 A:middle
here, tap and hold to peel, and

00:01:00.516 --> 00:01:02.286 A:middle
put it where I want it, scale,

00:01:02.286 --> 00:01:03.706 A:middle
rotate, and drop it there.

00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:05.076 A:middle
I'm going to add another

00:01:05.076 --> 00:01:06.686 A:middle
Sticker, just to be extra fun

00:01:06.686 --> 00:01:07.076 A:middle
with it.

00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:08.416 A:middle
Pick this one.

00:01:08.416 --> 00:01:09.316 A:middle
And I think I'm going to send

00:01:09.316 --> 00:01:10.436 A:middle
this one with a full screen

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:10.776 A:middle
effect.

00:01:12.136 --> 00:01:13.286 A:middle
This new echo one that Mac

00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:14.046 A:middle
worked on is great.

00:01:16.816 --> 00:01:17.956 A:middle
What makes the Sticker

00:01:17.956 --> 00:01:19.666 A:middle
experience so effective is that

00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:20.146 A:middle
it's flexible.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.866 A:middle
With the expandable App drawer,

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.256 A:middle
I can use the half screen and

00:01:24.256 --> 00:01:26.186 A:middle
full screen view to find exactly

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.186 A:middle
the Sticker that I want.

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:28.116 A:middle
It is fast.

00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:29.516 A:middle
It is easy, and light.

00:01:30.536 --> 00:01:32.256 A:middle
In other words, it's convenient.

00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:36.096 A:middle
Prior to Stickers, you could not

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.496 A:middle
respond to an older bubble in

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:38.586 A:middle
the conversation, and you

00:01:38.586 --> 00:01:40.066 A:middle
definitely couldn't overlay

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.296 A:middle
images on top of bubbles.

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:42.726 A:middle
That is a game changer.

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:44.516 A:middle
I could pick my Sticker, and put

00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:45.796 A:middle
it exactly where I want it,

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:47.436 A:middle
transforming the conversation

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:48.716 A:middle
for both of us to enjoy.

00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:53.466 A:middle
Using Stickers is playful, and

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:53.866 A:middle
personal.

00:01:55.796 --> 00:01:56.936 A:middle
There are so many different

00:01:56.936 --> 00:01:58.266 A:middle
types of ways to send Stickers,

00:01:58.426 --> 00:02:00.106 A:middle
expressing yourself in unique

00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:01.766 A:middle
and colorful ways is fun.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:07.846 A:middle
That animation is so cool.

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:09.436 A:middle
We've seen how being convenient,

00:02:09.536 --> 00:02:11.096 A:middle
personal and fun are part of

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:12.306 A:middle
what makes Stickers such a great

00:02:12.306 --> 00:02:13.046 A:middle
experience.

00:02:13.846 --> 00:02:15.776 A:middle
But what works for Stickers can

00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:16.926 A:middle
also work for other apps.

00:02:18.386 --> 00:02:19.926 A:middle
Like expressive apps, sharing

00:02:19.926 --> 00:02:21.216 A:middle
apps, and collaborative apps.

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:23.946 A:middle
Let's focus on expressive apps.

00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:27.356 A:middle
Here is one that I love.

00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:31.176 A:middle
Tumblr. Tumblr's iOS app is a

00:02:31.176 --> 00:02:32.486 A:middle
social media destination

00:02:32.526 --> 00:02:34.266 A:middle
optimized for sharing photos and

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:35.396 A:middle
gifts, but that doesn't

00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:37.116 A:middle
necessarily translate into

00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:38.646 A:middle
person to person communication.

00:02:38.916 --> 00:02:39.826 A:middle
So they made something

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:40.266 A:middle
different.

00:02:40.496 --> 00:02:41.726 A:middle
They made a GIF generator.

00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:44.426 A:middle
Going to jump into another app

00:02:44.426 --> 00:02:45.576 A:middle
here, and pick a video that I

00:02:45.576 --> 00:02:45.886 A:middle
made.

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:49.436 A:middle
Cool. I can set the playback

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:51.776 A:middle
behavior, and speed it up a

00:02:51.776 --> 00:02:52.836 A:middle
little bit.

00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:55.726 A:middle
My friend is having a bad day,

00:02:55.726 --> 00:02:56.866 A:middle
so I'm going to send him a fun

00:02:56.866 --> 00:02:57.536 A:middle
little message.

00:02:58.336 --> 00:02:59.246 A:middle
Bounce back, Homey!

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:02.996 A:middle
I could pick the color.

00:03:04.806 --> 00:03:06.296 A:middle
And change the font.

00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:09.596 A:middle
Scale and rotate.

00:03:09.936 --> 00:03:11.156 A:middle
Get that frog in there, nice.

00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:12.856 A:middle
And send it.

00:03:16.236 --> 00:03:16.746 A:middle
Cool.

00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:21.076 A:middle
Tumblr made a robust GIF editor

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.746 A:middle
allowing you to trim your video,

00:03:22.746 --> 00:03:24.536 A:middle
control the play speed, and set

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:25.446 A:middle
playback behavior.

00:03:25.566 --> 00:03:27.716 A:middle
It is so powerful, and lives

00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:28.856 A:middle
right within messages.

00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:30.776 A:middle
The whole process is lightweight

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:31.516 A:middle
and convenient.

00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:35.526 A:middle
You can also customize text,

00:03:35.586 --> 00:03:37.496 A:middle
setting the font style, color,

00:03:37.496 --> 00:03:39.066 A:middle
scale and rotation to

00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:40.126 A:middle
personalize your GIF.

00:03:40.396 --> 00:03:42.116 A:middle
All these decisions make your

00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:43.966 A:middle
GIF special for both you and the

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:45.016 A:middle
person you're sending it to.

00:03:49.676 --> 00:03:51.436 A:middle
And it's fun to see the GIF that

00:03:51.436 --> 00:03:53.006 A:middle
you just created looping in your

00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:53.816 A:middle
conversation.

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:54.996 A:middle
I know this is going to get a

00:03:54.996 --> 00:03:55.736 A:middle
good reaction.

00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:59.736 A:middle
We've seen how Tumblr has made a

00:03:59.736 --> 00:04:01.526 A:middle
robust, expressive app that is

00:04:01.526 --> 00:04:03.746 A:middle
so different from Stickers, yet

00:04:03.746 --> 00:04:05.296 A:middle
it maintains the core qualities

00:04:05.296 --> 00:04:08.116 A:middle
of a successful iMessage app.

00:04:08.336 --> 00:04:09.276 A:middle
Let's see how it works for a

00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:09.956 A:middle
sharing app.

00:04:10.236 --> 00:04:12.196 A:middle
Here is an awesome app.

00:04:12.376 --> 00:04:13.186 A:middle
Dunkin Donuts.

00:04:15.676 --> 00:04:17.766 A:middle
Their iOS app is filled with all

00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:18.606 A:middle
kinds of stuff.

00:04:18.606 --> 00:04:20.506 A:middle
You can see your rewards, find

00:04:20.506 --> 00:04:22.926 A:middle
locations, see the menu, order

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:23.356 A:middle
drinks.

00:04:23.766 --> 00:04:24.916 A:middle
But all these features don't

00:04:24.916 --> 00:04:26.756 A:middle
necessarily translate into a

00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:28.206 A:middle
conversational experience.

00:04:28.396 --> 00:04:29.816 A:middle
But one part definitely does.

00:04:30.396 --> 00:04:30.956 A:middle
Gift cards.

00:04:30.956 --> 00:04:33.106 A:middle
Going to go in here.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.586 A:middle
My friend just helped me move,

00:04:34.586 --> 00:04:35.426 A:middle
so I'm going to send him a gift

00:04:35.426 --> 00:04:35.766 A:middle
card.

00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:38.506 A:middle
And he was kind of lazy, so I'm

00:04:38.506 --> 00:04:39.406 A:middle
only going to send him five

00:04:39.406 --> 00:04:39.756 A:middle
bucks.

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:43.456 A:middle
Going to pick the right gift

00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:43.796 A:middle
card.

00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:44.726 A:middle
How about "You're one in a

00:04:44.726 --> 00:04:45.176 A:middle
million"?

00:04:45.176 --> 00:04:46.206 A:middle
That is kind of silly, right?

00:04:47.096 --> 00:04:49.336 A:middle
And use the Apple Pay sheet, and

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:50.506 A:middle
boom, just like that.

00:04:50.506 --> 00:04:53.506 A:middle
I just sent a gift card.

00:04:56.846 --> 00:04:58.556 A:middle
Apple Pay allows you to perform

00:04:58.556 --> 00:04:59.856 A:middle
financial transactions without

00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:00.786 A:middle
leaving messages.

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:02.106 A:middle
It is super convenient.

00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:05.306 A:middle
These cards look really nice.

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:06.846 A:middle
Maybe it's your nephew's

00:05:06.846 --> 00:05:08.376 A:middle
graduation or a friend's

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:09.746 A:middle
birthday, or you want to let

00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:10.456 A:middle
someone know that you're

00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:11.196 A:middle
thinking about them.

00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:12.596 A:middle
Sending a gift card is a great

00:05:12.596 --> 00:05:13.166 A:middle
way to do it.

00:05:13.166 --> 00:05:14.526 A:middle
Everyone loves donuts.

00:05:16.686 --> 00:05:18.636 A:middle
And giving is fun.

00:05:19.026 --> 00:05:20.056 A:middle
Being kind is fun.

00:05:20.276 --> 00:05:21.466 A:middle
The person receiving this is

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:22.576 A:middle
probably going to be really

00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:23.176 A:middle
surprised.

00:05:28.276 --> 00:05:30.146 A:middle
So the Dunkin Donuts app is so

00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:31.386 A:middle
different than Stickers and

00:05:31.386 --> 00:05:33.106 A:middle
Tumblr, it still works well

00:05:33.106 --> 00:05:34.206 A:middle
because it embodies the same

00:05:34.206 --> 00:05:34.936 A:middle
three qualities.

00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:38.136 A:middle
There are also collaborative

00:05:38.136 --> 00:05:39.876 A:middle
apps, like games and polling.

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:42.166 A:middle
Games and polling rely on both

00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:44.106 A:middle
parties to participate, to make

00:05:44.106 --> 00:05:45.506 A:middle
the most of the app experience.

00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:46.796 A:middle
I'm going to share with you one

00:05:46.796 --> 00:05:48.266 A:middle
of my favorite apps.

00:05:49.226 --> 00:05:52.586 A:middle
Tinder. Tinder is a popular

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:53.956 A:middle
dating app, but you're probably

00:05:53.956 --> 00:05:55.386 A:middle
asking yourself how does a

00:05:55.386 --> 00:05:56.556 A:middle
dating app find its way into

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:57.226 A:middle
messages?

00:05:57.336 --> 00:06:00.356 A:middle
One of the core features of

00:06:00.356 --> 00:06:01.496 A:middle
Tinder is Stacks.

00:06:02.076 --> 00:06:03.316 A:middle
A data can upload a set of

00:06:03.316 --> 00:06:05.396 A:middle
images, or create a stack, to

00:06:05.396 --> 00:06:06.716 A:middle
attract potential connections.

00:06:07.246 --> 00:06:09.786 A:middle
I am going to go here and create

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:10.226 A:middle
a stack.

00:06:10.676 --> 00:06:11.766 A:middle
I'm having a little personal

00:06:11.766 --> 00:06:14.096 A:middle
crisis today, so maybe my friend

00:06:14.096 --> 00:06:14.566 A:middle
could help me.

00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:16.236 A:middle
I really need to know what shoes

00:06:16.236 --> 00:06:17.846 A:middle
I should wear today.

00:06:17.846 --> 00:06:19.986 A:middle
Going to pick my images, name my

00:06:19.986 --> 00:06:25.046 A:middle
stack, and vote on my own stack.

00:06:25.046 --> 00:06:26.376 A:middle
I really love all of these, so

00:06:26.376 --> 00:06:27.976 A:middle
hopefully I can get some help.

00:06:29.626 --> 00:06:30.756 A:middle
Then I just sent a poll.

00:06:33.056 --> 00:06:34.456 A:middle
Imagine if you had to create a

00:06:34.456 --> 00:06:36.566 A:middle
poll without using this app.

00:06:36.566 --> 00:06:37.376 A:middle
You would have to send these

00:06:37.376 --> 00:06:38.756 A:middle
images individually.

00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:40.166 A:middle
And how would people vote for

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:40.436 A:middle
them?

00:06:40.806 --> 00:06:42.676 A:middle
They would have to say leather

00:06:42.676 --> 00:06:43.986 A:middle
boots, or yellow sneakers.

00:06:44.116 --> 00:06:45.306 A:middle
But here, they could just cast

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:45.806 A:middle
their vote.

00:06:46.256 --> 00:06:47.806 A:middle
Making polls with Tinder is so

00:06:47.806 --> 00:06:48.286 A:middle
easy.

00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:50.596 A:middle
I have the Tinder app just so I

00:06:50.596 --> 00:06:51.516 A:middle
could use this feature

00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:54.526 A:middle
[laughter].

00:06:55.026 --> 00:06:56.646 A:middle
Taking a poll is personal.

00:06:56.706 --> 00:06:57.956 A:middle
You're sharing a personal set of

00:06:57.956 --> 00:07:01.006 A:middle
images, selfies, sneakers, food,

00:07:01.006 --> 00:07:02.586 A:middle
or whatever, you're asking a

00:07:02.586 --> 00:07:04.166 A:middle
trusted person for their opinion

00:07:04.366 --> 00:07:04.976 A:middle
because you care.

00:07:07.996 --> 00:07:08.516 A:middle
And it's fun.

00:07:08.516 --> 00:07:10.186 A:middle
It's fun to pick people's

00:07:10.186 --> 00:07:10.636 A:middle
brains.

00:07:10.836 --> 00:07:12.836 A:middle
It's fun to agree and disagree.

00:07:13.206 --> 00:07:14.816 A:middle
The poll evolves as people vote,

00:07:14.816 --> 00:07:16.476 A:middle
and becomes an enjoyable event

00:07:16.476 --> 00:07:17.036 A:middle
for everyone.

00:07:18.876 --> 00:07:20.346 A:middle
So whether you're making a

00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:23.036 A:middle
sticker pack, a GIF generator, a

00:07:23.036 --> 00:07:24.726 A:middle
gifting experience, or an image

00:07:24.726 --> 00:07:27.836 A:middle
poll, making them convenient,

00:07:27.836 --> 00:07:29.956 A:middle
personal and fun can make a huge

00:07:29.956 --> 00:07:31.336 A:middle
difference in the success of

00:07:31.336 --> 00:07:31.926 A:middle
your app.

00:07:35.126 --> 00:07:36.166 A:middle
Here are some tips to get

00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:36.666 A:middle
started.

00:07:38.096 --> 00:07:40.426 A:middle
Tumblr, Dunkin Donuts and Tinder

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:41.616 A:middle
do not set out to put their

00:07:41.616 --> 00:07:43.646 A:middle
entire apps into messages, and

00:07:43.646 --> 00:07:44.616 A:middle
thankfully they didn't.

00:07:44.916 --> 00:07:46.396 A:middle
They integrated only features

00:07:46.506 --> 00:07:47.246 A:middle
that were focused on

00:07:47.246 --> 00:07:47.996 A:middle
communication.

00:07:50.206 --> 00:07:52.206 A:middle
Handcrafted messages are fun to

00:07:52.206 --> 00:07:53.146 A:middle
send and receive.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:54.926 A:middle
Find ways to let your users

00:07:54.926 --> 00:07:56.156 A:middle
create and customize the

00:07:56.156 --> 00:07:56.916 A:middle
experience.

00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:58.586 A:middle
You may find that there are ways

00:07:58.586 --> 00:07:59.826 A:middle
to use your app that you never

00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:00.596 A:middle
even imagined.

00:08:01.116 --> 00:08:02.826 A:middle
You may discover new user bases,

00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:04.366 A:middle
like my experience with Tinder.

00:08:07.646 --> 00:08:09.096 A:middle
There are so many platform

00:08:09.096 --> 00:08:10.966 A:middle
tools, peel and place stickers,

00:08:10.966 --> 00:08:12.866 A:middle
Apple Pay sheet, access to the

00:08:12.866 --> 00:08:14.656 A:middle
microphone, camera and photos.

00:08:14.986 --> 00:08:16.066 A:middle
Think about what is best for

00:08:16.066 --> 00:08:17.626 A:middle
your app, and improve on an

00:08:17.626 --> 00:08:19.336 A:middle
existing experience, or create a

00:08:19.336 --> 00:08:19.796 A:middle
new one.

00:08:21.386 --> 00:08:23.276 A:middle
Because in the end, you want to

00:08:23.276 --> 00:08:24.866 A:middle
create a wonderful experience

00:08:25.026 --> 00:08:26.376 A:middle
for your family and friends.

00:08:27.676 --> 00:08:28.356 A:middle
Thank you.

00:08:29.016 --> 00:08:30.000 A:middle
