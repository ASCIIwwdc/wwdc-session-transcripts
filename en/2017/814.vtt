[ Applause and cheers ]

00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:21.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; In this session we're going

00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:23.756 A:middle
to discuss the best practices of

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:24.756 A:middle
subscriptions.

00:00:25.086 --> 00:00:26.776 A:middle
We'll focus on effectively

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:29.116 A:middle
communicating the value of your

00:00:29.116 --> 00:00:30.866 A:middle
subscriptions, streamlining the

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.046 A:middle
signup flow, and providing

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:34.856 A:middle
positive and effortless

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.756 A:middle
subscription experiences.

00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:38.986 A:middle
Lauren, back to you.

00:00:39.586 --> 00:00:39.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:41.276 A:middle
Thanks, Doug.

00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:42.976 A:middle
We're going to try this again.

00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:45.331 A:middle
[ Laugh ]

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.296 A:middle
Subscriptions are the fastest

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:48.476 A:middle
growing business model in the

00:00:48.476 --> 00:00:49.026 A:middle
App Store.

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:50.966 A:middle
Why is it almost every time

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.446 A:middle
you're ready to sign up for an

00:00:53.446 --> 00:00:55.326 A:middle
awesome new service or to

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:57.036 A:middle
subscribe to some amazing new

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:59.526 A:middle
content, this is the feeling

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.086 A:middle
that you get?

00:01:00.816 --> 00:01:02.336 A:middle
That's because it's all too

00:01:02.336 --> 00:01:04.396 A:middle
common for subscriptions to feel

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:07.756 A:middle
complicated, confusing, or just

00:01:07.756 --> 00:01:09.986 A:middle
take too long to sign up.

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:12.026 A:middle
So, for a great user experience,

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:13.466 A:middle
make your subscription

00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:16.046 A:middle
effortless, transparent, and

00:01:16.046 --> 00:01:16.606 A:middle
engaging.

00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:18.526 A:middle
Let's focus on each of these

00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:19.996 A:middle
principles to improve the user

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:21.476 A:middle
experience and design for

00:01:21.476 --> 00:01:22.426 A:middle
subscription success.

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:26.416 A:middle
The first step we'll talk about,

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:27.916 A:middle
being effortless.

00:01:28.576 --> 00:01:29.846 A:middle
So what does it mean for your

00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:31.156 A:middle
subscription to be effortless?

00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:33.146 A:middle
It means that people should know

00:01:33.146 --> 00:01:34.556 A:middle
that you have a subscription.

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:36.936 A:middle
That way they shouldn't have to

00:01:36.936 --> 00:01:39.606 A:middle
look for how to sign up.

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:41.766 A:middle
So it's important to be visible.

00:01:42.186 --> 00:01:43.956 A:middle
Get out there and don't be shy.

00:01:44.486 --> 00:01:45.806 A:middle
Let people know that you have a

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:47.626 A:middle
subscription offer, and ask them

00:01:47.626 --> 00:01:48.916 A:middle
to sign up.

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:50.896 A:middle
One approach would be to persist

00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:52.516 A:middle
a Subscribe button in your app's

00:01:52.516 --> 00:01:53.086 A:middle
interface.

00:01:53.956 --> 00:01:55.476 A:middle
Here in "The New York Times"

00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:57.566 A:middle
they do a great job persisting a

00:01:57.606 --> 00:01:58.476 A:middle
Subscribe button.

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:00.446 A:middle
And they do this tastefully

00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:01.476 A:middle
throughout the entire UI.

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:03.456 A:middle
It's very visible.

00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:05.216 A:middle
And it's across each article.

00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:07.576 A:middle
This is done really well.

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:10.106 A:middle
And it's not annoying or pushy,

00:02:10.506 --> 00:02:12.016 A:middle
because it families together

00:02:12.016 --> 00:02:12.926 A:middle
with their interface.

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:16.016 A:middle
Don't present your subscription

00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:17.446 A:middle
like a popup add or a

00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:18.306 A:middle
notification.

00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:20.976 A:middle
Because popups and notifications

00:02:20.976 --> 00:02:22.626 A:middle
are intended to be dismissed.

00:02:22.886 --> 00:02:24.216 A:middle
And you don't want people to

00:02:24.216 --> 00:02:25.716 A:middle
dismiss your subscription offer.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:27.986 A:middle
Another way to present your

00:02:27.986 --> 00:02:29.686 A:middle
subscription would be to be

00:02:29.686 --> 00:02:31.336 A:middle
visible and present it when

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:32.996 A:middle
someone has expressed interest

00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:35.206 A:middle
in a piece of content or in a

00:02:35.206 --> 00:02:36.616 A:middle
feature that you offer through a

00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:37.746 A:middle
subscription.

00:02:39.116 --> 00:02:40.846 A:middle
This is the dating app Her.

00:02:41.476 --> 00:02:43.006 A:middle
So let's just say you're swiping

00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:45.226 A:middle
through a few profiles and you

00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:46.496 A:middle
accidentally pass on somebody

00:02:46.496 --> 00:02:46.986 A:middle
who's cute.

00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:48.876 A:middle
So you attempt to rewind that

00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:51.056 A:middle
profile, and in that moment, the

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:53.226 A:middle
app Her tastefully presents an

00:02:53.226 --> 00:02:54.536 A:middle
option for you to subscribe.

00:02:55.026 --> 00:02:56.686 A:middle
Because the rewind feature is

00:02:56.686 --> 00:02:57.616 A:middle
what they offer as a

00:02:57.616 --> 00:02:58.356 A:middle
subscription.

00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:00.406 A:middle
And this is great.

00:03:00.406 --> 00:03:01.806 A:middle
It's an appropriate time for Her

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.126 A:middle
to present you with this offer

00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:04.526 A:middle
because you've shown interest.

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:06.796 A:middle
Her does a wonderful job

00:03:06.796 --> 00:03:07.976 A:middle
presenting the values of your

00:03:07.976 --> 00:03:09.876 A:middle
subscription right here as well

00:03:09.876 --> 00:03:11.806 A:middle
with this beautiful, light

00:03:11.806 --> 00:03:12.436 A:middle
animation.

00:03:13.856 --> 00:03:16.476 A:middle
So whether you choose to make it

00:03:16.476 --> 00:03:17.696 A:middle
persistent in your user

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:20.866 A:middle
interface, or present the option

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.666 A:middle
to subscribe when someone has

00:03:22.666 --> 00:03:25.186 A:middle
expressed interest, make sure

00:03:25.186 --> 00:03:26.876 A:middle
that it is visible to people so

00:03:26.876 --> 00:03:27.636 A:middle
they know you have a

00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:28.716 A:middle
subscription.

00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:31.236 A:middle
And no matter what you choose,

00:03:31.696 --> 00:03:33.286 A:middle
all subscription apps should

00:03:33.286 --> 00:03:35.136 A:middle
include a place to sign up in

00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:37.226 A:middle
Settings or Accounts, because

00:03:37.226 --> 00:03:39.046 A:middle
it's a very intuitive place for

00:03:39.046 --> 00:03:40.246 A:middle
place for people to look to sign

00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:40.483 A:middle
up.

00:03:42.476 --> 00:03:42.976 A:middle
All right.

00:03:43.596 --> 00:03:45.166 A:middle
Also, to make your subscription

00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:47.136 A:middle
effortless, you need to remove

00:03:47.136 --> 00:03:47.886 A:middle
friction.

00:03:48.716 --> 00:03:50.686 A:middle
Friction is asking for too much

00:03:50.686 --> 00:03:52.916 A:middle
information, having too many

00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:55.116 A:middle
steps, and taking too much time

00:03:55.116 --> 00:03:56.096 A:middle
for somebody to sign up.

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.096 A:middle
But how do you know when you've

00:03:58.096 --> 00:03:59.176 A:middle
asked for too much?

00:04:00.316 --> 00:04:01.316 A:middle
This data should help.

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:03.986 A:middle
This graph represents a snapshot

00:04:03.986 --> 00:04:05.796 A:middle
of one month of data from the

00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:08.006 A:middle
three top video streaming apps

00:04:08.196 --> 00:04:09.266 A:middle
in the US.

00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:10.896 A:middle
Now, while their names have been

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:13.086 A:middle
removed, all the important data

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.446 A:middle
here is the clicks to conversion

00:04:14.446 --> 00:04:15.046 A:middle
ratio.

00:04:15.796 --> 00:04:18.756 A:middle
A subscription flow that has

00:04:18.756 --> 00:04:21.456 A:middle
three clicks led to a 61%

00:04:21.456 --> 00:04:22.216 A:middle
conversion rate.

00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:24.056 A:middle
And a subscription flow with

00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:26.576 A:middle
four clicks led to a 48%

00:04:26.576 --> 00:04:27.276 A:middle
conversion rate.

00:04:27.786 --> 00:04:29.436 A:middle
However, as soon as there was

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:30.706 A:middle
nine clicks, it dropped

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:32.846 A:middle
significantly down to 7%.

00:04:33.696 --> 00:04:34.696 A:middle
Now, while this is just a

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:36.576 A:middle
sample, it's clear that you

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:37.916 A:middle
should only ask for what is

00:04:38.096 --> 00:04:39.766 A:middle
absolutely necessary for someone

00:04:39.766 --> 00:04:40.386 A:middle
to sign up.

00:04:40.876 --> 00:04:43.596 A:middle
Because quite literally, less is

00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:43.986 A:middle
more.

00:04:44.626 --> 00:04:47.356 A:middle
Less clicks, less friction, will

00:04:47.356 --> 00:04:49.336 A:middle
lead to more conversion and more

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:50.066 A:middle
subscribers.

00:04:51.016 --> 00:04:52.736 A:middle
So focus on people on just

00:04:52.766 --> 00:04:53.786 A:middle
signing up first.

00:04:54.306 --> 00:04:55.846 A:middle
Things like favoriting,

00:04:55.846 --> 00:04:57.876 A:middle
personalization, and asking for

00:04:57.876 --> 00:04:59.256 A:middle
additional personal details can

00:04:59.256 --> 00:05:01.076 A:middle
all wait until after someone has

00:05:01.076 --> 00:05:02.166 A:middle
signed up.

00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:04.756 A:middle
So, by being visible, and

00:05:04.756 --> 00:05:06.986 A:middle
removing friction, your app

00:05:06.986 --> 00:05:08.356 A:middle
subscription will be effortless

00:05:08.356 --> 00:05:09.726 A:middle
and easier for people to

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:10.246 A:middle
subscribe.

00:05:12.176 --> 00:05:14.146 A:middle
Next, let's talk about being

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:15.136 A:middle
transparent with your

00:05:15.136 --> 00:05:16.006 A:middle
subscription.

00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:18.576 A:middle
Because transparency is the best

00:05:18.576 --> 00:05:19.146 A:middle
policy.

00:05:20.016 --> 00:05:21.356 A:middle
And you need to provide clear

00:05:21.356 --> 00:05:23.856 A:middle
terms so people understand what

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:24.906 A:middle
they're signing up for.

00:05:26.196 --> 00:05:27.696 A:middle
Strive to be glance-able.

00:05:28.246 --> 00:05:30.086 A:middle
All in one view and in just a

00:05:30.086 --> 00:05:31.756 A:middle
few seconds, people should be

00:05:31.756 --> 00:05:33.566 A:middle
able to clearly understand what

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:35.316 A:middle
your subscription offer is and

00:05:35.366 --> 00:05:37.106 A:middle
how to sign up.

00:05:37.106 --> 00:05:37.966 A:middle
So when you're making your

00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:40.876 A:middle
subscription, always include: a

00:05:40.876 --> 00:05:43.566 A:middle
concise value proposition, a

00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:46.696 A:middle
strong call to action, a place

00:05:46.776 --> 00:05:48.426 A:middle
for people to log in if they are

00:05:48.426 --> 00:05:49.636 A:middle
existing subscribers.

00:05:50.836 --> 00:05:52.636 A:middle
Also the ability to restore if

00:05:52.636 --> 00:05:53.676 A:middle
someone has a new device.

00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:56.666 A:middle
And a place to sign up that

00:05:56.666 --> 00:05:58.716 A:middle
includes clear pricing and

00:05:58.716 --> 00:05:59.216 A:middle
terms.

00:05:59.896 --> 00:06:01.906 A:middle
And always offer multiple tiers.

00:06:02.276 --> 00:06:03.456 A:middle
Because you don't know if

00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:04.886 A:middle
somebody wants to sign up for a

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:07.626 A:middle
day, a week, a month, or two

00:06:07.626 --> 00:06:08.076 A:middle
years.

00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:10.596 A:middle
So try offering three or four

00:06:10.596 --> 00:06:12.656 A:middle
different tiers to find out what

00:06:12.656 --> 00:06:14.356 A:middle
works best for your audience.

00:06:15.376 --> 00:06:17.986 A:middle
The MLB At Bat app does a great

00:06:17.986 --> 00:06:20.006 A:middle
job and offers all of this in

00:06:20.006 --> 00:06:21.686 A:middle
one easy-to-understand

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:22.886 A:middle
glance-able view.

00:06:23.366 --> 00:06:25.466 A:middle
And this is important because

00:06:25.466 --> 00:06:27.216 A:middle
most of us are signing up on our

00:06:27.216 --> 00:06:27.666 A:middle
phones.

00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:29.526 A:middle
So please, keep it simple.

00:06:31.176 --> 00:06:33.326 A:middle
By providing clear terms, people

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:34.686 A:middle
will be able to make an informed

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:36.446 A:middle
decision on how to subscribe.

00:06:37.626 --> 00:06:37.926 A:middle
All right.

00:06:38.616 --> 00:06:40.046 A:middle
I saved the best for last.

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:43.316 A:middle
Your app needs to be engaging

00:06:43.506 --> 00:06:45.786 A:middle
from the start, before people

00:06:45.786 --> 00:06:46.396 A:middle
subscribe.

00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:48.446 A:middle
And the best way to engage them

00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:49.886 A:middle
is through experience.

00:06:50.916 --> 00:06:52.776 A:middle
Let them experience your app and

00:06:52.776 --> 00:06:54.616 A:middle
your app's content before having

00:06:54.616 --> 00:06:55.456 A:middle
them subscribe.

00:06:56.046 --> 00:06:57.786 A:middle
Because being able to experience

00:06:57.786 --> 00:06:59.656 A:middle
and try before you buy is a part

00:06:59.656 --> 00:07:00.686 A:middle
of how we make purchase

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:01.346 A:middle
decisions today.

00:07:02.596 --> 00:07:04.896 A:middle
From trying on clothes to

00:07:04.896 --> 00:07:07.696 A:middle
attending an open house, or even

00:07:07.696 --> 00:07:09.046 A:middle
test driving a car before you

00:07:09.046 --> 00:07:10.156 A:middle
buy or lease it.

00:07:11.436 --> 00:07:13.026 A:middle
All of these are experiences

00:07:13.026 --> 00:07:14.456 A:middle
that you can do that help you

00:07:14.456 --> 00:07:15.716 A:middle
make a decision before you

00:07:15.716 --> 00:07:16.086 A:middle
purchase.

00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:18.936 A:middle
And the same applies for your

00:07:18.936 --> 00:07:19.046 A:middle
app.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:21.756 A:middle
There are three ways to engage

00:07:21.756 --> 00:07:22.886 A:middle
people through experience.

00:07:22.996 --> 00:07:24.506 A:middle
And it'll make it much easier

00:07:24.506 --> 00:07:25.536 A:middle
for them to subscribe.

00:07:26.906 --> 00:07:28.516 A:middle
First, you can offer a free

00:07:28.516 --> 00:07:29.026 A:middle
trial.

00:07:29.536 --> 00:07:31.016 A:middle
That way, people can try out the

00:07:31.016 --> 00:07:32.996 A:middle
entire app for free for a

00:07:32.996 --> 00:07:33.756 A:middle
limited time.

00:07:34.976 --> 00:07:37.006 A:middle
This works well for established

00:07:37.006 --> 00:07:38.386 A:middle
brands and when people have an

00:07:38.386 --> 00:07:40.156 A:middle
idea of what's included with the

00:07:40.156 --> 00:07:40.896 A:middle
subscription.

00:07:41.726 --> 00:07:43.276 A:middle
So, if you have an established

00:07:43.276 --> 00:07:45.206 A:middle
brand, a free trial is a great

00:07:45.206 --> 00:07:46.766 A:middle
way to let people engage with

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:49.186 A:middle
your app and its contents before

00:07:49.186 --> 00:07:49.856 A:middle
they subscribe.

00:07:50.496 --> 00:07:53.106 A:middle
You can also make the majority

00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:54.886 A:middle
of your app available for free

00:07:54.936 --> 00:07:57.026 A:middle
and offer a premium feature as a

00:07:57.026 --> 00:07:57.766 A:middle
subscription.

00:07:58.516 --> 00:08:00.056 A:middle
For example, in the app Sleep

00:08:00.056 --> 00:08:02.096 A:middle
Cycle, you can use the entire

00:08:02.096 --> 00:08:04.436 A:middle
app for free, except the trends

00:08:04.436 --> 00:08:07.026 A:middle
feature shown here is what is

00:08:07.026 --> 00:08:09.016 A:middle
available to people who have

00:08:09.016 --> 00:08:09.606 A:middle
subscribed.

00:08:10.816 --> 00:08:12.416 A:middle
And Sleep Cycle makes it really

00:08:12.416 --> 00:08:13.856 A:middle
easy for people to sign up right

00:08:13.856 --> 00:08:14.316 A:middle
from here.

00:08:14.896 --> 00:08:16.546 A:middle
It's a great technique to offer

00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:18.296 A:middle
a peek of content behind this

00:08:18.366 --> 00:08:18.766 A:middle
blur.

00:08:19.206 --> 00:08:21.466 A:middle
That way potential subscribers

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:23.086 A:middle
can see what kind of content

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.806 A:middle
they would have access to if

00:08:24.806 --> 00:08:25.916 A:middle
they did subscribe.

00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:29.726 A:middle
And finally, you can allow

00:08:29.726 --> 00:08:31.086 A:middle
people to sample content.

00:08:31.646 --> 00:08:32.936 A:middle
It's a great way to engage

00:08:32.936 --> 00:08:33.746 A:middle
through experience.

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:35.076 A:middle
And it works great for the

00:08:35.076 --> 00:08:36.226 A:middle
majority of apps.

00:08:37.626 --> 00:08:39.136 A:middle
This is "The New York Times."

00:08:39.216 --> 00:08:40.486 A:middle
And you're able to read ten

00:08:40.526 --> 00:08:42.736 A:middle
articles for free per month.

00:08:43.346 --> 00:08:44.856 A:middle
And this is a wonderful sampling

00:08:44.856 --> 00:08:46.716 A:middle
experience because "The New York

00:08:46.716 --> 00:08:48.776 A:middle
Times" lets people have control

00:08:48.776 --> 00:08:50.386 A:middle
over what content they're able

00:08:50.386 --> 00:08:51.026 A:middle
to sample.

00:08:51.816 --> 00:08:53.306 A:middle
That allows people to find the

00:08:53.306 --> 00:08:54.476 A:middle
content that they're interested

00:08:54.476 --> 00:08:55.976 A:middle
in and helps them better

00:08:55.976 --> 00:08:57.466 A:middle
understand the value of the

00:08:57.466 --> 00:08:58.196 A:middle
subscription.

00:08:59.496 --> 00:09:01.276 A:middle
The objective is to let people

00:09:01.276 --> 00:09:03.186 A:middle
experience and become familiar

00:09:03.186 --> 00:09:04.836 A:middle
with your app and its content.

00:09:05.246 --> 00:09:06.806 A:middle
And that will make it easier for

00:09:06.806 --> 00:09:07.626 A:middle
them to subscribe.

00:09:08.616 --> 00:09:10.216 A:middle
And no matter which option you

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.236 A:middle
choose, make sure that it works

00:09:12.236 --> 00:09:13.476 A:middle
for your audience.

00:09:13.976 --> 00:09:15.316 A:middle
And you know them best.

00:09:15.926 --> 00:09:17.166 A:middle
Think about their current user

00:09:17.166 --> 00:09:19.156 A:middle
experience, the type of content

00:09:19.156 --> 00:09:20.566 A:middle
they have currently available in

00:09:20.566 --> 00:09:22.366 A:middle
your app, and how adding

00:09:22.366 --> 00:09:23.716 A:middle
subscriptions could impact that

00:09:23.716 --> 00:09:24.366 A:middle
experience.

00:09:25.936 --> 00:09:27.326 A:middle
So design your subscription to

00:09:27.326 --> 00:09:29.306 A:middle
be effortless by being visible

00:09:29.676 --> 00:09:30.826 A:middle
and reducing friction.

00:09:31.376 --> 00:09:32.876 A:middle
By being transparent with your

00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:35.206 A:middle
terms and pricing, and engaging

00:09:35.206 --> 00:09:37.186 A:middle
people through experiencing your

00:09:37.426 --> 00:09:38.926 A:middle
app and its rich contents.

00:09:39.366 --> 00:09:41.746 A:middle
That way it'll be really easy

00:09:41.746 --> 00:09:43.526 A:middle
for people to sign up.

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:43.956 A:middle
Thank you.
