00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:27.051 A:middle
[ Bell Ring ]

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:27.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You guys know that sound,

00:00:27.806 --> 00:00:27.896 A:middle
right?

00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:29.826 A:middle
You know, you've probably seen

00:00:29.826 --> 00:00:30.676 A:middle
that badge before.

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:32.486 A:middle
I know we're all familiar with

00:00:32.516 --> 00:00:33.336 A:middle
notifications.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.226 A:middle
And often they're really, really

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:35.906 A:middle
great.

00:00:35.906 --> 00:00:36.596 A:middle
You know, there's lots of

00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:37.806 A:middle
reasons to be excited when you

00:00:37.806 --> 00:00:38.606 A:middle
hear that sound.

00:00:38.986 --> 00:00:40.206 A:middle
Maybe it's an iMessage you're

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.626 A:middle
eagerly awaiting, your favorite

00:00:41.626 --> 00:00:43.586 A:middle
app has something to share,

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:44.376 A:middle
maybe you've got something on

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:45.526 A:middle
social media that is just

00:00:45.726 --> 00:00:46.746 A:middle
totally blowing up.

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.186 A:middle
Like, notifications, they're

00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:49.646 A:middle
really fun and they're a big

00:00:49.646 --> 00:00:51.326 A:middle
reason we love our iPhones so

00:00:51.326 --> 00:00:51.656 A:middle
much.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:56.186 A:middle
But I think as we all know maybe

00:00:56.186 --> 00:00:58.036 A:middle
too much of a good thing is not

00:00:58.036 --> 00:00:59.276 A:middle
always such a good thing, right?

00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:00.416 A:middle
And I would imagine there's a

00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:01.816 A:middle
few of you that have some apps

00:01:01.816 --> 00:01:02.826 A:middle
that look like this, right?

00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:04.456 A:middle
So let's talk about what we can

00:01:04.456 --> 00:01:05.196 A:middle
do to make sure all these

00:01:05.196 --> 00:01:06.656 A:middle
notifications are something

00:01:06.656 --> 00:01:07.136 A:middle
really great?

00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:10.686 A:middle
So first off, let's be mindful

00:01:10.686 --> 00:01:11.496 A:middle
of people's time.

00:01:11.846 --> 00:01:12.376 A:middle
You know, we should send

00:01:12.376 --> 00:01:13.606 A:middle
notifications only when they're

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:14.126 A:middle
relevant.

00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:15.286 A:middle
Don't spam.

00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:17.486 A:middle
Don't send them to boost traffic

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.286 A:middle
or engagement, but only when

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:20.326 A:middle
your app has some important

00:01:20.326 --> 00:01:21.266 A:middle
information to share.

00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:23.136 A:middle
When asking for permission to

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:24.526 A:middle
send them, you know, be clear

00:01:24.526 --> 00:01:24.886 A:middle
why.

00:01:25.016 --> 00:01:26.276 A:middle
Explain what notifications are

00:01:26.276 --> 00:01:28.196 A:middle
going to be about, and the value

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:29.066 A:middle
that they will provide.

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:30.406 A:middle
You know, because there is a

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:31.816 A:middle
real consequence if you send too

00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:33.696 A:middle
many and they're not informative

00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:34.296 A:middle
or useful.

00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:35.266 A:middle
You know, people can shut them

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.816 A:middle
off, or maybe even delete your

00:01:36.816 --> 00:01:37.086 A:middle
app.

00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:38.276 A:middle
And nobody wants that.

00:01:39.086 --> 00:01:40.136 A:middle
I'd like to stress this point

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:40.296 A:middle
here.

00:01:40.636 --> 00:01:42.206 A:middle
Don't think of notifications as

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:43.266 A:middle
just a hook into your app.

00:01:43.986 --> 00:01:44.906 A:middle
You know, they should be a

00:01:44.946 --> 00:01:46.516 A:middle
self-contained package of

00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:48.126 A:middle
information that allows you to

00:01:48.126 --> 00:01:49.366 A:middle
complete a specific task.

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:51.056 A:middle
Because if someone does interact

00:01:51.056 --> 00:01:52.076 A:middle
with your notification, we want

00:01:52.076 --> 00:01:53.046 A:middle
to make sure it is worthwhile to

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:53.246 A:middle
them.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.366 A:middle
Because if you create delightful

00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:56.736 A:middle
and useful notifications, there

00:01:57.076 --> 00:01:58.676 A:middle
is a real opportunity to create

00:01:58.746 --> 00:02:00.486 A:middle
a bond between people and your

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:01.846 A:middle
app, and that is going to create

00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:03.346 A:middle
a real value for you as

00:02:03.346 --> 00:02:05.206 A:middle
developers, and real value for

00:02:05.206 --> 00:02:06.666 A:middle
everyone that uses your app.

00:02:08.806 --> 00:02:09.496 A:middle
So, to make sure we're on the

00:02:09.556 --> 00:02:11.146 A:middle
same page here, let's talk about

00:02:11.146 --> 00:02:12.786 A:middle
what makes a rich notification.

00:02:13.436 --> 00:02:15.906 A:middle
Starting with a Short Look, this

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:17.486 A:middle
should answer the question: What

00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:18.686 A:middle
is this notification about?

00:02:19.676 --> 00:02:20.706 A:middle
So when you're creating these,

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:21.736 A:middle
make sure you're following the

00:02:21.736 --> 00:02:22.226 A:middle
current APIs.

00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:23.666 A:middle
You know, we just had some

00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:25.276 A:middle
updates in iOS 11, take

00:02:25.276 --> 00:02:26.076 A:middle
advantage of those.

00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:27.266 A:middle
We want to make sure you

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:29.046 A:middle
populate all the proper fields

00:02:29.046 --> 00:02:29.746 A:middle
and labels.

00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:31.256 A:middle
And take a minute to make sure

00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:32.396 A:middle
the language that you're using

00:02:32.396 --> 00:02:34.476 A:middle
here is clear, informative and

00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:34.796 A:middle
direct.

00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:38.076 A:middle
So now if you use 3D Touch and

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:39.326 A:middle
you press on the notification,

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:41.786 A:middle
you get what we like to call the

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:42.296 A:middle
Long Look.

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:43.846 A:middle
And here is where you should

00:02:43.846 --> 00:02:45.486 A:middle
provide some additional context,

00:02:45.906 --> 00:02:47.286 A:middle
some additional information

00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:48.366 A:middle
around your notification.

00:02:49.456 --> 00:02:50.286 A:middle
So here, you can see in the

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:52.006 A:middle
calendar notification I get more

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:54.186 A:middle
details about the event, and I

00:02:54.186 --> 00:02:55.746 A:middle
get to see a detail of my day,

00:02:56.186 --> 00:02:57.406 A:middle
and that's the extra content

00:02:57.406 --> 00:02:59.136 A:middle
that makes this really valuable.

00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:00.686 A:middle
It's nice to know more about the

00:03:00.686 --> 00:03:01.996 A:middle
event, but it is really helpful

00:03:01.996 --> 00:03:03.056 A:middle
in this case to know if I'm

00:03:03.156 --> 00:03:04.956 A:middle
free, because at the bottom of

00:03:04.956 --> 00:03:06.346 A:middle
the notification there can be

00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:07.616 A:middle
some optional Quick Actions.

00:03:07.746 --> 00:03:08.906 A:middle
So if it relates to the

00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:10.666 A:middle
notification, add some relevant

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:11.076 A:middle
buttons.

00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:12.576 A:middle
Remember, we want people to see

00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:14.146 A:middle
the alert, get the information

00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:15.626 A:middle
they need, do what they need to

00:03:15.626 --> 00:03:16.986 A:middle
do, and then get back to what

00:03:16.986 --> 00:03:17.806 A:middle
they were just doing.

00:03:18.246 --> 00:03:19.046 A:middle
So now that I know that I'm

00:03:19.046 --> 00:03:20.646 A:middle
free, I can go on and I can

00:03:20.646 --> 00:03:21.566 A:middle
accept the invitation.

00:03:21.926 --> 00:03:22.826 A:middle
I never had to launch the

00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:24.456 A:middle
calendar app, and I never lost

00:03:24.456 --> 00:03:25.736 A:middle
context of what I was doing.

00:03:27.926 --> 00:03:29.166 A:middle
So in creating a notification,

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:30.296 A:middle
remember, the Short Look should

00:03:30.296 --> 00:03:31.496 A:middle
describe what the notification

00:03:31.496 --> 00:03:32.186 A:middle
is about.

00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:33.786 A:middle
The Long Look should provide

00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:34.956 A:middle
some contextually relevant

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:36.496 A:middle
information, and the Quick

00:03:36.496 --> 00:03:37.906 A:middle
Actions should provide some

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:39.126 A:middle
quick actions.

00:03:41.236 --> 00:03:42.556 A:middle
So let's get into some examples

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:43.506 A:middle
now of what great, rich

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:45.316 A:middle
notifications look like, and all

00:03:45.316 --> 00:03:46.296 A:middle
the different things you can do.

00:03:47.776 --> 00:03:49.396 A:middle
So here is a notification for

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:49.596 A:middle
mail.

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:50.516 A:middle
And you can see you are

00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:51.326 A:middle
presented with the sender's

00:03:51.326 --> 00:03:52.816 A:middle
name, the subject of the

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:54.126 A:middle
message, and a few lines of

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:54.736 A:middle
preview.

00:03:55.896 --> 00:03:57.626 A:middle
Now, when I expand this open, I

00:03:57.626 --> 00:03:58.576 A:middle
get to see the rest of the

00:03:58.576 --> 00:03:59.096 A:middle
message.

00:03:59.526 --> 00:04:01.086 A:middle
So at a minimum, this is what we

00:04:01.086 --> 00:04:01.696 A:middle
want to be doing.

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:03.146 A:middle
And if you've got some content

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:04.526 A:middle
that gets truncated in the Short

00:04:04.526 --> 00:04:06.266 A:middle
Look, let's show the rest of it

00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:07.006 A:middle
in the Long Look.

00:04:09.736 --> 00:04:10.656 A:middle
The next thing we can do to make

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:12.296 A:middle
notifications more useful is by

00:04:12.296 --> 00:04:12.996 A:middle
adding an image.

00:04:13.356 --> 00:04:14.676 A:middle
So here is Photos, sending a

00:04:14.676 --> 00:04:15.386 A:middle
notification.

00:04:15.916 --> 00:04:16.936 A:middle
You can see the stream it was

00:04:16.936 --> 00:04:17.806 A:middle
posted to.

00:04:17.806 --> 00:04:19.486 A:middle
You could see who posted it, and

00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:20.446 A:middle
there is a thumbnail on the

00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:21.246 A:middle
right-hand side there.

00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:22.446 A:middle
Those are all helpful bits of

00:04:22.446 --> 00:04:23.036 A:middle
information.

00:04:24.486 --> 00:04:25.446 A:middle
Now, in this Long Look, I can

00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:26.816 A:middle
just see a big version of the

00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:28.106 A:middle
photo and some relevant quick

00:04:28.106 --> 00:04:28.496 A:middle
actions.

00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:30.006 A:middle
So remember here, when you're

00:04:30.006 --> 00:04:31.666 A:middle
adding an image, it doesn't need

00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:32.826 A:middle
to be just a photograph.

00:04:33.236 --> 00:04:34.146 A:middle
This is where you can use some

00:04:34.146 --> 00:04:34.776 A:middle
of your app UI.

00:04:35.376 --> 00:04:37.086 A:middle
So if you have custom UI, custom

00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:39.346 A:middle
typography, elements that make

00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:40.776 A:middle
your app unique, you should add

00:04:40.776 --> 00:04:41.396 A:middle
them here.

00:04:41.396 --> 00:04:42.396 A:middle
You know, just like our calendar

00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:43.386 A:middle
example from before.

00:04:44.206 --> 00:04:45.526 A:middle
Or if you have a data-heavy app,

00:04:45.816 --> 00:04:47.056 A:middle
maybe you have charts and

00:04:47.056 --> 00:04:49.136 A:middle
graphs, flow diagrams, things

00:04:49.136 --> 00:04:50.536 A:middle
like that, you can add those.

00:04:50.536 --> 00:04:51.916 A:middle
If you have a weather app, maybe

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.316 A:middle
you should show the conditions

00:04:53.456 --> 00:04:55.736 A:middle
graphically, present stock

00:04:55.736 --> 00:04:57.136 A:middle
charts if that's your app.

00:04:57.306 --> 00:04:58.936 A:middle
You know, show information as

00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:01.526 A:middle
it's designed in your app.

00:05:02.416 --> 00:05:04.376 A:middle
Here you can see when Tips

00:05:04.376 --> 00:05:05.916 A:middle
presents a notification, they

00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:07.076 A:middle
tell you what it is, right in

00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:07.616 A:middle
the Short Look.

00:05:09.666 --> 00:05:11.026 A:middle
Now, when you expand it, this

00:05:11.026 --> 00:05:12.216 A:middle
notification really comes to

00:05:12.216 --> 00:05:14.116 A:middle
life with video content and

00:05:14.116 --> 00:05:15.446 A:middle
plays a movie, and it shows you

00:05:15.446 --> 00:05:15.726 A:middle
the tip.

00:05:16.296 --> 00:05:17.366 A:middle
It's an example where I don't

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:18.756 A:middle
need to go into the app to learn

00:05:18.756 --> 00:05:19.636 A:middle
what the tip is about.

00:05:19.636 --> 00:05:21.746 A:middle
I get all the information I need

00:05:22.126 --> 00:05:23.836 A:middle
right in the video in line with

00:05:23.866 --> 00:05:24.406 A:middle
the Long Look.

00:05:25.106 --> 00:05:26.136 A:middle
So I think a nice example here

00:05:26.136 --> 00:05:26.946 A:middle
might be for games.

00:05:26.946 --> 00:05:28.476 A:middle
You know I think if you're

00:05:28.476 --> 00:05:29.776 A:middle
playing chess or some other

00:05:29.776 --> 00:05:31.256 A:middle
turn-by-turn game like that, you

00:05:31.256 --> 00:05:32.326 A:middle
know, when someone makes a move,

00:05:32.326 --> 00:05:33.526 A:middle
you can show their last turn

00:05:33.526 --> 00:05:34.366 A:middle
back to them right in the

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:35.006 A:middle
notification.

00:05:35.886 --> 00:05:37.646 A:middle
Now remember, these examples are

00:05:37.646 --> 00:05:39.056 A:middle
bringing notifications to life

00:05:39.116 --> 00:05:40.076 A:middle
with UI animations.

00:05:40.346 --> 00:05:41.286 A:middle
And if those are a big part of

00:05:41.286 --> 00:05:42.526 A:middle
your app, use those in the

00:05:42.526 --> 00:05:43.206 A:middle
notifications.

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:44.076 A:middle
But you can also have

00:05:44.126 --> 00:05:45.716 A:middle
traditional video content here

00:05:45.716 --> 00:05:46.226 A:middle
as well.

00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:47.736 A:middle
So if you have news clips,

00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:49.606 A:middle
sports highlights, things like

00:05:49.606 --> 00:05:51.216 A:middle
that, if video is a part of your

00:05:51.216 --> 00:05:52.386 A:middle
app, make that a part of your

00:05:52.386 --> 00:05:52.936 A:middle
notifications.

00:05:54.506 --> 00:05:55.836 A:middle
So here is a Missed Call in

00:05:55.836 --> 00:05:56.886 A:middle
Voicemail notification.

00:05:57.136 --> 00:05:58.616 A:middle
I can see my friend, Chance, he

00:05:58.616 --> 00:05:59.626 A:middle
gave me a call, left a

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:00.116 A:middle
voicemail.

00:06:01.066 --> 00:06:01.996 A:middle
And when I get to the Long Look

00:06:01.996 --> 00:06:03.556 A:middle
here, I can see the missed call,

00:06:03.556 --> 00:06:04.836 A:middle
I can listen to the audio

00:06:04.836 --> 00:06:06.006 A:middle
message or I can just read the

00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:07.836 A:middle
transcription, all without ever

00:06:07.836 --> 00:06:09.026 A:middle
having to go into the phone app.

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:10.786 A:middle
Everything I need to know about

00:06:10.786 --> 00:06:11.796 A:middle
the missed call is here, the

00:06:11.796 --> 00:06:13.356 A:middle
audio, the transcript, and some

00:06:13.356 --> 00:06:14.066 A:middle
relevant actions.

00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:15.646 A:middle
It's a nice, self-contained

00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:16.086 A:middle
package.

00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:19.776 A:middle
So we've talked about you can

00:06:19.776 --> 00:06:21.586 A:middle
add images, you can add video,

00:06:21.586 --> 00:06:22.876 A:middle
audio to your notifications,

00:06:23.086 --> 00:06:24.136 A:middle
well the next thing you could do

00:06:24.386 --> 00:06:25.576 A:middle
is have a custom view that

00:06:25.576 --> 00:06:26.236 A:middle
updates live.

00:06:26.276 --> 00:06:27.616 A:middle
So here is Find My Friends.

00:06:27.856 --> 00:06:28.586 A:middle
Chance wants to share his

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:29.336 A:middle
location with me.

00:06:29.336 --> 00:06:30.936 A:middle
And when I expand this

00:06:30.936 --> 00:06:32.256 A:middle
notification, I get to see his

00:06:32.256 --> 00:06:33.066 A:middle
current location.

00:06:33.676 --> 00:06:35.046 A:middle
So you can update the content of

00:06:35.046 --> 00:06:36.476 A:middle
a Long Look in real time.

00:06:36.706 --> 00:06:37.796 A:middle
So any case where you're using a

00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:39.396 A:middle
map, that is a nice example.

00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:41.276 A:middle
So if you have a social app, you

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:42.756 A:middle
could see your friends, maybe

00:06:42.756 --> 00:06:43.976 A:middle
some sort of delivery service,

00:06:44.336 --> 00:06:45.626 A:middle
flight tracking, things like

00:06:45.626 --> 00:06:46.206 A:middle
that.

00:06:46.436 --> 00:06:47.896 A:middle
Or if you have dynamic data in

00:06:47.896 --> 00:06:48.726 A:middle
your app, something that is

00:06:48.726 --> 00:06:50.086 A:middle
based on live events, update

00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:50.686 A:middle
that too.

00:06:50.926 --> 00:06:52.306 A:middle
Stock prices, sports scores,

00:06:52.606 --> 00:06:54.896 A:middle
social feeds, things like that.

00:06:54.896 --> 00:06:55.986 A:middle
If your app updates in real

00:06:55.986 --> 00:06:57.516 A:middle
time, your notifications should

00:06:57.516 --> 00:06:58.296 A:middle
update in real time.

00:07:00.256 --> 00:07:01.606 A:middle
And finally, you can go totally

00:07:01.606 --> 00:07:03.016 A:middle
custom and build a really rich

00:07:03.136 --> 00:07:03.916 A:middle
[inaudible] experience.

00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:05.086 A:middle
So I can see my friend Chance,

00:07:05.256 --> 00:07:08.026 A:middle
he sends me an iMessage, when I

00:07:08.026 --> 00:07:09.386 A:middle
expand this, I see Messages

00:07:09.386 --> 00:07:11.026 A:middle
draws the actual conversation,

00:07:11.316 --> 00:07:12.396 A:middle
straight with bobbles and

00:07:12.396 --> 00:07:13.596 A:middle
effects, and images and

00:07:13.596 --> 00:07:15.666 A:middle
attachments, and because the

00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:17.046 A:middle
thread updates live, if he

00:07:17.046 --> 00:07:18.976 A:middle
starts typing, we present the

00:07:18.976 --> 00:07:19.546 A:middle
indicator.

00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:20.746 A:middle
And I think that is a really

00:07:20.746 --> 00:07:22.176 A:middle
helpful piece of information

00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:23.526 A:middle
because it lets me know to keep

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.146 A:middle
the notification open for just a

00:07:25.146 --> 00:07:27.216 A:middle
moment longer, because when he

00:07:27.216 --> 00:07:28.596 A:middle
sends his next message, the

00:07:28.596 --> 00:07:29.986 A:middle
thread updates, and it appears

00:07:29.986 --> 00:07:30.546 A:middle
right inline.

00:07:30.976 --> 00:07:32.076 A:middle
Now, if I want to engage in the

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:33.756 A:middle
conversation I can reply to him,

00:07:33.896 --> 00:07:35.126 A:middle
and we can go back and forth,

00:07:35.576 --> 00:07:36.926 A:middle
and keep our conversation going

00:07:36.926 --> 00:07:37.806 A:middle
until we're through.

00:07:38.266 --> 00:07:39.436 A:middle
Once we're done chatting, I just

00:07:39.436 --> 00:07:40.856 A:middle
swipe the notification away, and

00:07:40.896 --> 00:07:41.986 A:middle
I get back to what I was just

00:07:41.986 --> 00:07:42.216 A:middle
doing.

00:07:44.906 --> 00:07:46.036 A:middle
So, Mic is a really cool app

00:07:46.036 --> 00:07:47.896 A:middle
that builds a big part of their

00:07:47.896 --> 00:07:48.846 A:middle
experience around our

00:07:48.846 --> 00:07:49.926 A:middle
notification platform.

00:07:50.406 --> 00:07:51.336 A:middle
So I can see they posted a

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:52.736 A:middle
Breaking News alert about a

00:07:52.736 --> 00:07:54.446 A:middle
secret government spacecraft, I

00:07:54.446 --> 00:07:54.716 A:middle
think.

00:07:54.716 --> 00:07:55.626 A:middle
You know that sounds pretty

00:07:55.626 --> 00:07:56.766 A:middle
cool, let me read that story.

00:07:56.766 --> 00:07:58.986 A:middle
So when I expand the Long Look,

00:07:58.986 --> 00:08:00.926 A:middle
I get to see a big photograph

00:08:01.116 --> 00:08:01.856 A:middle
from the article.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.616 A:middle
I get the headline, and I get to

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:04.836 A:middle
read the rest of the story.

00:08:05.196 --> 00:08:06.066 A:middle
I think it's really great.

00:08:06.166 --> 00:08:07.026 A:middle
You know, I expanded this

00:08:07.026 --> 00:08:08.046 A:middle
notification because I was

00:08:08.046 --> 00:08:09.726 A:middle
interested in the story and now

00:08:09.726 --> 00:08:10.776 A:middle
I get to read the whole thing,

00:08:10.776 --> 00:08:12.256 A:middle
and I never lost context of what

00:08:12.256 --> 00:08:12.726 A:middle
I was doing.

00:08:15.256 --> 00:08:17.186 A:middle
Castro is my favorite podcast

00:08:17.186 --> 00:08:17.466 A:middle
app.

00:08:17.466 --> 00:08:18.246 A:middle
It's really great.

00:08:18.246 --> 00:08:19.726 A:middle
It's really well done, and I get

00:08:19.726 --> 00:08:20.756 A:middle
a notification every time there

00:08:20.756 --> 00:08:21.456 A:middle
is a new episode.

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:24.536 A:middle
So here, in the Long Look, I get

00:08:24.536 --> 00:08:25.886 A:middle
to see the title, there's the

00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:27.316 A:middle
duration, there's a nice

00:08:27.346 --> 00:08:28.706 A:middle
description, and even a

00:08:28.706 --> 00:08:30.036 A:middle
thumbnail of the show's artwork

00:08:30.036 --> 00:08:30.856 A:middle
there in the bottom right.

00:08:31.156 --> 00:08:32.366 A:middle
And what's nice here is that

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:33.626 A:middle
it's typeset just like their

00:08:33.626 --> 00:08:34.256 A:middle
app.

00:08:34.326 --> 00:08:35.336 A:middle
So I think this is a really nice

00:08:35.336 --> 00:08:37.146 A:middle
example of how an app can bring

00:08:37.146 --> 00:08:38.516 A:middle
their custom design language

00:08:38.836 --> 00:08:39.826 A:middle
from their app into the

00:08:39.826 --> 00:08:41.076 A:middle
notification experience.

00:08:41.176 --> 00:08:42.306 A:middle
It's really well considered.

00:08:42.306 --> 00:08:42.986 A:middle
It is really great.

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:44.706 A:middle
And the Quick Actions are nice,

00:08:44.746 --> 00:08:44.986 A:middle
too.

00:08:44.986 --> 00:08:46.016 A:middle
You know, now that I've learned

00:08:46.016 --> 00:08:47.746 A:middle
more about the show, I can just

00:08:47.746 --> 00:08:48.326 A:middle
start listening.

00:08:51.296 --> 00:08:52.126 A:middle
And finally, Kuna.

00:08:52.336 --> 00:08:53.326 A:middle
This is one of my favorite

00:08:53.326 --> 00:08:53.836 A:middle
examples.

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:55.306 A:middle
You know, this is a smart camera

00:08:55.306 --> 00:08:56.466 A:middle
that you can place by your front

00:08:56.466 --> 00:08:56.826 A:middle
door.

00:08:57.126 --> 00:08:58.326 A:middle
So here, you get a notification

00:08:58.326 --> 00:08:59.326 A:middle
letting you know that your

00:08:59.526 --> 00:09:00.476 A:middle
camera has detected some

00:09:00.476 --> 00:09:01.456 A:middle
activity outside.

00:09:02.116 --> 00:09:03.596 A:middle
And I just think this is like

00:09:03.596 --> 00:09:04.956 A:middle
the perfect case for a Long

00:09:04.956 --> 00:09:05.166 A:middle
Look.

00:09:05.266 --> 00:09:06.086 A:middle
You know, if you are telling me

00:09:06.086 --> 00:09:07.596 A:middle
someone is at my front door, you

00:09:07.596 --> 00:09:08.556 A:middle
know, I want to see it, right?

00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:09.656 A:middle
Like, I just want to play the

00:09:09.656 --> 00:09:11.356 A:middle
video back right in the Long

00:09:11.356 --> 00:09:11.606 A:middle
Look.

00:09:11.876 --> 00:09:12.776 A:middle
So let's see what was happening

00:09:12.776 --> 00:09:13.246 A:middle
outside.

00:09:13.836 --> 00:09:14.916 A:middle
It looks like my friend, Chance,

00:09:14.916 --> 00:09:16.546 A:middle
is stopping by [laughter], oh,

00:09:17.776 --> 00:09:18.266 A:middle
that's funny.

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:19.766 A:middle
There's a real video for this

00:09:19.766 --> 00:09:20.326 A:middle
camera, too.

00:09:20.716 --> 00:09:21.136 A:middle
He's okay.

00:09:21.136 --> 00:09:22.716 A:middle
And the click actions, too, "Can

00:09:22.716 --> 00:09:23.146 A:middle
I help you?"

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:24.756 A:middle
I think that's nice [laughter].

00:09:25.836 --> 00:09:27.856 A:middle
All right, so let's recap here.

00:09:28.546 --> 00:09:29.526 A:middle
Let's make sure the Short Look

00:09:29.526 --> 00:09:31.136 A:middle
is giving you clear information

00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:32.266 A:middle
about what the notification is

00:09:32.336 --> 00:09:32.636 A:middle
for.

00:09:33.846 --> 00:09:34.866 A:middle
Let's make sure the Long Look is

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.226 A:middle
providing more context around

00:09:36.226 --> 00:09:37.656 A:middle
the notification and bringing

00:09:37.656 --> 00:09:38.616 A:middle
out some of those wonderful

00:09:38.616 --> 00:09:39.966 A:middle
design details from your apps

00:09:40.376 --> 00:09:41.316 A:middle
into the notifications.

00:09:42.926 --> 00:09:43.646 A:middle
Let's make sure we have some

00:09:43.646 --> 00:09:44.596 A:middle
relevant Actions.

00:09:44.866 --> 00:09:45.816 A:middle
Remember, I am going to be able

00:09:45.816 --> 00:09:47.046 A:middle
to do everything I need to do,

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:47.966 A:middle
and just take care of the

00:09:47.966 --> 00:09:48.616 A:middle
notification.

00:09:49.246 --> 00:09:50.066 A:middle
You know, because if we all get

00:09:50.066 --> 00:09:51.546 A:middle
together and we do that, the

00:09:51.546 --> 00:09:54.346 A:middle
next time you hear this [bell

00:09:54.346 --> 00:09:54.906 A:middle
rings], and the next time you

00:09:54.906 --> 00:09:56.866 A:middle
see this, we won't have to

00:09:56.866 --> 00:09:58.236 A:middle
worry, because we will know all

00:09:58.236 --> 00:09:59.186 A:middle
those notifications will be

00:09:59.186 --> 00:10:00.116 A:middle
something that is really great.

00:10:01.276 --> 00:10:01.576 A:middle
Thank you.
