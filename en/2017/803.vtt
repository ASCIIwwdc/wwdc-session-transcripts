I'm Hugo Verweij, sound designer

I had the pleasure on working of

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:48.936 A:middle
many of the sounds you hear

00:00:49.296 --> 00:00:51.616 A:middle
through your Apple devices, and

00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:53.346 A:middle
I love thinking about these kind

00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:54.086 A:middle
of questions.

00:00:55.126 --> 00:00:56.826 A:middle
There are probably some

musicians in the room, maybe

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.596 A:middle
even one or two sound designers,

00:01:00.596 --> 00:01:02.296 A:middle
but that is by no means required

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:03.006 A:middle
for this talk.

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:05.046 A:middle
This session is for everyone,

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:06.906 A:middle
even if you've never recorded a

00:01:06.906 --> 00:01:08.296 A:middle
single sound in your life.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:11.356 A:middle
I'm also not going to teach you

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:12.776 A:middle
how to become a sound designer,

00:01:12.776 --> 00:01:14.256 A:middle
but I hope I'm going to give you

00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:16.656 A:middle
some ideas of how to incorporate

00:01:16.656 --> 00:01:19.226 A:middle
sound in your design process and

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:20.456 A:middle
why it makes sense to do so.

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:23.466 A:middle
Now, as a developer, you have a

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.906 A:middle
lot on your plate and adding

00:01:24.906 --> 00:01:26.486 A:middle
sound to your app is probably

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:28.446 A:middle
not super high on your to-do

00:01:28.446 --> 00:01:30.926 A:middle
list, but I like to make the

00:01:30.926 --> 00:01:33.536 A:middle
case that sound, if used the

00:01:33.536 --> 00:01:35.836 A:middle
right way, really can help

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:52.386 A:middle
to use our ears for a little

00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:57.396 A:middle
I'd like to ask you all to just

close your eyes for one minute,

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:02.296 A:middle

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:17.026 A:middle
Sound has this magical ability

So what we hear has a big impact

on how we feel and what we do,

00:05:18.796 --> 00:05:20.956 A:middle

the things going on around us.

00:05:25.036 --> 00:05:26.606 A:middle
Now we know that sound is such a

00:05:26.606 --> 00:05:27.536 A:middle
powerful medium.

00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:29.566 A:middle
How can we use it in our design?

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:33.446 A:middle
Many people think that design is

00:05:33.446 --> 00:05:35.626 A:middle
about what a product looks like

00:05:35.906 --> 00:05:38.406 A:middle
or at Apple we pay a lot of

00:05:38.406 --> 00:05:40.626 A:middle
attention to, how it works.

00:05:41.606 --> 00:05:43.136 A:middle
We think design is also about

00:05:43.136 --> 00:05:45.726 A:middle
what it feels like and what it

00:05:45.726 --> 00:05:46.336 A:middle
sounds like.

00:05:47.776 --> 00:05:49.726 A:middle

00:05:50.936 --> 00:05:53.096 A:middle
It's like using a universal

00:05:53.096 --> 00:05:54.516 A:middle

understood by everyone.

00:05:56.096 --> 00:05:59.696 A:middle
It helps shape the experience of

a product.

00:06:00.836 --> 00:06:02.596 A:middle
It helps us understand

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:03.606 A:middle
interactions better.

00:06:03.606 --> 00:06:07.296 A:middle
And it gives our devices a voice

00:06:07.296 --> 00:06:08.866 A:middle
so they can tell us things, they

00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:10.006 A:middle
can talk back to us.

understand what's going on.

00:06:59.046 --> 00:07:00.726 A:middle
It's like a way for our phone to

So how can we improve on this?

00:07:10.776 --> 00:07:13.286 A:middle
Well, if your app relies on

00:07:13.286 --> 00:07:15.936 A:middle
notifications, it makes a lot of

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:17.556 A:middle
sense to think about creating

that notification?

that it's coming from your app?

00:07:30.136 --> 00:07:31.646 A:middle
If you don't do this, you are

much about where it's coming

00:08:07.666 --> 00:08:08.756 A:middle
When you hear this, you know

00:08:09.046 --> 00:08:10.246 A:middle
it's coming from Dark Sky.

00:08:11.106 --> 00:08:12.806 A:middle
It conveys a message.

00:08:12.806 --> 00:08:14.566 A:middle
It's not a direct recording of

00:08:14.566 --> 00:08:16.056 A:middle
raindrops, but it has this

00:08:16.056 --> 00:08:17.366 A:middle
liquid quality to it.

00:08:17.366 --> 00:08:20.056 A:middle
It helps you connect the sound

00:08:20.056 --> 00:08:21.186 A:middle
to the message it's sending.

00:08:21.776 --> 00:08:24.366 A:middle
It's a friendly sound.

00:08:24.736 --> 00:08:26.296 A:middle
It's not jarring, but telling

00:08:26.296 --> 00:08:28.156 A:middle
you in a friendly way it's time

00:08:28.156 --> 00:08:29.086 A:middle
to find cover soon.

00:08:30.096 --> 00:08:31.966 A:middle
And it's a simple and clean

00:08:32.026 --> 00:08:34.746 A:middle
sound, quite pleasant to listen

00:08:34.746 --> 00:08:38.136 A:middle
to as well.

00:08:38.286 --> 00:08:40.126 A:middle
So let's try this ourselves.

00:08:40.126 --> 00:08:41.526 A:middle
Let's create a sound for an app.

00:08:41.686 --> 00:08:44.286 A:middle
Shall we? Well, first we need an

00:08:44.286 --> 00:08:44.876 A:middle
app, of course.

00:08:44.876 --> 00:08:47.936 A:middle
Well, luckily, some years ago,

00:08:47.936 --> 00:08:50.106 A:middle
our prototyping team did a

00:08:50.106 --> 00:08:50.606 A:middle
session.

00:08:50.686 --> 00:08:52.536 A:middle
It was called "Fake It Till You

00:08:52.536 --> 00:08:52.906 A:middle
Make It."

00:08:52.906 --> 00:08:54.586 A:middle
It was about creating fake apps

00:08:54.586 --> 00:08:56.086 A:middle
in order to learn from how

00:08:56.086 --> 00:08:57.246 A:middle
people would interact with them.

00:08:58.326 --> 00:08:59.546 A:middle
They create an app called Toast

00:08:59.546 --> 00:08:59.976 A:middle
Modern.

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:04.156 A:middle
Now, maybe some of you know that

00:09:04.156 --> 00:09:05.596 A:middle
toast has become very popular in

00:09:05.596 --> 00:09:07.916 A:middle
San Francisco, and people pay a

00:09:07.916 --> 00:09:10.146 A:middle
lot of money for a slice of what

00:09:10.146 --> 00:09:11.766 A:middle
some call hipster toast.

00:09:14.786 --> 00:09:16.176 A:middle
Toast Modern, the app they

00:09:16.176 --> 00:09:18.346 A:middle
created, helps you find

00:09:19.576 --> 00:09:21.126 A:middle
overpriced artisanal toast on

00:09:21.126 --> 00:09:22.256 A:middle
the streets of San Francisco

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:25.416 A:middle
[laughter] and share this with

00:09:25.416 --> 00:09:27.386 A:middle
your friends and family.

00:09:27.946 --> 00:09:33.176 A:middle
Now if someone sends you some

00:09:33.176 --> 00:09:34.626 A:middle
newly discovered toast, you get

00:09:34.626 --> 00:09:35.396 A:middle
a notification.

00:09:35.816 --> 00:09:36.966 A:middle
So we can create a sound for

00:09:36.966 --> 00:09:37.786 A:middle
this notification.

00:09:38.196 --> 00:09:38.986 A:middle
Let's do that.

00:09:40.736 --> 00:09:41.926 A:middle
We can start by asking ourselves

00:09:41.926 --> 00:09:43.836 A:middle
some questions, like, "What is

00:09:43.836 --> 00:09:45.396 A:middle
the essence of what this app is

00:09:45.396 --> 00:09:45.736 A:middle
about?"

00:09:46.816 --> 00:09:48.546 A:middle
Well, in this case, simple.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.246 A:middle
It's about finding toast and

00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:52.696 A:middle
sharing it with your friends.

00:09:52.856 --> 00:09:54.636 A:middle
What emotion do we want to evoke

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:55.896 A:middle
here when people receive this

00:09:55.896 --> 00:09:56.686 A:middle
notification?

00:09:56.726 --> 00:09:58.566 A:middle
Well, we want them to be happy

00:09:58.566 --> 00:09:59.966 A:middle
they found some new toast to try

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:01.496 A:middle
and eager to try it out.

00:10:02.846 --> 00:10:05.246 A:middle
How do we match the app's

00:10:05.306 --> 00:10:05.986 A:middle
aesthetics?

00:10:05.986 --> 00:10:09.626 A:middle
We just saw the screen, and it

00:10:09.626 --> 00:10:11.016 A:middle
looks pretty functional and

00:10:11.016 --> 00:10:12.776 A:middle
simple, so let's keep the sound

00:10:12.776 --> 00:10:15.616 A:middle
similar to that, keep it simple

00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:16.276 A:middle
and to the point.

00:10:16.906 --> 00:10:19.626 A:middle
And if we notice, we can start

00:10:19.626 --> 00:10:21.796 A:middle
with some sound sources.

00:10:21.796 --> 00:10:23.516 A:middle
We can record some sounds to be

00:10:23.516 --> 00:10:24.326 A:middle
inspired by.

00:10:24.326 --> 00:10:26.386 A:middle
In this case, let's just get

00:10:26.386 --> 00:10:26.846 A:middle
some bread.

00:10:26.846 --> 00:10:29.216 A:middle
Let's get a toaster and record

00:10:29.216 --> 00:10:29.756 A:middle
those sounds.

00:10:30.506 --> 00:10:32.976 A:middle
So that's exactly what we did,

00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:33.976 A:middle
and here are some of the sounds

00:10:33.976 --> 00:10:34.546 A:middle
we recorded.

00:10:35.486 --> 00:10:37.486 A:middle
[ Toaster popping ]

00:10:37.956 --> 00:10:39.126 A:middle
Toaster ejecting toast.

00:10:42.306 --> 00:10:43.526 A:middle
Spreading butter on a piece of

00:10:43.526 --> 00:10:43.936 A:middle
toast.

00:10:44.516 --> 00:10:47.036 A:middle
[ Bread Crumbling ]

00:10:47.536 --> 00:10:48.856 A:middle
The sound of toast breaking.

00:10:51.056 --> 00:10:52.656 A:middle
And taking a bite out of a piece

00:10:52.656 --> 00:10:53.016 A:middle
of toast.

00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:55.076 A:middle
Now we can also create a little

00:10:55.076 --> 00:10:56.026 A:middle
bit of a story from the

00:10:56.026 --> 00:10:57.606 A:middle
beginning to the end, you know,

00:10:58.076 --> 00:10:59.566 A:middle
making toast and eating toast,

00:10:59.676 --> 00:11:00.660 A:middle
and record the whole process.

00:11:01.016 --> 00:11:03.016 A:middle
[toaster popping].

00:11:03.016 --> 00:11:04.676 A:middle
[timer ticking].

00:11:05.176 --> 00:11:07.516 A:middle
[chiming].

00:11:08.016 --> 00:11:10.016 A:middle
[scraping toast].

00:11:10.016 --> 00:11:11.436 A:middle
[toast crunching].

00:11:11.436 --> 00:11:12.856 A:middle
[laughter].

00:11:12.856 --> 00:11:15.706 A:middle
Okay, now we have a nice

00:11:15.706 --> 00:11:16.416 A:middle
palette.

00:11:16.726 --> 00:11:18.226 A:middle
You notice we added some sounds

00:11:18.226 --> 00:11:20.286 A:middle
to this, because in the initial

00:11:20.286 --> 00:11:21.916 A:middle
set, there was not that timer

00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:23.236 A:middle
sound and the chime sounds, so

00:11:23.236 --> 00:11:24.276 A:middle
we recorded those two.

00:11:24.776 --> 00:11:26.346 A:middle
And now we can start making

00:11:27.096 --> 00:11:29.576 A:middle
notification sounds.

00:11:30.286 --> 00:11:31.366 A:middle
There's one sound that I like

00:11:31.366 --> 00:11:32.596 A:middle
quite a bit.

00:11:32.596 --> 00:11:33.786 A:middle
[toast crunching].

00:11:33.786 --> 00:11:34.636 A:middle
It's a great sound.

00:11:34.636 --> 00:11:35.936 A:middle
It's very characteristic, but

00:11:36.956 --> 00:11:38.466 A:middle
maybe it doesn't work so well as

00:11:38.466 --> 00:11:39.646 A:middle
a notification coming from your

00:11:39.646 --> 00:11:40.676 A:middle
phone every day, right?

00:11:40.676 --> 00:11:42.076 A:middle
It's a little harsh.

00:11:42.716 --> 00:11:45.446 A:middle
So how about this one?

00:11:45.446 --> 00:11:46.356 A:middle
[timer ticking].

00:11:46.356 --> 00:11:47.266 A:middle
[chiming].

00:11:47.266 --> 00:11:48.676 A:middle
There's this little timer sound

00:11:48.676 --> 00:11:50.706 A:middle
and then the chime, but the only

00:11:50.706 --> 00:11:51.846 A:middle
thing I don't really like about

00:11:51.846 --> 00:11:53.756 A:middle
it is the sound of the toaster

00:11:53.756 --> 00:11:54.716 A:middle
ejecting the toast.

00:11:54.716 --> 00:11:55.500 A:middle
It's a little harsh.

00:11:55.776 --> 00:11:58.616 A:middle
So we can find a more expensive

00:11:58.696 --> 00:12:00.266 A:middle
toaster maybe, that'll sound

00:12:00.266 --> 00:12:02.856 A:middle
better, or we can construct our

00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:04.266 A:middle
own toaster sound.

00:12:05.466 --> 00:12:06.846 A:middle
But why don't we just take away

00:12:06.846 --> 00:12:07.806 A:middle
the parts we don't like and see

00:12:07.806 --> 00:12:08.330 A:middle
what we're left with?

00:12:09.506 --> 00:12:12.976 A:middle
So let's take that sound out.

00:12:12.976 --> 00:12:13.043 A:middle
[timer ticking].

00:12:13.043 --> 00:12:13.110 A:middle
[chiming].

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.656 A:middle
Actually, this might work pretty

00:12:15.656 --> 00:12:16.036 A:middle
well.

00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:18.266 A:middle
Let's see what it looks like

00:12:18.266 --> 00:12:19.000 A:middle
when the notification comes in.

00:12:20.016 --> 00:12:21.016 A:middle
[timer ticking].

00:12:21.516 --> 00:12:23.766 A:middle
[chiming].

00:12:24.266 --> 00:12:25.896 A:middle
I think this is pretty good for

00:12:25.896 --> 00:12:26.086 A:middle
now.

00:12:26.576 --> 00:12:28.056 A:middle
Now remember, we're just trying

00:12:28.056 --> 00:12:28.536 A:middle
things out.

00:12:29.266 --> 00:12:30.386 A:middle
We're just prototyping.

00:12:30.936 --> 00:12:31.886 A:middle
Even the app is fake.

00:12:32.106 --> 00:12:34.786 A:middle
So, you know, we're not all

00:12:34.786 --> 00:12:36.606 A:middle
sound designers, but once we

00:12:36.606 --> 00:12:38.076 A:middle
start working with a sound

00:12:38.076 --> 00:12:39.016 A:middle
designer, they can take this

00:12:39.016 --> 00:12:40.846 A:middle
inspiration and maybe create

00:12:40.846 --> 00:12:42.776 A:middle
something that's more unique,

00:12:42.776 --> 00:12:44.746 A:middle
more ownable, and maybe more

00:12:44.746 --> 00:12:46.226 A:middle
abstract, like the Dark Sky

00:12:46.226 --> 00:12:47.000 A:middle
notification.

00:12:50.476 --> 00:12:51.956 A:middle
Now what did the creative

00:12:51.956 --> 00:12:53.346 A:middle
process look like here?

00:12:54.416 --> 00:12:55.566 A:middle
We started out with all these

00:12:55.916 --> 00:12:56.706 A:middle
toast recordings.

00:12:56.706 --> 00:12:57.646 A:middle
Those are the blue dots.

00:12:57.976 --> 00:12:59.336 A:middle
And then we realized we needed

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:00.706 A:middle
some other sounds to complete

00:13:00.706 --> 00:13:02.236 A:middle
the palette, so we added the

00:13:02.276 --> 00:13:03.816 A:middle
timer sound and the chime sound.

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:04.826 A:middle
Those are the yellow ones.

00:13:05.286 --> 00:13:07.136 A:middle
And then we created some

00:13:07.246 --> 00:13:09.006 A:middle
candidates and tried them out on

00:13:09.006 --> 00:13:09.816 A:middle
our device.

00:13:10.626 --> 00:13:12.326 A:middle
We found out that a lot of these

00:13:12.326 --> 00:13:13.566 A:middle
sounds didn't really work so

00:13:13.566 --> 00:13:16.156 A:middle
well, so we ended up with the

00:13:16.156 --> 00:13:18.416 A:middle
timer and the chime sound.

00:13:19.316 --> 00:13:21.506 A:middle
Now why am I showing you this?

00:13:22.656 --> 00:13:24.206 A:middle
Because it illustrates how often

00:13:24.206 --> 00:13:25.076 A:middle
we start out with this

00:13:25.076 --> 00:13:26.446 A:middle
assumption that something might

00:13:26.486 --> 00:13:28.836 A:middle
work, but then we find out that,

00:13:28.836 --> 00:13:30.876 A:middle
going this exploration phase, we

00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:32.586 A:middle
find out that what we really

00:13:32.586 --> 00:13:33.936 A:middle
need is something different.

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:35.806 A:middle
We have to go through this to

00:13:35.806 --> 00:13:36.976 A:middle
understand that.

00:13:37.436 --> 00:13:38.956 A:middle
First we have to make mistakes

00:13:38.956 --> 00:13:40.276 A:middle
to come up with something great.

00:13:40.526 --> 00:13:44.986 A:middle
Now what kind of sound sources

00:13:45.356 --> 00:13:46.486 A:middle
can you record when you do an

00:13:46.486 --> 00:13:49.006 A:middle
exploration like this?

00:13:49.226 --> 00:13:50.666 A:middle
You could record an acoustic

00:13:50.666 --> 00:13:54.216 A:middle
instrument or an electronic

00:13:54.216 --> 00:13:55.816 A:middle
instrument, like a synthesizer

00:13:55.816 --> 00:13:57.026 A:middle
software or hardware.

00:13:58.406 --> 00:13:59.736 A:middle
But really, we found out you can

00:13:59.736 --> 00:14:00.536 A:middle
record anything.

00:14:01.956 --> 00:14:04.696 A:middle
Anything that makes a sound can

00:14:04.696 --> 00:14:06.276 A:middle
be an inspiration.

00:14:06.926 --> 00:14:11.726 A:middle
Now at Apple, we use any of

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:12.826 A:middle
these sound sources.

00:14:13.396 --> 00:14:16.666 A:middle
It really depends on the project

00:14:16.666 --> 00:14:19.356 A:middle
we're working on, and some of

00:14:19.356 --> 00:14:20.886 A:middle
them are easily recognizable

00:14:20.886 --> 00:14:21.516 A:middle
instruments.

00:14:23.486 --> 00:14:24.786 A:middle
These sounds may be played

00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:27.676 A:middle
millions of times per day.

00:14:30.696 --> 00:14:32.216 A:middle
Earlier this year, Tim mentioned

00:14:32.216 --> 00:14:33.816 A:middle

this sound since it was

00:15:36.666 --> 00:15:38.516 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:15:38.986 --> 00:15:40.886 A:middle
We use this notification sound

00:15:40.916 --> 00:15:41.656 A:middle
for messages.

00:15:42.256 --> 00:15:44.146 A:middle
Why does this work well for

00:15:44.146 --> 00:15:44.806 A:middle

00:15:45.216 --> 00:15:47.326 A:middle
We have to think about, when

00:15:47.326 --> 00:15:49.196 A:middle
will people hear this sound, and

00:15:49.196 --> 00:15:50.406 A:middle
what will they be doing?

00:15:50.736 --> 00:15:51.966 A:middle
They have their phones in a

00:15:52.026 --> 00:15:54.066 A:middle

00:15:54.066 --> 00:15:56.226 A:middle
Maybe they are on a busy city

00:15:58.426 --> 00:16:00.706 A:middle
So we have to cut through the

00:16:00.706 --> 00:16:02.126 A:middle
noise of these locations.

00:16:02.326 --> 00:16:04.286 A:middle
It needs to be very clean and

00:16:04.286 --> 00:16:06.476 A:middle
simple, but there's another

00:16:06.476 --> 00:16:08.886 A:middle
thing that is important that we

00:16:08.886 --> 00:16:11.966 A:middle
don't really want to, you know,

you're sending.

00:16:15.986 --> 00:16:17.406 A:middle
It's very different than the

sending with it.

00:16:23.786 --> 00:16:25.236 A:middle
So we want it to be very neutral

00:16:25.236 --> 00:16:25.696 A:middle
as well.

00:16:56.406 --> 00:16:58.866 A:middle

00:17:04.016 --> 00:17:05.156 A:middle
Absolutely.

00:17:06.096 --> 00:17:09.236 A:middle
It's a little bit more of a

00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:10.996 A:middle
characteristic sound, because

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:11.766 A:middle
it's not a very common

00:17:11.766 --> 00:17:13.006 A:middle
instrument, but again, it's very

00:17:13.006 --> 00:17:14.576 A:middle
simple and clear as well.

00:17:15.626 --> 00:17:18.346 A:middle
Now when we were designing for

00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:20.696 A:middle
the watch, we asked our self the

00:17:20.696 --> 00:17:22.166 A:middle
question, how can we be inspired

00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:23.716 A:middle
by this beautiful industrial

00:17:23.716 --> 00:17:24.846 A:middle
design of this device?

00:17:25.866 --> 00:17:27.676 A:middle
And how can we create the

00:17:27.676 --> 00:17:30.226 A:middle
illusion that what you hear,

00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:32.586 A:middle
that the sounds are actually

00:17:32.656 --> 00:17:35.806 A:middle
made by the device itself, that

00:17:35.806 --> 00:17:37.756 A:middle
they're coming from the device

00:17:37.756 --> 00:17:38.176 A:middle
itself?

00:17:39.196 --> 00:17:40.446 A:middle
So we decided to record the

00:17:40.446 --> 00:17:42.226 A:middle
different materials, the

00:17:42.226 --> 00:17:43.596 A:middle
stainless steel, the aluminum,

00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:44.086 A:middle
and the gold.

00:17:45.216 --> 00:17:46.806 A:middle
And what I have here is the

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:49.806 A:middle
housing of a stainless steel

00:17:49.806 --> 00:17:50.336 A:middle

00:17:50.946 --> 00:17:54.656 A:middle
Now we can hit that in different

00:17:54.656 --> 00:17:58.036 A:middle
ways and see if it makes a

00:17:58.456 --> 00:17:58.586 A:middle

00:17:58.586 --> 00:17:59.416 A:middle

00:17:59.416 --> 00:18:02.556 A:middle

characteristics of a good

00:19:25.926 --> 00:19:28.336 A:middle
It's distinguishable.

00:19:29.256 --> 00:19:31.046 A:middle
You know which app is sending

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:31.536 A:middle
the sound.

00:19:32.736 --> 00:19:34.196 A:middle
It matches the design of the

00:19:34.196 --> 00:19:34.456 A:middle
app.

00:19:34.456 --> 00:19:36.086 A:middle
So you're creating an app that

00:19:36.086 --> 00:19:38.166 A:middle
looks very cartoony, let's say.

00:19:38.166 --> 00:19:39.766 A:middle
You may want to look at some

00:19:39.766 --> 00:19:41.726 A:middle
sounds that really match that

00:19:41.726 --> 00:19:42.266 A:middle
aesthetic.

00:19:42.756 --> 00:19:43.826 A:middle
Or if your app is very

00:19:44.246 --> 00:19:46.046 A:middle
minimalist, then maybe you want

00:19:46.046 --> 00:19:47.066 A:middle
to start with some very simple

00:19:47.066 --> 00:19:47.666 A:middle
sounds.

00:19:49.006 --> 00:19:51.056 A:middle
It's unobtrusive and repeatable.

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:53.716 A:middle
This means that even if you use

00:19:53.716 --> 00:19:55.726 A:middle
it multiple times per day that

00:19:55.726 --> 00:19:56.846 A:middle
it doesn't become annoying.

00:19:58.136 --> 00:19:59.556 A:middle
A great way to try this out is

00:19:59.556 --> 00:20:01.216 A:middle
just to put it on your phone for

00:20:01.216 --> 00:20:02.216 A:middle
a little while, for a week or

00:20:02.216 --> 00:20:03.886 A:middle
so, and live with it for a

00:20:03.886 --> 00:20:03.976 A:middle
while.

00:20:05.056 --> 00:20:06.506 A:middle
If after a week you still like

00:20:06.506 --> 00:20:08.156 A:middle
the sound, it's probably a

00:20:08.156 --> 00:20:08.906 A:middle
pretty good one.

00:20:10.056 --> 00:20:11.256 A:middle
And then it's clear.

00:20:11.706 --> 00:20:12.466 A:middle
It's clean.

00:20:13.476 --> 00:20:15.366 A:middle
It cuts through noise, but it's

00:20:15.366 --> 00:20:16.016 A:middle
not abrasive.

00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:20.136 A:middle
All right.

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:23.746 A:middle
Next, let's look at designing

00:20:23.746 --> 00:20:26.500 A:middle
sound for UI elements.

00:20:35.626 --> 00:20:37.346 A:middle
Now every object you interact

00:20:37.346 --> 00:20:39.636 A:middle
with in the real world makes a

00:20:39.636 --> 00:20:42.826 A:middle
sound, so it's very natural to

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:44.606 A:middle
expect that an object you

00:20:44.606 --> 00:20:45.846 A:middle
interact with on the screen

00:20:46.426 --> 00:20:48.146 A:middle
makes a sound as well, but we

00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:49.816 A:middle
definitely don't do this for

00:20:49.816 --> 00:20:50.566 A:middle
every interaction.

00:20:51.316 --> 00:20:53.436 A:middle
We really try to find the right

00:20:53.506 --> 00:20:55.716 A:middle
balance between no sound and too

00:20:55.716 --> 00:20:56.116 A:middle
much.

00:20:58.296 --> 00:20:59.886 A:middle
So UI sounds are things like

00:21:00.616 --> 00:21:03.306 A:middle
keyboard sounds, scrolling

00:21:03.306 --> 00:21:05.316 A:middle
sounds, pressing a button,

00:21:06.256 --> 00:21:09.076 A:middle
tapping, swiping, or any kind of

00:21:09.076 --> 00:21:09.996 A:middle
transitions.

00:21:10.646 --> 00:21:11.826 A:middle
Now I want to focus on three of

00:21:11.826 --> 00:21:14.506 A:middle
these and see how we approach

00:21:14.506 --> 00:21:15.816 A:middle
them in our own devices.

00:21:16.306 --> 00:21:18.406 A:middle

00:21:20.416 --> 00:21:22.376 A:middle
Now following our previous

00:21:22.836 --> 00:21:25.006 A:middle
design strategy, we may want to

00:21:25.006 --> 00:21:26.406 A:middle
start by recording some actual

00:21:26.406 --> 00:21:27.866 A:middle

Now, this rattles quite a bit,

00:21:37.606 --> 00:21:39.336 A:middle
but there's something satisfying

00:21:39.336 --> 00:21:40.626 A:middle
about the letters hitting the

00:22:00.056 --> 00:22:01.366 A:middle
So we can remember this when we

00:22:01.416 --> 00:22:03.816 A:middle
create our own sound for our iOS

00:22:05.476 --> 00:22:07.006 A:middle
We're designing for software, so

00:22:07.006 --> 00:22:08.806 A:middle
we can make it sound any way we

00:22:08.806 --> 00:22:09.156 A:middle
want.

00:22:09.866 --> 00:22:11.696 A:middle
For instance, we can change the

00:22:11.696 --> 00:22:14.306 A:middle
sound of the space bar, of the

00:22:14.306 --> 00:22:16.006 A:middle
modifier keys, and the backspace

00:22:16.006 --> 00:22:16.366 A:middle
keys.

00:22:17.496 --> 00:22:18.330 A:middle
Let's listen to it.

[ Popping sounds ]

00:22:31.066 --> 00:22:33.536 A:middle
So we create a character that is

00:22:33.536 --> 00:22:36.086 A:middle
a bit more playful and not so

00:22:36.086 --> 00:22:36.636 A:middle
static.

00:22:37.596 --> 00:22:39.186 A:middle
And we do another thing.

00:22:39.186 --> 00:22:41.226 A:middle
When you type faster, we bring

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:42.686 A:middle
down the volume of the sound

00:22:42.686 --> 00:22:43.686 A:middle
ever so slightly.

00:22:45.086 --> 00:22:46.176 A:middle
It's not something that you may

00:22:46.176 --> 00:22:48.256 A:middle
hear in everyday use, but even

00:22:48.256 --> 00:22:50.066 A:middle
these little things make a

00:22:50.066 --> 00:22:51.616 A:middle
difference in the experience.

00:22:52.006 --> 00:22:53.416 A:middle
Let's listen to it one more

00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:54.660 A:middle

[ Popping sounds ]

00:23:09.086 --> 00:23:12.656 A:middle
Okay, now next it's pressing a

00:23:12.656 --> 00:23:13.116 A:middle

00:23:13.496 --> 00:23:14.906 A:middle
For those of you with an iPhone

00:23:14.906 --> 00:23:17.636 A:middle

00:23:17.636 --> 00:23:18.376 A:middle
to your ear and click the Home

00:23:18.376 --> 00:23:18.976 A:middle

00:23:19.046 --> 00:23:20.186 A:middle
Go ahead.

00:23:22.406 --> 00:23:26.346 A:middle
What does it sound like?

00:23:26.346 --> 00:23:28.256 A:middle
Now since the iPhone 7, we have

00:23:28.256 --> 00:23:29.716 A:middle
a solid, safe Home button.

00:23:30.396 --> 00:23:31.506 A:middle
It's durable, and it's

00:23:31.506 --> 00:23:32.766 A:middle
waterproof, but it doesn't

00:23:32.766 --> 00:23:34.286 A:middle
actually move or make a "click"

00:23:34.286 --> 00:23:34.706 A:middle
sound.

00:23:35.426 --> 00:23:38.296 A:middle
So we used the Taptic Engine to

00:23:38.296 --> 00:23:40.426 A:middle
create this button experience,

00:23:41.416 --> 00:23:42.816 A:middle
and we learned while designing

00:23:42.816 --> 00:23:45.016 A:middle
for the watch that combining

00:23:45.016 --> 00:23:47.196 A:middle
sounds and haptics the right way

00:23:47.196 --> 00:23:48.716 A:middle
and synchronizing them

00:23:48.716 --> 00:23:50.416 A:middle
precisely, we can come up with

00:23:50.416 --> 00:23:52.746 A:middle
this great multisensory

00:23:52.746 --> 00:23:54.276 A:middle
experience, and we were looking

00:23:54.276 --> 00:23:55.386 A:middle
for a similar experience for

00:23:55.386 --> 00:23:58.416 A:middle
this button, so we decided to

00:23:58.416 --> 00:24:00.656 A:middle
add a very subtle, quiet "click"

00:24:00.656 --> 00:24:02.756 A:middle
sound to the tap of the Taptic

00:24:02.756 --> 00:24:04.596 A:middle

00:24:04.596 --> 00:24:05.656 A:middle
hear right now when you press

00:24:05.656 --> 00:24:05.746 A:middle
it.

00:24:06.266 --> 00:24:09.196 A:middle
And this also allowed us to

00:24:09.606 --> 00:24:11.326 A:middle
create multiple "click" fields.

00:24:11.646 --> 00:24:13.606 A:middle
So when you set up a new iPhone,

00:24:14.436 --> 00:24:15.456 A:middle
you can choose between two

00:24:15.456 --> 00:24:16.896 A:middle
different clicks.

00:24:17.716 --> 00:24:18.966 A:middle
There's one more thing that was

00:24:18.966 --> 00:24:20.686 A:middle
very interesting when we were

00:24:20.686 --> 00:24:21.816 A:middle
doing this exploration.

00:24:22.616 --> 00:24:24.386 A:middle
We found out that, if you take

00:24:24.386 --> 00:24:27.396 A:middle
one haptic tap, and you

00:24:27.396 --> 00:24:28.846 A:middle
synthesize it to a very sharp

00:24:28.846 --> 00:24:30.696 A:middle
and precise sound, like the one

00:24:30.696 --> 00:24:31.496 A:middle
on the left here.

00:24:31.496 --> 00:24:33.716 A:middle
It sounds like this.

[ Clicking sound ]

00:24:34.046 --> 00:24:35.686 A:middle
And people think that what they

00:24:35.686 --> 00:24:37.956 A:middle
feel is very precise and sharp

00:24:37.956 --> 00:24:40.566 A:middle
as well, but if we take exactly

00:24:40.566 --> 00:24:43.196 A:middle
the same tap, exactly the same,

00:24:43.196 --> 00:24:45.156 A:middle
we didn't change anything, and

00:24:46.056 --> 00:24:47.526 A:middle
synchronize it to another sound

00:24:47.526 --> 00:24:50.076 A:middle
like this [sound], then people

00:24:50.076 --> 00:24:51.486 A:middle
think that what they feel is

00:24:51.486 --> 00:24:52.286 A:middle
very different.

00:24:53.506 --> 00:24:54.536 A:middle
It's less sharp and less

00:24:55.266 --> 00:24:56.586 A:middle
So it's really interesting how

00:24:56.586 --> 00:24:58.526 A:middle
we can fool ourselves using

00:24:58.526 --> 00:25:00.046 A:middle
sound this way.

00:25:01.356 --> 00:25:02.896 A:middle
And lastly, let's look at

transitions.

00:25:05.206 --> 00:25:06.286 A:middle
These are the sounds that

00:25:06.286 --> 00:25:08.406 A:middle
accompany a movement between two

00:25:08.406 --> 00:25:10.816 A:middle
different states, like in the

00:25:10.816 --> 00:25:11.506 A:middle
Apple TV.

00:25:11.966 --> 00:25:14.456 A:middle
We're looking for two things

00:25:14.456 --> 00:25:15.016 A:middle
here.

00:25:15.016 --> 00:25:17.706 A:middle
A feeling of depth and a feeling

00:25:17.706 --> 00:25:18.386 A:middle
of movement.

00:25:19.446 --> 00:25:20.216 A:middle
Let's listen to it.

[ Transition sound ]

00:25:25.706 --> 00:25:28.466 A:middle
So the special character of this

00:25:28.466 --> 00:25:30.966 A:middle
sound emphasizes the feeling of

00:25:31.136 --> 00:25:34.036 A:middle
depth, and the envelope of the

00:25:34.036 --> 00:25:35.796 A:middle
sound is shaped in a way similar

00:25:35.796 --> 00:25:37.036 A:middle
to that of an object passing you

00:25:37.036 --> 00:25:38.626 A:middle
by, creating that feeling of

00:25:38.626 --> 00:25:39.156 A:middle
movement.

00:25:39.676 --> 00:25:41.196 A:middle
We could have used another sound

00:25:41.196 --> 00:25:42.516 A:middle
with similar characteristics,

00:25:42.516 --> 00:25:44.446 A:middle
but you really also want it to

00:25:44.446 --> 00:25:46.936 A:middle
match the aesthetic of the Apple

00:25:46.936 --> 00:25:48.536 A:middle
TV user interface perfectly.

00:25:48.726 --> 00:25:50.636 A:middle
We think this sound does the job

00:25:50.686 --> 00:25:51.216 A:middle
really well.

00:25:51.626 --> 00:25:53.596 A:middle
And there's also a sense of

00:25:53.596 --> 00:25:54.726 A:middle
direction, because we have two

00:25:54.726 --> 00:25:55.426 A:middle

of good UI sound design?

00:26:12.056 --> 00:26:14.176 A:middle
First off, it's used sparingly.

00:26:14.706 --> 00:26:16.116 A:middle
Really, again, try to find a

00:26:16.116 --> 00:26:18.066 A:middle
balance between no sound and too

00:26:18.066 --> 00:26:18.436 A:middle
much.

00:26:19.006 --> 00:26:20.096 A:middle
It's a delicate balance.

00:26:20.566 --> 00:26:23.956 A:middle
It has a much lower volume than

00:26:23.956 --> 00:26:25.076 A:middle
a notification sound, because

00:26:25.076 --> 00:26:26.186 A:middle
people have their phones in

00:26:26.186 --> 00:26:26.946 A:middle
their hands.

00:26:28.026 --> 00:26:29.906 A:middle
We can keep it very quiet.

00:26:30.296 --> 00:26:31.416 A:middle
We only want to add a very

00:26:31.416 --> 00:26:33.816 A:middle
subtle layer to the experience.

00:26:34.876 --> 00:26:37.696 A:middle
Now they help the users, and

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:40.126 A:middle
they delight the user by

00:26:40.126 --> 00:26:42.036 A:middle
creating this great visceral

00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:45.206 A:middle
and animation.

00:26:48.116 --> 00:26:51.456 A:middle
Now in this last section, I'd

00:26:51.456 --> 00:26:52.906 A:middle
like to give you some tips and

00:26:52.906 --> 00:26:55.036 A:middle
techniques to keep in mind when

00:26:55.036 --> 00:26:56.766 A:middle
you're working on your own app.

00:26:58.736 --> 00:27:01.956 A:middle
First of all, keep sound in mind

00:27:01.956 --> 00:27:02.686 A:middle
from the start.

00:27:03.516 --> 00:27:04.496 A:middle
When you're beginning your

00:27:04.496 --> 00:27:06.236 A:middle
project, you can ask yourself

00:27:06.236 --> 00:27:07.226 A:middle
these questions.

00:27:07.846 --> 00:27:09.026 A:middle
Will my app send frequent

00:27:09.026 --> 00:27:10.086 A:middle
notifications?

00:27:10.086 --> 00:27:11.916 A:middle
If this is the case, it makes a

00:27:11.916 --> 00:27:13.166 A:middle
lot of sense to think about

00:27:13.166 --> 00:27:14.406 A:middle
creating your own notification

00:27:14.406 --> 00:27:14.816 A:middle

00:27:16.456 --> 00:27:18.506 A:middle
Can sound play a role in my

00:27:18.506 --> 00:27:19.376 A:middle
app's branding?

00:27:20.156 --> 00:27:22.486 A:middle
Well, if the answer to the first

00:27:22.486 --> 00:27:25.366 A:middle
question is yes, and you do

00:27:25.366 --> 00:27:27.026 A:middle
create your own sound, then it's

00:27:27.056 --> 00:27:28.146 A:middle
already playing a role.

00:27:28.866 --> 00:27:31.026 A:middle
You're already creating a voice

00:27:31.026 --> 00:27:31.676 A:middle
for your brand.

00:27:34.046 --> 00:27:36.596 A:middle
Now how can the UI benefit from

00:27:36.596 --> 00:27:37.606 A:middle
an audible component?

00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:39.796 A:middle
Is there any way you can help

00:27:39.796 --> 00:27:40.926 A:middle

00:27:40.926 --> 00:27:42.296 A:middle
on on the screen by adding some

00:27:42.626 --> 00:27:44.406 A:middle
subtle sounds to it?

00:27:44.656 --> 00:27:47.296 A:middle
And then how would I understand

00:27:47.296 --> 00:27:48.766 A:middle
my app without a graphical user

interface?

00:27:50.076 --> 00:27:51.266 A:middle
The question I started out with.

00:27:51.266 --> 00:27:53.706 A:middle
Of course, you don't have to use

00:27:53.706 --> 00:27:55.036 A:middle
your app without looking at it,

00:27:55.326 --> 00:27:57.206 A:middle
but it's an interesting question

00:27:57.206 --> 00:27:58.216 A:middle
to help yourself, and it may

00:27:58.216 --> 00:27:59.826 A:middle

sound like a game.

00:29:11.096 --> 00:29:13.226 A:middle
Now if you do add UI sounds,

00:29:13.226 --> 00:29:14.636 A:middle
also add the option for people

00:29:14.636 --> 00:29:15.416 A:middle
to turn them off.

00:29:15.716 --> 00:29:17.626 A:middle
Now the last thing we want is

00:29:17.626 --> 00:29:19.576 A:middle
for people to always hit the

00:29:19.576 --> 00:29:21.396 A:middle
ringer switch, or even worst,

00:29:21.396 --> 00:29:22.586 A:middle
delete your app because they

00:29:22.586 --> 00:29:23.736 A:middle
don't like the way it sounds.

00:29:23.736 --> 00:29:25.586 A:middle
So be very careful when adding

00:29:25.586 --> 00:29:26.216 A:middle
these sounds.

00:29:26.216 --> 00:29:28.386 A:middle
And if you do, add the option

Here's some things to keep in

00:29:42.036 --> 00:29:43.796 A:middle
mind, especially when designing

00:29:43.796 --> 00:29:45.676 A:middle
for a device like the iPhone.

00:29:46.276 --> 00:29:49.266 A:middle
If I'm listening to music, and

00:29:49.266 --> 00:29:50.516 A:middle
your notification sound comes

00:29:50.516 --> 00:29:53.446 A:middle
in, the music ducks, which is

00:29:53.446 --> 00:29:54.886 A:middle
fine because I choose to get

00:29:54.886 --> 00:29:55.916 A:middle
these notifications.

00:29:55.916 --> 00:29:57.056 A:middle
They give me information.

00:29:58.276 --> 00:29:59.806 A:middle
But if your notification sound

00:29:59.806 --> 00:30:02.036 A:middle
is too long, it ducks for a very

00:30:02.036 --> 00:30:03.816 A:middle
long time, so it becomes

00:30:03.816 --> 00:30:03.976 A:middle
annoying.

00:30:05.596 --> 00:30:06.826 A:middle
So ask yourself the question,

00:30:07.316 --> 00:30:08.356 A:middle
does it get in the way of the

00:30:08.356 --> 00:30:09.516 A:middle
user in any way?

00:30:10.096 --> 00:30:13.266 A:middle
We all know how frustrating it

00:30:13.266 --> 00:30:14.696 A:middle
is if you're watching a video,

uneasy feeling that something is

00:30:26.516 --> 00:30:28.766 A:middle
not right here, and it's so much

00:30:28.766 --> 00:30:30.776 A:middle
more satisfying when everything

00:30:54.856 --> 00:30:57.006 A:middle
difference in the experience, so

00:31:35.136 --> 00:31:36.636 A:middle
The actual sound starts here.

And then I don't know if you

00:31:37.906 --> 00:31:39.366 A:middle

And then the sound was truncated

00:31:45.306 --> 00:31:46.676 A:middle
