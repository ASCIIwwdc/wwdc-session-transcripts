00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:25.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello everybody.

00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:27.036 A:middle
My name is Cas Lemmens.

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:28.556 A:middle
I'm a designer here at Apple,

00:00:29.026 --> 00:00:30.696 A:middle
and I'm delighted to see that so

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:31.616 A:middle
many people have showed up to

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:32.856 A:middle
talk about designing across

00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:33.316 A:middle
platforms.

00:00:33.586 --> 00:00:35.076 A:middle
It's a pretty amazing view from

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:35.296 A:middle
here.

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:36.456 A:middle
I wish you could see it.

00:00:37.146 --> 00:00:40.296 A:middle
Alright. At Apple, we're really

00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:41.466 A:middle
proud of the platforms that we

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:41.816 A:middle
create.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.286 A:middle
For every platform that we've

00:00:43.336 --> 00:00:44.706 A:middle
created, and for every time we

00:00:44.706 --> 00:00:47.126 A:middle
update a platform, we aim to

00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:48.246 A:middle
improve your day-to-day life,

00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:49.676 A:middle
and hopefully create a

00:00:49.676 --> 00:00:51.266 A:middle
meaningful relationship between

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.336 A:middle
the platform and you.

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:54.726 A:middle
And that relationship doesn't

00:00:54.726 --> 00:00:56.096 A:middle
have to extend to just one

00:00:56.096 --> 00:00:56.626 A:middle
platform.

00:00:57.476 --> 00:00:58.826 A:middle
The more Apple products you use,

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.376 A:middle
the more you rely on not just

00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:02.006 A:middle
single platforms, but on the

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:03.306 A:middle
entire ecosystem.

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:06.236 A:middle
You might start your day with a

00:01:06.236 --> 00:01:07.136 A:middle
run on your Watch.

00:01:08.096 --> 00:01:09.166 A:middle
At work, you might be using a

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.326 A:middle
MacBook or an iMac.

00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:12.366 A:middle
When you head home, you might

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.836 A:middle
look up public transportation on

00:01:13.836 --> 00:01:15.716 A:middle
your phone, or use CarPlay in

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:16.176 A:middle
the car.

00:01:17.326 --> 00:01:18.186 A:middle
When you're at home, you might

00:01:18.186 --> 00:01:20.026 A:middle
unwind watching a TV show or a

00:01:20.026 --> 00:01:22.066 A:middle
movie on the Apple TV, and at

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.336 A:middle
the end of the day, you might

00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:24.806 A:middle
finish a book on your iPad.

00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:28.206 A:middle
Regardless of the device you're

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:30.936 A:middle
using, you can rely on Apple's

00:01:30.936 --> 00:01:33.036 A:middle
ecosystem to recognize you, to

00:01:33.036 --> 00:01:34.956 A:middle
understand you, and to help you.

00:01:37.026 --> 00:01:38.346 A:middle
Creating and contributing to

00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:39.836 A:middle
this ecosystem requires a very

00:01:39.836 --> 00:01:41.086 A:middle
deep understanding of every

00:01:41.086 --> 00:01:41.796 A:middle
single platform.

00:01:42.846 --> 00:01:44.486 A:middle
As a designer at Apple, that's a

00:01:44.486 --> 00:01:45.666 A:middle
very familiar challenge.

00:01:46.546 --> 00:01:47.526 A:middle
For every app that Apple

00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:49.336 A:middle
creates, we carefully consider

00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:50.546 A:middle
on which platforms it should

00:01:50.546 --> 00:01:52.216 A:middle
live, and how it should scale

00:01:52.216 --> 00:01:52.676 A:middle
between them.

00:01:54.286 --> 00:01:55.236 A:middle
If you look at the apps that

00:01:55.236 --> 00:01:56.646 A:middle
Apple creates, you might notice

00:01:56.646 --> 00:01:58.366 A:middle
that some of them live on all of

00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:01.006 A:middle
our platforms, like Photos, or

00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:01.306 A:middle
Music.

00:02:02.526 --> 00:02:04.456 A:middle
Others only exist on a few, like

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:09.736 A:middle
Notes, or Mail, or TV.

00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:12.666 A:middle
Some of our services work really

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:13.836 A:middle
well if you have more than one

00:02:13.836 --> 00:02:15.336 A:middle
device, like ApplePay.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:18.986 A:middle
And, others work only if you

00:02:18.986 --> 00:02:20.496 A:middle
have multiple devices available

00:02:20.696 --> 00:02:22.656 A:middle
at the same time, like FaceTime.

00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:26.526 A:middle
Today we're going to talk about

00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:28.276 A:middle
a process that we use at Apple

00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:29.686 A:middle
that can help you design across

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:30.206 A:middle
platforms.

00:02:31.146 --> 00:02:32.556 A:middle
The goal is to efficiently, but

00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:34.676 A:middle
purposefully, bring your apps to

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:35.416 A:middle
more platforms.

00:02:36.796 --> 00:02:37.426 A:middle
We're going to start with

00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:37.916 A:middle
selecting.

00:02:38.396 --> 00:02:39.366 A:middle
We're going to look at the

00:02:39.476 --> 00:02:40.876 A:middle
capabilities and the context of

00:02:40.876 --> 00:02:42.376 A:middle
each platform, and make our

00:02:42.376 --> 00:02:43.206 A:middle
decision based on that

00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:43.796 A:middle
information.

00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:46.426 A:middle
Then, we going to adapt.

00:02:47.036 --> 00:02:47.936 A:middle
We're going to look at all the

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:49.136 A:middle
features and functionality we

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:50.306 A:middle
want to bring to our platforms

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:52.046 A:middle
and manage that.

00:02:53.336 --> 00:02:54.416 A:middle
Then, we conform.

00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:56.176 A:middle
We try to find a balance between

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.546 A:middle
our own brand and the platform

00:02:57.546 --> 00:02:59.146 A:middle
guidelines, and to find our look

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:01.566 A:middle
and feel on them.

00:03:01.816 --> 00:03:02.386 A:middle
Then, we connect.

00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:04.096 A:middle
We see what happens when you go

00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:05.376 A:middle
from one platform to another,

00:03:05.726 --> 00:03:06.676 A:middle
and how it can make that

00:03:06.676 --> 00:03:08.056 A:middle
experience seamless and

00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:08.446 A:middle
effortless.

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:11.586 A:middle
And, lastly, if possible, we try

00:03:11.586 --> 00:03:12.166 A:middle
to extend.

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:14.456 A:middle
We see what can happen when

00:03:14.516 --> 00:03:15.736 A:middle
multiple platforms become

00:03:15.736 --> 00:03:17.336 A:middle
available at the same time.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:20.996 A:middle
That's the entire process, and

00:03:20.996 --> 00:03:22.316 A:middle
hopefully, at the end of this

00:03:22.316 --> 00:03:23.246 A:middle
talk, you will have all the

00:03:23.246 --> 00:03:24.406 A:middle
required information and

00:03:24.406 --> 00:03:26.066 A:middle
knowledge that you need to make

00:03:26.066 --> 00:03:28.376 A:middle
your apps work amazing in

00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:29.306 A:middle
Apple's ecosystem.

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:30.826 A:middle
So, let's dig right in.

00:03:30.826 --> 00:03:31.756 A:middle
Let's start with selecting.

00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:34.776 A:middle
When we talk about selecting, we

00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:35.506 A:middle
really want to answer the

00:03:35.506 --> 00:03:37.376 A:middle
question, "What platform do I go

00:03:37.376 --> 00:03:37.636 A:middle
to?"

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:39.746 A:middle
Maybe you haven't launched your

00:03:39.746 --> 00:03:40.826 A:middle
app yet, and you're trying to

00:03:40.826 --> 00:03:42.496 A:middle
decide what your first platform

00:03:42.496 --> 00:03:42.836 A:middle
will be.

00:03:43.546 --> 00:03:45.056 A:middle
Or, maybe, you have launched

00:03:45.056 --> 00:03:46.036 A:middle
your app on one or two

00:03:46.036 --> 00:03:47.266 A:middle
platforms, and you're trying to

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:48.686 A:middle
decide where to go next.

00:03:50.326 --> 00:03:51.446 A:middle
Two words come to mind that are

00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:52.976 A:middle
really important when we talk

00:03:52.976 --> 00:03:54.226 A:middle
about selecting a platform.

00:03:55.116 --> 00:03:56.396 A:middle
Context and capabilities.

00:03:57.156 --> 00:03:58.826 A:middle
Context is the time, the place,

00:03:58.826 --> 00:04:00.256 A:middle
and the environment in which

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:01.446 A:middle
your platform really comes

00:04:01.446 --> 00:04:01.746 A:middle
alive.

00:04:02.746 --> 00:04:04.206 A:middle
And, capabilities are the unique

00:04:04.256 --> 00:04:05.846 A:middle
functionality that makes the

00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:06.956 A:middle
platform distinct from all the

00:04:06.956 --> 00:04:07.366 A:middle
other ones.

00:04:08.316 --> 00:04:09.216 A:middle
It's really important to

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:10.856 A:middle
understand context, as when

00:04:10.856 --> 00:04:12.436 A:middle
people switch context, they

00:04:12.436 --> 00:04:13.536 A:middle
often switch platform.

00:04:14.396 --> 00:04:15.286 A:middle
I'll give you an example.

00:04:15.786 --> 00:04:16.606 A:middle
Let's say that you're working

00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:18.046 A:middle
behind a desk at school or in

00:04:18.046 --> 00:04:18.506 A:middle
the office.

00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:20.756 A:middle
That's a very focused and

00:04:20.756 --> 00:04:22.246 A:middle
stationary context that you're

00:04:22.246 --> 00:04:22.376 A:middle
in.

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:24.096 A:middle
When you then leave that place,

00:04:24.096 --> 00:04:26.116 A:middle
and let's say you go to a bus or

00:04:26.116 --> 00:04:27.516 A:middle
a train to head home, that

00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:29.806 A:middle
becomes a very dynamic and

00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:31.016 A:middle
mobile platform.

00:04:31.916 --> 00:04:33.456 A:middle
And, mobile context, sorry.

00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:35.606 A:middle
That's a very big switch in

00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:36.586 A:middle
context, from being very

00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:38.226 A:middle
stationary and focused to being

00:04:38.226 --> 00:04:39.366 A:middle
very mobile and public.

00:04:39.776 --> 00:04:40.986 A:middle
And, that also explains why

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:42.236 A:middle
people would switch device.

00:04:42.346 --> 00:04:43.836 A:middle
They go from a MacBook or an

00:04:43.956 --> 00:04:45.836 A:middle
iMac, to maybe a phone or Watch.

00:04:46.266 --> 00:04:47.296 A:middle
And, that's because a phone and

00:04:47.296 --> 00:04:49.416 A:middle
a Watch is better optimized for

00:04:50.226 --> 00:04:51.206 A:middle
that context.

00:04:51.266 --> 00:04:52.616 A:middle
Understanding capabilities is

00:04:52.616 --> 00:04:54.366 A:middle
equally important, as they

00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:55.866 A:middle
really allow you to see what

00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:57.636 A:middle
makes a platform unique, and how

00:04:57.636 --> 00:04:59.036 A:middle
your app can benefit from that

00:04:59.036 --> 00:04:59.576 A:middle
capability.

00:05:00.136 --> 00:05:02.696 A:middle
I'll give you a few examples to

00:05:02.696 --> 00:05:03.346 A:middle
show you what I mean.

00:05:03.976 --> 00:05:05.426 A:middle
Let's start with the iPhone.

00:05:06.176 --> 00:05:07.656 A:middle
Maybe the most familiar platform

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:08.626 A:middle
amongst all of us here.

00:05:09.606 --> 00:05:11.106 A:middle
If you look at the context of

00:05:11.106 --> 00:05:13.336 A:middle
the iPhone, it's always on, it's

00:05:13.336 --> 00:05:14.656 A:middle
always with you, and therefore

00:05:14.656 --> 00:05:15.246 A:middle
it's mobile.

00:05:15.496 --> 00:05:17.406 A:middle
It's a very personal and private

00:05:17.406 --> 00:05:17.936 A:middle
device.

00:05:17.936 --> 00:05:18.956 A:middle
You wouldn't easily share it

00:05:18.956 --> 00:05:20.946 A:middle
with other people, and it's all

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:22.156 A:middle
optimized for quite short

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:22.836 A:middle
engagements.

00:05:23.146 --> 00:05:24.276 A:middle
Often when you use the iPhone,

00:05:24.276 --> 00:05:25.356 A:middle
you maybe use it for a couple of

00:05:25.356 --> 00:05:26.476 A:middle
minutes, not more.

00:05:27.616 --> 00:05:28.936 A:middle
The capabilities support the

00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:29.446 A:middle
context.

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:31.516 A:middle
Because the phone is always on

00:05:31.516 --> 00:05:33.036 A:middle
and always with you, it's very

00:05:33.036 --> 00:05:33.806 A:middle
environment aware.

00:05:34.176 --> 00:05:35.256 A:middle
It has a gyroscope, an

00:05:35.256 --> 00:05:37.016 A:middle
accelerometer, and all that

00:05:37.016 --> 00:05:38.806 A:middle
information is accessible with

00:05:38.806 --> 00:05:40.266 A:middle
background processes even when

00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:41.266 A:middle
you're not using the iPhone.

00:05:42.626 --> 00:05:43.916 A:middle
Because your phone is personal

00:05:43.916 --> 00:05:45.536 A:middle
and private, it's protected with

00:05:45.536 --> 00:05:45.926 A:middle
Touch ID.

00:05:46.896 --> 00:05:47.606 A:middle
And, to make those short

00:05:47.606 --> 00:05:49.066 A:middle
engagements really easy and fun,

00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:50.856 A:middle
you have a very detailed touch

00:05:52.816 --> 00:05:52.966 A:middle
screen.

00:05:53.756 --> 00:05:55.076 A:middle
The Watch is quite similar.

00:05:55.876 --> 00:05:57.936 A:middle
It's also always on and with

00:05:57.936 --> 00:05:58.156 A:middle
you.

00:05:58.596 --> 00:05:59.856 A:middle
It's also personal and private,

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:02.256 A:middle
but it's much more instant, and

00:06:02.256 --> 00:06:03.596 A:middle
much more optimized for very

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:04.516 A:middle
short interactions.

00:06:05.286 --> 00:06:06.666 A:middle
A Watch face, for example, gives

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.276 A:middle
you the right information just

00:06:08.276 --> 00:06:09.756 A:middle
by looking at your Watch.

00:06:10.426 --> 00:06:11.856 A:middle
And, notifications just show you

00:06:11.856 --> 00:06:13.106 A:middle
more just by looking long

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:13.306 A:middle
enough.

00:06:14.656 --> 00:06:15.996 A:middle
The capabilities, again, support

00:06:15.996 --> 00:06:18.116 A:middle
it, because the Watch is so

00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:19.426 A:middle
personal it can track your

00:06:19.426 --> 00:06:20.646 A:middle
movement, it can track your

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.096 A:middle
heart, even your location.

00:06:23.046 --> 00:06:24.116 A:middle
The haptics can tell you when

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:25.266 A:middle
you should look at your Watch,

00:06:25.636 --> 00:06:26.906 A:middle
and the Watch faces allow you to

00:06:26.956 --> 00:06:28.306 A:middle
customize the information you

00:06:28.306 --> 00:06:29.756 A:middle
want to see at a glance.

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:32.436 A:middle
Let's look at the iPad.

00:06:32.816 --> 00:06:33.986 A:middle
The iPad has a very mixed

00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:34.576 A:middle
context.

00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:36.476 A:middle
You can use it both at home and

00:06:36.476 --> 00:06:36.926 A:middle
on the go.

00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:38.916 A:middle
You can do very precise and

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:40.686 A:middle
focused work on it, or just use

00:06:40.686 --> 00:06:42.216 A:middle
it as a lean back device, for

00:06:42.306 --> 00:06:44.256 A:middle
watching movies, TV shows, or

00:06:44.256 --> 00:06:44.876 A:middle
playing games.

00:06:45.836 --> 00:06:46.936 A:middle
And, all of those are longer

00:06:46.936 --> 00:06:48.906 A:middle
engagements than the phone or

00:06:49.636 --> 00:06:51.216 A:middle
the Watch.

00:06:51.406 --> 00:06:52.686 A:middle
The large screen really supports

00:06:52.686 --> 00:06:54.756 A:middle
the context, because it allows

00:06:54.756 --> 00:06:56.006 A:middle
you to do all that precise and

00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:56.646 A:middle
focused work.

00:06:57.186 --> 00:06:58.566 A:middle
The ambient light sensor allows

00:06:58.566 --> 00:06:59.706 A:middle
you to use the iPad both in the

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:00.956 A:middle
evening and during the day.

00:07:00.956 --> 00:07:03.086 A:middle
The high-fidelity speakers allow

00:07:03.086 --> 00:07:04.696 A:middle
you to create a very immersive

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:06.036 A:middle
experience with games and

00:07:06.036 --> 00:07:07.926 A:middle
movies, and you have that same

00:07:07.926 --> 00:07:09.366 A:middle
touch screen as on the phone.

00:07:10.366 --> 00:07:11.486 A:middle
And, if you add a pencil to it,

00:07:11.486 --> 00:07:12.456 A:middle
well then it becomes a very

00:07:12.516 --> 00:07:13.476 A:middle
precise interaction.

00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:16.966 A:middle
Let's look at the MacBook.

00:07:17.516 --> 00:07:18.576 A:middle
The context of the MacBook is

00:07:18.576 --> 00:07:19.716 A:middle
always in a very professional

00:07:19.716 --> 00:07:20.266 A:middle
environment.

00:07:20.756 --> 00:07:22.046 A:middle
You can do very precise and

00:07:22.046 --> 00:07:23.566 A:middle
complex work on a MacBook which

00:07:23.566 --> 00:07:24.356 A:middle
is why it's the preferred

00:07:24.416 --> 00:07:26.456 A:middle
platform to design apps or to

00:07:26.456 --> 00:07:26.956 A:middle
develop them.

00:07:28.036 --> 00:07:29.136 A:middle
It can be used as a shared

00:07:29.136 --> 00:07:31.056 A:middle
device, but it's always personal

00:07:31.056 --> 00:07:32.036 A:middle
as everybody has their own

00:07:32.036 --> 00:07:32.386 A:middle
account.

00:07:33.626 --> 00:07:34.816 A:middle
And, you use the MacBook or the

00:07:34.866 --> 00:07:36.486 A:middle
iMac for very long engagements.

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:38.106 A:middle
Most of us here would probably

00:07:38.106 --> 00:07:39.836 A:middle
be using a MacBook or an iMac

00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:41.146 A:middle
several hours a day.

00:07:41.146 --> 00:07:43.806 A:middle
Let's look at the capabilities.

00:07:44.316 --> 00:07:45.656 A:middle
To do all that professional

00:07:46.206 --> 00:07:47.836 A:middle
work, it has a very high

00:07:47.836 --> 00:07:48.526 A:middle
performance.

00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:50.186 A:middle
The keyboard and mouse allow you

00:07:50.186 --> 00:07:51.566 A:middle
to do very precise and complex

00:07:51.566 --> 00:07:51.886 A:middle
work.

00:07:52.516 --> 00:07:53.956 A:middle
Multitasking allows you to do

00:07:53.956 --> 00:07:55.416 A:middle
exactly what you want to do, how

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:56.086 A:middle
you want to do it.

00:07:57.216 --> 00:07:58.566 A:middle
And, multi users allow you to

00:07:58.566 --> 00:08:00.056 A:middle
make the MacBook or the iMac a

00:08:00.056 --> 00:08:01.666 A:middle
shared device, but still very

00:08:01.726 --> 00:08:02.096 A:middle
personal.

00:08:02.666 --> 00:08:05.086 A:middle
And lastly, let's look at the

00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:05.656 A:middle
Apple TV.

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:08.226 A:middle
The Apple TV is a shared device.

00:08:08.686 --> 00:08:09.556 A:middle
You use it together with your

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:10.506 A:middle
family or your friends.

00:08:11.036 --> 00:08:11.896 A:middle
It's stationary.

00:08:11.976 --> 00:08:13.286 A:middle
You lock it to your TV and it

00:08:13.286 --> 00:08:14.316 A:middle
doesn't really move from that

00:08:14.316 --> 00:08:14.866 A:middle
location.

00:08:15.586 --> 00:08:16.836 A:middle
And, it's completely optimized

00:08:16.836 --> 00:08:17.956 A:middle
for a lean back experience.

00:08:18.446 --> 00:08:20.176 A:middle
You can Watch movies, TV shows,

00:08:20.176 --> 00:08:20.726 A:middle
or play games.

00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:22.376 A:middle
And, again, all of those are

00:08:22.376 --> 00:08:24.146 A:middle
longer engagements, often 30

00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:25.866 A:middle
minutes, to maybe a few hours.

00:08:27.536 --> 00:08:28.866 A:middle
It works really well with an HD

00:08:28.866 --> 00:08:30.206 A:middle
display to make the content

00:08:30.206 --> 00:08:31.016 A:middle
really come alive.

00:08:31.736 --> 00:08:33.116 A:middle
The remote control is light and

00:08:33.116 --> 00:08:34.286 A:middle
easy, and you can just pass it

00:08:34.286 --> 00:08:35.126 A:middle
around to your friends and

00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:35.576 A:middle
family.

00:08:36.366 --> 00:08:37.546 A:middle
Because it's stationary it's

00:08:37.546 --> 00:08:39.146 A:middle
very home aware, which is why it

00:08:39.146 --> 00:08:41.106 A:middle
works so well with HomeKit, and

00:08:41.106 --> 00:08:42.416 A:middle
it's completely optimized for a

00:08:42.476 --> 00:08:43.966 A:middle
10-foot distance, so you can

00:08:43.966 --> 00:08:44.926 A:middle
really just sit back on the

00:08:44.926 --> 00:08:46.556 A:middle
couch, relax, and enjoy the

00:08:46.556 --> 00:08:46.826 A:middle
show.

00:08:47.416 --> 00:08:50.856 A:middle
So, you see that understanding

00:08:50.856 --> 00:08:52.156 A:middle
the context and the capabilities

00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:53.556 A:middle
of each platform is really

00:08:53.556 --> 00:08:55.296 A:middle
important to help you choose

00:08:55.296 --> 00:08:56.386 A:middle
what platform to go to.

00:08:57.306 --> 00:08:58.416 A:middle
The context is where it comes

00:08:58.416 --> 00:09:00.616 A:middle
alive, and the capabilities is

00:09:00.616 --> 00:09:01.366 A:middle
what makes it unique.

00:09:02.586 --> 00:09:03.736 A:middle
And, the same goes for your app,

00:09:04.236 --> 00:09:05.076 A:middle
so you might want to ask

00:09:05.076 --> 00:09:07.066 A:middle
yourself, in what context does

00:09:07.066 --> 00:09:08.346 A:middle
my app really come alive?

00:09:09.186 --> 00:09:10.386 A:middle
And, what are the capabilities

00:09:10.386 --> 00:09:11.606 A:middle
it requires to do so?

00:09:12.896 --> 00:09:15.026 A:middle
At Apple, we have a simple

00:09:15.026 --> 00:09:16.466 A:middle
exercise we like to do a couple

00:09:16.466 --> 00:09:17.586 A:middle
of times when we're trying to

00:09:17.586 --> 00:09:19.486 A:middle
choose on which platforms an app

00:09:19.486 --> 00:09:20.406 A:middle
should be available on.

00:09:21.226 --> 00:09:21.856 A:middle
And, I'll give you a few

00:09:21.856 --> 00:09:22.876 A:middle
examples to show you what I

00:09:22.876 --> 00:09:23.086 A:middle
mean.

00:09:23.976 --> 00:09:25.016 A:middle
Let's look at Activity.

00:09:25.726 --> 00:09:26.996 A:middle
If you think about the

00:09:26.996 --> 00:09:28.366 A:middle
characteristics of Activity,

00:09:28.366 --> 00:09:30.306 A:middle
well, it has to be mobile.

00:09:30.876 --> 00:09:32.026 A:middle
Activity tracks your data --

00:09:32.416 --> 00:09:33.836 A:middle
tracks your movement the whole

00:09:33.836 --> 00:09:35.386 A:middle
day, so to give you accurate

00:09:35.386 --> 00:09:36.926 A:middle
data, it has to be always on,

00:09:37.016 --> 00:09:38.406 A:middle
always with you, and therefore,

00:09:38.516 --> 00:09:38.876 A:middle
mobile.

00:09:40.176 --> 00:09:41.486 A:middle
It also has to be personal.

00:09:41.946 --> 00:09:43.096 A:middle
It should be able to track your

00:09:43.096 --> 00:09:44.586 A:middle
data and only your data.

00:09:45.816 --> 00:09:46.846 A:middle
So, when you look at these two

00:09:46.846 --> 00:09:48.226 A:middle
characteristics, what we do, is

00:09:48.606 --> 00:09:49.286 A:middle
we map them out.

00:09:49.496 --> 00:09:50.676 A:middle
We try to put them on a scale.

00:09:51.606 --> 00:09:52.656 A:middle
For example, if we look at

00:09:52.656 --> 00:09:54.776 A:middle
mobile, we can map that out on a

00:09:54.776 --> 00:09:56.756 A:middle
scale from mobile to stationary.

00:09:57.876 --> 00:09:58.666 A:middle
If you look all of your

00:09:58.736 --> 00:10:00.466 A:middle
platforms on this scale, they

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:01.616 A:middle
would lay out like this.

00:10:02.786 --> 00:10:03.926 A:middle
The Watch is the most mobile

00:10:03.926 --> 00:10:05.756 A:middle
platform we have, the TV as we

00:10:05.756 --> 00:10:07.206 A:middle
said before, is the most

00:10:07.206 --> 00:10:07.726 A:middle
stationary.

00:10:08.936 --> 00:10:09.896 A:middle
If you look at the other

00:10:09.896 --> 00:10:11.986 A:middle
characteristic, personal, we can

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:13.296 A:middle
map it out on a scale from

00:10:13.296 --> 00:10:15.356 A:middle
personal to shared, and we get

00:10:15.356 --> 00:10:15.956 A:middle
something like this.

00:10:16.936 --> 00:10:18.226 A:middle
The Watch is the most personal

00:10:18.226 --> 00:10:19.426 A:middle
and mobile platform we have.

00:10:20.076 --> 00:10:21.706 A:middle
The TV is the most stationary

00:10:21.706 --> 00:10:22.866 A:middle
and shared.

00:10:23.696 --> 00:10:25.026 A:middle
When we looked at Activity, we

00:10:25.026 --> 00:10:25.976 A:middle
said, well it had to be

00:10:25.976 --> 00:10:27.646 A:middle
personal, and it had to be

00:10:27.646 --> 00:10:28.026 A:middle
mobile.

00:10:29.106 --> 00:10:30.796 A:middle
So on this chart, it's probably

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.026 A:middle
located somewhere here.

00:10:33.406 --> 00:10:34.736 A:middle
And, that explains why Activity

00:10:34.736 --> 00:10:36.396 A:middle
is available on these platforms,

00:10:37.106 --> 00:10:40.836 A:middle
and not on any other.

00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:42.026 A:middle
I'll show you another example,

00:10:42.026 --> 00:10:43.376 A:middle
let's look at GarageBand.

00:10:44.866 --> 00:10:45.636 A:middle
The characteristics of

00:10:45.636 --> 00:10:46.926 A:middle
GarageBand is that you have to

00:10:46.926 --> 00:10:48.396 A:middle
be able to be really precise.

00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:50.256 A:middle
You want to be able to

00:10:50.256 --> 00:10:52.136 A:middle
manipulate sound exactly where

00:10:52.136 --> 00:10:53.346 A:middle
and when you want it.

00:10:54.456 --> 00:10:56.116 A:middle
And, secondly, it has to work

00:10:56.266 --> 00:10:57.126 A:middle
with multitasking.

00:10:57.716 --> 00:10:58.906 A:middle
You need to be able to play

00:10:58.906 --> 00:11:00.456 A:middle
multiple sounds at the same time

00:11:00.886 --> 00:11:01.716 A:middle
and it needs to be able to

00:11:01.716 --> 00:11:02.986 A:middle
handle all the hardware and

00:11:02.986 --> 00:11:04.306 A:middle
instruments that you might

00:11:04.306 --> 00:11:05.346 A:middle
attach to the platform.

00:11:06.646 --> 00:11:07.836 A:middle
So, again, we can map this out.

00:11:08.856 --> 00:11:09.786 A:middle
Let's look at precise.

00:11:10.696 --> 00:11:12.346 A:middle
We can map that out on a scale

00:11:12.656 --> 00:11:14.126 A:middle
from loose interactions to

00:11:14.126 --> 00:11:15.046 A:middle
precise interactions.

00:11:16.116 --> 00:11:17.356 A:middle
The platforms lay out like this.

00:11:18.206 --> 00:11:19.546 A:middle
On a MacBook with a keyboard and

00:11:19.546 --> 00:11:21.056 A:middle
a mouse, you can be really

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.576 A:middle
precise, but on a Watch, it's a

00:11:23.576 --> 00:11:25.086 A:middle
very small screen and as

00:11:25.086 --> 00:11:26.796 A:middle
everybody has fat fingers, you

00:11:26.796 --> 00:11:27.826 A:middle
might not be able to be that

00:11:27.826 --> 00:11:28.226 A:middle
precise.

00:11:29.416 --> 00:11:30.526 A:middle
If you look at the other scale

00:11:30.526 --> 00:11:32.456 A:middle
of multitasking, we can map that

00:11:32.456 --> 00:11:33.276 A:middle
out on the scale from

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:34.886 A:middle
multitasking to a single task.

00:11:35.726 --> 00:11:37.256 A:middle
On a MacBook, you can easily do

00:11:37.256 --> 00:11:38.916 A:middle
multiple tasks at the same time.

00:11:39.496 --> 00:11:41.106 A:middle
On a Watch, you can only do one

00:11:41.176 --> 00:11:42.416 A:middle
single task at a time.

00:11:43.006 --> 00:11:45.246 A:middle
If you look at GarageBand to be

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:46.366 A:middle
set, it had to support

00:11:46.366 --> 00:11:48.296 A:middle
multitasking and it had to be

00:11:48.296 --> 00:11:50.446 A:middle
very precise, so it's located

00:11:50.446 --> 00:11:52.046 A:middle
somewhere here, and that

00:11:52.046 --> 00:11:53.446 A:middle
explains why it's available on

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:55.746 A:middle
these three platforms, and not

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:56.276 A:middle
on any other.

00:11:57.466 --> 00:11:58.996 A:middle
This is just a very simple

00:11:58.996 --> 00:12:00.606 A:middle
example, two simple examples

00:12:00.606 --> 00:12:02.926 A:middle
actually of using these

00:12:02.966 --> 00:12:04.166 A:middle
characteristics to choose your

00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:04.586 A:middle
platform.

00:12:05.056 --> 00:12:06.576 A:middle
We do this exercise over and

00:12:06.576 --> 00:12:07.746 A:middle
over again with tons of

00:12:07.796 --> 00:12:09.586 A:middle
characteristics, and in the end,

00:12:09.586 --> 00:12:11.336 A:middle
we hope that we can find a few

00:12:11.336 --> 00:12:12.856 A:middle
platforms on which your app can

00:12:12.856 --> 00:12:13.726 A:middle
really come alive.

00:12:14.406 --> 00:12:16.636 A:middle
And that's exactly what

00:12:16.636 --> 00:12:17.546 A:middle
selecting is all about.

00:12:17.546 --> 00:12:20.026 A:middle
It is choosing a platform based

00:12:20.026 --> 00:12:21.866 A:middle
on the context it supports, and

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.096 A:middle
the capabilities it provides,

00:12:24.216 --> 00:12:25.386 A:middle
and it's validating where your

00:12:25.386 --> 00:12:26.906 A:middle
app can benefit the most.

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:31.236 A:middle
So, that was step one.

00:12:31.896 --> 00:12:33.416 A:middle
We looked at what platform we

00:12:33.416 --> 00:12:34.146 A:middle
wanted to go to.

00:12:34.726 --> 00:12:36.006 A:middle
Now, we're going to go and look

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:36.626 A:middle
at adapting.

00:12:37.666 --> 00:12:38.436 A:middle
With adapting, we're going to

00:12:38.436 --> 00:12:39.796 A:middle
look at all the interactions,

00:12:39.796 --> 00:12:41.206 A:middle
all the features, all the

00:12:41.206 --> 00:12:42.396 A:middle
functionality we want to bring

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:44.096 A:middle
to our app, and try to manage

00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:45.826 A:middle
that across the platforms that

00:12:45.826 --> 00:12:46.776 A:middle
we want to be available on.

00:12:47.966 --> 00:12:49.136 A:middle
I'll explain, again with an

00:12:49.136 --> 00:12:49.616 A:middle
example.

00:12:50.056 --> 00:12:51.946 A:middle
Let's look at Activity on the

00:12:51.996 --> 00:12:52.226 A:middle
iPhone.

00:12:53.136 --> 00:12:54.306 A:middle
Activity on the iPhone, you can

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:56.276 A:middle
do a whole range of features.

00:12:56.786 --> 00:12:58.916 A:middle
You can look at your progress of

00:12:59.026 --> 00:13:00.186 A:middle
today, you can look at your

00:13:00.186 --> 00:13:02.406 A:middle
achievements, your workouts, you

00:13:02.406 --> 00:13:03.316 A:middle
can see how your friends are

00:13:03.316 --> 00:13:03.716 A:middle
doing.

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:05.256 A:middle
And, you can manage all that

00:13:05.256 --> 00:13:05.496 A:middle
data.

00:13:05.686 --> 00:13:07.116 A:middle
You can add workouts, you can

00:13:07.116 --> 00:13:09.016 A:middle
invite friends, you can share

00:13:09.016 --> 00:13:10.636 A:middle
the achievements, you can share

00:13:10.636 --> 00:13:11.006 A:middle
progress.

00:13:11.766 --> 00:13:13.146 A:middle
All of that is possible on the

00:13:13.186 --> 00:13:15.166 A:middle
iPhone, and that works well if

00:13:15.166 --> 00:13:16.636 A:middle
you think back about the context

00:13:16.636 --> 00:13:17.166 A:middle
of the iPhone.

00:13:18.306 --> 00:13:19.526 A:middle
The iPhone was a very personal

00:13:19.526 --> 00:13:20.826 A:middle
device, and all these

00:13:20.826 --> 00:13:21.846 A:middle
interactions that you're doing

00:13:21.846 --> 00:13:23.106 A:middle
is with personal information,

00:13:24.186 --> 00:13:25.426 A:middle
and the iPhone was optimized for

00:13:25.426 --> 00:13:26.546 A:middle
quite short engagements.

00:13:26.986 --> 00:13:28.066 A:middle
And, all of these interactions,

00:13:28.336 --> 00:13:29.196 A:middle
they don't take very long.

00:13:29.266 --> 00:13:30.346 A:middle
You can do them relatively

00:13:30.346 --> 00:13:30.716 A:middle
quickly.

00:13:31.606 --> 00:13:32.986 A:middle
But, if you look at how that

00:13:32.986 --> 00:13:35.546 A:middle
scales to the Watch, we see that

00:13:35.546 --> 00:13:37.466 A:middle
actually the feature set is

00:13:37.466 --> 00:13:38.226 A:middle
greatly reduced.

00:13:39.426 --> 00:13:40.716 A:middle
And, again, this makes sense if

00:13:40.716 --> 00:13:41.926 A:middle
you think back about the context

00:13:42.266 --> 00:13:42.926 A:middle
of the Watch.

00:13:43.546 --> 00:13:44.366 A:middle
The Watch is still a very

00:13:44.436 --> 00:13:46.116 A:middle
personal device, and all these

00:13:46.116 --> 00:13:46.986 A:middle
interactions, all this

00:13:46.986 --> 00:13:48.076 A:middle
information is still very

00:13:48.076 --> 00:13:49.856 A:middle
personal, but as we said, the

00:13:49.856 --> 00:13:51.466 A:middle
Watch is optimized for really

00:13:51.466 --> 00:13:53.076 A:middle
short interactions, glances

00:13:53.076 --> 00:13:53.446 A:middle
almost.

00:13:54.386 --> 00:13:55.386 A:middle
So, we made sure that you can

00:13:55.386 --> 00:13:56.896 A:middle
look at your own progress at a

00:13:56.896 --> 00:13:58.296 A:middle
glance, and you can see how your

00:13:58.296 --> 00:13:59.786 A:middle
friends are doing at a glance.

00:14:01.396 --> 00:14:02.526 A:middle
So, one really big part about

00:14:02.526 --> 00:14:03.976 A:middle
adapting is seeing how you

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:05.406 A:middle
manage your interactions, your

00:14:05.406 --> 00:14:07.036 A:middle
functionality across all the

00:14:07.036 --> 00:14:07.996 A:middle
platforms that you want to be

00:14:07.996 --> 00:14:08.566 A:middle
available on.

00:14:09.106 --> 00:14:11.066 A:middle
Another part, is looking at what

00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:13.026 A:middle
unique capabilities a platform

00:14:13.026 --> 00:14:14.796 A:middle
can provide, and how your app

00:14:14.836 --> 00:14:15.686 A:middle
can benefit from that.

00:14:16.906 --> 00:14:18.036 A:middle
When we looked at the Watch, we

00:14:18.036 --> 00:14:19.446 A:middle
said, well, some of the unique

00:14:19.446 --> 00:14:21.396 A:middle
capabilities of the Watch is

00:14:21.396 --> 00:14:22.536 A:middle
that it can track your movement,

00:14:22.586 --> 00:14:23.786 A:middle
it can track your heartbeat,

00:14:24.106 --> 00:14:25.976 A:middle
your location, and all of that

00:14:25.976 --> 00:14:27.446 A:middle
information is quite relevant

00:14:27.446 --> 00:14:28.566 A:middle
for an app like Activity.

00:14:28.566 --> 00:14:30.596 A:middle
So, if you look at what

00:14:30.756 --> 00:14:32.126 A:middle
additional features we brought

00:14:32.126 --> 00:14:33.746 A:middle
to the Watch, well, you can add

00:14:33.746 --> 00:14:35.486 A:middle
a workout, and you can set move

00:14:35.486 --> 00:14:35.876 A:middle
goals.

00:14:36.336 --> 00:14:37.866 A:middle
And, again, this only makes

00:14:37.896 --> 00:14:39.196 A:middle
sense if you look at the context

00:14:39.196 --> 00:14:40.656 A:middle
and the capabilities of the

00:14:40.656 --> 00:14:41.046 A:middle
Watch.

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:44.486 A:middle
And that's exactly what adapting

00:14:44.486 --> 00:14:44.916 A:middle
is about.

00:14:45.436 --> 00:14:46.866 A:middle
It is prioritizing your feature,

00:14:47.266 --> 00:14:48.336 A:middle
your features based on the

00:14:48.406 --> 00:14:49.376 A:middle
platform's context and

00:14:49.376 --> 00:14:51.106 A:middle
capabilities, and it's

00:14:51.106 --> 00:14:52.416 A:middle
considering new features that

00:14:52.416 --> 00:14:53.966 A:middle
can benefit from the platform's

00:14:53.966 --> 00:14:55.126 A:middle
unique capabilities.

00:14:55.826 --> 00:15:00.126 A:middle
A really good example of this,

00:15:00.426 --> 00:15:01.056 A:middle
is Photoshop.

00:15:01.456 --> 00:15:02.566 A:middle
For those of you who've used

00:15:02.566 --> 00:15:03.786 A:middle
Photoshop on a MacBook or an

00:15:03.856 --> 00:15:05.296 A:middle
iMac, you know that it's a

00:15:05.376 --> 00:15:06.596 A:middle
really enormous, big app.

00:15:06.666 --> 00:15:08.106 A:middle
There's tons of features in

00:15:08.106 --> 00:15:08.296 A:middle
there.

00:15:08.466 --> 00:15:09.536 A:middle
You can do so many things.

00:15:10.426 --> 00:15:11.976 A:middle
But, Adobe did a really good job

00:15:12.096 --> 00:15:13.106 A:middle
when they tried to bring all

00:15:13.106 --> 00:15:14.746 A:middle
those features to the phone.

00:15:16.046 --> 00:15:17.126 A:middle
They actually broke down the

00:15:17.186 --> 00:15:19.226 A:middle
feature set into 3 really

00:15:19.226 --> 00:15:19.956 A:middle
distinct apps.

00:15:20.656 --> 00:15:21.646 A:middle
All of the interactions are

00:15:21.646 --> 00:15:22.806 A:middle
optimized for quite short

00:15:22.806 --> 00:15:24.506 A:middle
engagements, and they're

00:15:24.506 --> 00:15:25.376 A:middle
embracing the unique

00:15:25.376 --> 00:15:26.936 A:middle
capabilities of a phone by, for

00:15:26.936 --> 00:15:28.406 A:middle
example, being able to take a

00:15:28.406 --> 00:15:30.806 A:middle
picture right from within the

00:15:31.766 --> 00:15:31.846 A:middle
app.

00:15:32.296 --> 00:15:33.506 A:middle
Another good example is the New

00:15:33.506 --> 00:15:34.036 A:middle
York Times.

00:15:34.946 --> 00:15:36.016 A:middle
If you want to read an article

00:15:36.016 --> 00:15:37.266 A:middle
in the New York Times, you can

00:15:37.266 --> 00:15:38.736 A:middle
do that on the phone, on the

00:15:38.736 --> 00:15:40.376 A:middle
iPad, or on their website.

00:15:41.286 --> 00:15:42.076 A:middle
But, if you look at what they've

00:15:42.076 --> 00:15:43.826 A:middle
done on the Watch, you can only

00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:45.246 A:middle
look through a series of the

00:15:45.246 --> 00:15:47.226 A:middle
most recent headlines, and if

00:15:47.226 --> 00:15:48.076 A:middle
you're interested in one of

00:15:48.076 --> 00:15:49.506 A:middle
them, you can flick down and you

00:15:49.506 --> 00:15:51.026 A:middle
can see a small summary of that

00:15:51.026 --> 00:15:52.846 A:middle
article, but if you want to read

00:15:52.846 --> 00:15:54.176 A:middle
the full article, well that's a

00:15:54.176 --> 00:15:55.816 A:middle
longer engagement, so it's no

00:15:55.886 --> 00:15:57.316 A:middle
longer optimized for the Watch.

00:15:57.756 --> 00:15:59.086 A:middle
And, therefore, they ask you to

00:15:59.086 --> 00:16:01.866 A:middle
go to the iPhone, the iPad, or

00:16:01.866 --> 00:16:02.326 A:middle
the website.

00:16:02.906 --> 00:16:06.746 A:middle
So, that was adapting.

00:16:07.706 --> 00:16:09.236 A:middle
In step one, we looked at what

00:16:09.396 --> 00:16:10.696 A:middle
platforms you wanted to go to,

00:16:11.056 --> 00:16:11.946 A:middle
and step two we looked at the

00:16:11.946 --> 00:16:13.606 A:middle
features, and now we're going to

00:16:13.606 --> 00:16:14.956 A:middle
look at the look and feel.

00:16:16.906 --> 00:16:18.026 A:middle
When people talk about look and

00:16:18.086 --> 00:16:19.306 A:middle
feel, they often think about the

00:16:19.306 --> 00:16:21.306 A:middle
word consistent, and that's

00:16:21.306 --> 00:16:23.286 A:middle
definitely a very important word

00:16:23.516 --> 00:16:24.336 A:middle
when we're talking about

00:16:24.536 --> 00:16:25.696 A:middle
bringing your app to multiple

00:16:25.696 --> 00:16:26.176 A:middle
platforms.

00:16:27.376 --> 00:16:28.726 A:middle
But, consistent doesn't mean

00:16:28.806 --> 00:16:29.406 A:middle
identical.

00:16:30.126 --> 00:16:31.616 A:middle
At Apple, we don't just copy and

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:33.316 A:middle
paste all functionality and all

00:16:33.316 --> 00:16:34.536 A:middle
the visual elements from one

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:35.336 A:middle
platform to another.

00:16:36.436 --> 00:16:38.036 A:middle
Being consistent is much more of

00:16:38.036 --> 00:16:38.726 A:middle
a balancing act.

00:16:38.726 --> 00:16:40.576 A:middle
You have to balance between two

00:16:40.576 --> 00:16:41.586 A:middle
types of consistency.

00:16:42.966 --> 00:16:44.296 A:middle
On one side, you have your brand

00:16:44.296 --> 00:16:44.906 A:middle
consistency.

00:16:45.706 --> 00:16:47.106 A:middle
This means that when people open

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:48.766 A:middle
your app, they should recognize

00:16:48.766 --> 00:16:50.466 A:middle
your brand, it should feel very

00:16:50.466 --> 00:16:52.076 A:middle
familiar, and hopefully that

00:16:52.076 --> 00:16:53.676 A:middle
will build trust between the

00:16:53.676 --> 00:16:55.256 A:middle
person who's using your app, and

00:16:55.256 --> 00:16:55.686 A:middle
your brand.

00:16:56.256 --> 00:16:58.356 A:middle
On the other side, you have the

00:16:58.416 --> 00:16:59.196 A:middle
platform guidelines.

00:17:00.366 --> 00:17:01.396 A:middle
This means you'd be using

00:17:01.436 --> 00:17:03.046 A:middle
platform-provided standards, so

00:17:03.046 --> 00:17:04.096 A:middle
your app feels native.

00:17:05.306 --> 00:17:06.826 A:middle
Since these standards reoccur on

00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:08.136 A:middle
all the apps on that platform,

00:17:08.506 --> 00:17:09.166 A:middle
they will feel very

00:17:09.166 --> 00:17:09.926 A:middle
recognizable.

00:17:10.956 --> 00:17:12.276 A:middle
That lowers the cognitive load,

00:17:12.446 --> 00:17:13.366 A:middle
and that eases the learning

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:13.616 A:middle
curve.

00:17:14.886 --> 00:17:16.056 A:middle
So, finding the balance between

00:17:16.056 --> 00:17:17.536 A:middle
these two types of consistencies

00:17:17.866 --> 00:17:19.406 A:middle
is really important, and maybe

00:17:19.566 --> 00:17:21.186 A:middle
the most difficult exercise in

00:17:21.186 --> 00:17:21.796 A:middle
this whole process.

00:17:21.796 --> 00:17:24.976 A:middle
The human interface guidelines

00:17:24.976 --> 00:17:26.226 A:middle
can be a really good help here.

00:17:26.826 --> 00:17:28.206 A:middle
They can help you understand all

00:17:28.206 --> 00:17:29.516 A:middle
the platform-provided standards

00:17:29.516 --> 00:17:31.346 A:middle
and guidelines, but it can also

00:17:31.346 --> 00:17:33.026 A:middle
help you understand where your

00:17:33.026 --> 00:17:34.316 A:middle
brand can really come alive

00:17:34.576 --> 00:17:35.456 A:middle
within these guidelines.

00:17:37.086 --> 00:17:39.046 A:middle
One example is the typefaces we

00:17:39.046 --> 00:17:39.266 A:middle
have.

00:17:39.956 --> 00:17:42.136 A:middle
You see that for each platform

00:17:42.136 --> 00:17:43.636 A:middle
we have a nice set of typefaces

00:17:43.636 --> 00:17:45.006 A:middle
that you can use, and they're

00:17:45.006 --> 00:17:46.276 A:middle
all optimized for the platform

00:17:46.276 --> 00:17:46.586 A:middle
they're on.

00:17:47.706 --> 00:17:48.736 A:middle
This doesn't mean that you have

00:17:48.796 --> 00:17:50.046 A:middle
to use San Francisco, or you

00:17:50.046 --> 00:17:51.106 A:middle
have to use this specific

00:17:51.156 --> 00:17:53.696 A:middle
typeface or style, but it gives

00:17:53.696 --> 00:17:55.106 A:middle
you a really good idea on what

00:17:55.106 --> 00:17:56.536 A:middle
sizes work well for each

00:17:56.536 --> 00:17:56.956 A:middle
platform.

00:17:57.556 --> 00:18:00.106 A:middle
If you take a look at the body

00:18:00.106 --> 00:18:01.526 A:middle
style for example, on these

00:18:01.526 --> 00:18:03.406 A:middle
three platforms, you'll see that

00:18:03.406 --> 00:18:05.376 A:middle
they nicely scale up, and that

00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:06.356 A:middle
has to do with the viewing

00:18:06.356 --> 00:18:06.766 A:middle
distance.

00:18:08.036 --> 00:18:10.106 A:middle
On a Watch, you look at a Watch

00:18:10.106 --> 00:18:11.976 A:middle
from quite close, maybe a foot

00:18:11.976 --> 00:18:13.386 A:middle
away, so it's quite small.

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:15.606 A:middle
A phone is a little bit further

00:18:15.606 --> 00:18:17.176 A:middle
maybe one and a half foot, so

00:18:17.176 --> 00:18:18.116 A:middle
it's a tiny bit bigger.

00:18:19.476 --> 00:18:21.116 A:middle
But on a TV as we said before,

00:18:21.116 --> 00:18:22.396 A:middle
it was optimized for a 10-foot

00:18:22.396 --> 00:18:24.276 A:middle
distance, so we made it really

00:18:24.276 --> 00:18:26.186 A:middle
big so you can read it from that

00:18:26.186 --> 00:18:27.516 A:middle
distance quite comfortably.

00:18:28.006 --> 00:18:30.476 A:middle
Apart from the stylistic

00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:32.606 A:middle
features, the human interface

00:18:32.606 --> 00:18:33.856 A:middle
guidelines can also help you

00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:35.506 A:middle
with platform-provided standards

00:18:35.506 --> 00:18:36.276 A:middle
and functionality.

00:18:36.936 --> 00:18:38.066 A:middle
For example, alerts.

00:18:38.996 --> 00:18:40.566 A:middle
Alerts come on every single

00:18:40.626 --> 00:18:41.426 A:middle
platform that we have.

00:18:41.916 --> 00:18:42.946 A:middle
And, they have some common

00:18:42.946 --> 00:18:43.366 A:middle
elements.

00:18:44.066 --> 00:18:45.646 A:middle
They have a description, they

00:18:45.646 --> 00:18:48.426 A:middle
have one or two actions, they

00:18:48.616 --> 00:18:50.136 A:middle
obscure the content behind them.

00:18:50.646 --> 00:18:52.246 A:middle
But, if you look at the length

00:18:52.246 --> 00:18:53.636 A:middle
of the description, the styling

00:18:53.636 --> 00:18:55.446 A:middle
of the buttons, the tap targets,

00:18:55.956 --> 00:18:57.106 A:middle
they're all optimized for each

00:18:57.106 --> 00:18:57.566 A:middle
platform.

00:18:58.396 --> 00:18:59.666 A:middle
So, using an alert like this

00:18:59.666 --> 00:19:01.286 A:middle
will make the -- will be very

00:19:01.286 --> 00:19:02.346 A:middle
familiar to the user,

00:19:03.026 --> 00:19:04.816 A:middle
recognizable, and therefore easy

00:19:04.816 --> 00:19:05.146 A:middle
to use.

00:19:06.506 --> 00:19:07.776 A:middle
The same goes for navigation.

00:19:09.216 --> 00:19:11.726 A:middle
If I want to navigate to the

00:19:11.726 --> 00:19:14.006 A:middle
previous screen on my Watch, I

00:19:14.006 --> 00:19:15.156 A:middle
can just tap the top left

00:19:15.156 --> 00:19:15.426 A:middle
corner.

00:19:15.996 --> 00:19:18.556 A:middle
The same happens on the iPhone.

00:19:19.946 --> 00:19:21.586 A:middle
But, if you look at a TV, well

00:19:21.636 --> 00:19:22.856 A:middle
there is no back button on the

00:19:22.856 --> 00:19:23.256 A:middle
screen.

00:19:23.946 --> 00:19:24.986 A:middle
And, that's because the back

00:19:25.046 --> 00:19:26.526 A:middle
button is actually located on

00:19:26.526 --> 00:19:26.956 A:middle
your remote.

00:19:27.906 --> 00:19:29.016 A:middle
So, there's no need to add an

00:19:29.016 --> 00:19:30.506 A:middle
extra button on the screen to

00:19:30.506 --> 00:19:35.016 A:middle
navigate to, and to click.

00:19:35.336 --> 00:19:36.466 A:middle
So, that's exactly what

00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:37.306 A:middle
conforming is about.

00:19:37.816 --> 00:19:40.146 A:middle
It's finding the balance between

00:19:40.146 --> 00:19:41.516 A:middle
your brand and the platform

00:19:41.516 --> 00:19:41.966 A:middle
guidelines.

00:19:42.956 --> 00:19:44.026 A:middle
It's aligning with your brand,

00:19:44.056 --> 00:19:44.846 A:middle
so your brand feels

00:19:44.846 --> 00:19:46.846 A:middle
recognizable, familiar, and can

00:19:46.846 --> 00:19:47.386 A:middle
create trust.

00:19:48.806 --> 00:19:49.576 A:middle
And, it's aligning with the

00:19:49.636 --> 00:19:50.546 A:middle
platform guidelines and

00:19:50.546 --> 00:19:52.116 A:middle
functionality to lower the

00:19:52.116 --> 00:19:54.166 A:middle
cognitive load and to ease the

00:19:54.166 --> 00:19:54.666 A:middle
learning curve.

00:19:55.366 --> 00:19:58.966 A:middle
A really good example is

00:19:59.376 --> 00:20:01.046 A:middle
Ulysses, and I really hope I'm

00:20:01.046 --> 00:20:01.736 A:middle
pronouncing that right.

00:20:02.426 --> 00:20:02.926 A:middle
If not, I'm sorry.

00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:06.346 A:middle
If you use this app on the iPad,

00:20:06.346 --> 00:20:08.246 A:middle
the iPhone, or the Mac, you'll

00:20:08.246 --> 00:20:09.266 A:middle
notice a whole bunch of

00:20:09.346 --> 00:20:10.466 A:middle
platform-provided standards.

00:20:10.996 --> 00:20:12.306 A:middle
They're using navigation bars,

00:20:12.526 --> 00:20:14.816 A:middle
toolbars, search fields, and

00:20:14.816 --> 00:20:15.376 A:middle
split views.

00:20:15.866 --> 00:20:18.116 A:middle
And, where their brand is really

00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:19.616 A:middle
represented is in the writing

00:20:19.616 --> 00:20:20.256 A:middle
experience.

00:20:21.066 --> 00:20:22.956 A:middle
By allowing dedicated focus, and

00:20:22.986 --> 00:20:24.336 A:middle
quick formatting with markdown,

00:20:24.806 --> 00:20:26.076 A:middle
writing becomes an amazing

00:20:26.076 --> 00:20:27.316 A:middle
experience in this app.

00:20:28.256 --> 00:20:29.986 A:middle
I use this app very frequently

00:20:29.986 --> 00:20:31.276 A:middle
in my process, and in fact, this

00:20:31.276 --> 00:20:33.726 A:middle
presentation started in this

00:20:34.306 --> 00:20:34.386 A:middle
app.

00:20:34.656 --> 00:20:35.886 A:middle
Another good example is Streaks.

00:20:37.066 --> 00:20:38.026 A:middle
With Streaks, you immediately

00:20:38.026 --> 00:20:39.256 A:middle
recognize the brand through the

00:20:39.286 --> 00:20:41.036 A:middle
color, the typography, the

00:20:41.036 --> 00:20:42.546 A:middle
iconography, even the

00:20:42.546 --> 00:20:43.936 A:middle
interaction of long-holding to

00:20:43.936 --> 00:20:44.726 A:middle
complete a task.

00:20:45.596 --> 00:20:46.736 A:middle
But, they really embraced the

00:20:46.736 --> 00:20:48.246 A:middle
platform guidelines with, for

00:20:48.246 --> 00:20:49.486 A:middle
example, doing very smart

00:20:49.486 --> 00:20:51.326 A:middle
notifications, scaling the

00:20:51.326 --> 00:20:53.576 A:middle
typography, and adapting to new

00:20:53.576 --> 00:20:54.026 A:middle
languages.

00:20:54.636 --> 00:20:57.146 A:middle
And a last good example, is

00:20:57.216 --> 00:20:57.546 A:middle
Tinder.

00:20:58.246 --> 00:20:59.406 A:middle
Again, you would recognize the

00:20:59.406 --> 00:21:00.796 A:middle
iconography, you recognize the

00:21:00.796 --> 00:21:02.616 A:middle
colors, the interaction of

00:21:02.616 --> 00:21:03.646 A:middle
swiping left and right.

00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:06.016 A:middle
But, again, they really aligned

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:07.036 A:middle
with the platform guidelines.

00:21:07.656 --> 00:21:09.436 A:middle
The UI scales up very nicely to

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:11.136 A:middle
the different platforms, and

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:12.216 A:middle
their unique interaction of

00:21:12.216 --> 00:21:13.756 A:middle
swiping left and right never

00:21:13.756 --> 00:21:14.936 A:middle
interferes with platform

00:21:14.936 --> 00:21:15.556 A:middle
functionality.

00:21:16.516 --> 00:21:19.876 A:middle
OK, that was step three.

00:21:20.406 --> 00:21:23.536 A:middle
So, if this is the first time

00:21:23.536 --> 00:21:24.306 A:middle
you're going to launch your app

00:21:24.346 --> 00:21:26.016 A:middle
on your first platform, you're

00:21:26.016 --> 00:21:26.686 A:middle
pretty much done.

00:21:27.006 --> 00:21:28.246 A:middle
You selected your platform,

00:21:28.706 --> 00:21:29.866 A:middle
you've defined your features,

00:21:30.306 --> 00:21:31.076 A:middle
you've defined your look and

00:21:31.076 --> 00:21:31.396 A:middle
feel.

00:21:32.226 --> 00:21:33.196 A:middle
Now, you can start building it

00:21:33.196 --> 00:21:34.206 A:middle
and hopefully launch it on the

00:21:34.206 --> 00:21:34.686 A:middle
App Store.

00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:36.716 A:middle
But, if this is an app that you

00:21:36.716 --> 00:21:38.156 A:middle
want to launch on your second,

00:21:38.206 --> 00:21:39.776 A:middle
third, or next platform,

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:41.736 A:middle
connecting becomes a really

00:21:41.736 --> 00:21:43.126 A:middle
important step.

00:21:43.226 --> 00:21:47.346 A:middle
When we talk about connecting,

00:21:47.536 --> 00:21:48.966 A:middle
two points in your experience

00:21:49.096 --> 00:21:49.986 A:middle
are really important.

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:52.616 A:middle
You have the entry point and the

00:21:52.616 --> 00:21:53.116 A:middle
exit point.

00:21:54.276 --> 00:21:55.556 A:middle
The entry point is when you open

00:21:55.556 --> 00:21:56.786 A:middle
the app, and you start using it.

00:21:57.626 --> 00:21:59.116 A:middle
The exit point is, hopefully

00:21:59.116 --> 00:22:00.256 A:middle
after a while, when you've done

00:22:00.256 --> 00:22:02.266 A:middle
some work in the app, you close

00:22:02.266 --> 00:22:03.506 A:middle
it and you go do something else.

00:22:05.586 --> 00:22:06.816 A:middle
These two points are really

00:22:06.816 --> 00:22:08.156 A:middle
important, even when you're just

00:22:08.156 --> 00:22:09.196 A:middle
using one platform.

00:22:10.366 --> 00:22:11.756 A:middle
Every time you open the app

00:22:11.756 --> 00:22:13.306 A:middle
again, you hope it doesn't just

00:22:13.356 --> 00:22:14.736 A:middle
give you that same opening

00:22:14.736 --> 00:22:15.106 A:middle
screen.

00:22:15.946 --> 00:22:17.186 A:middle
But, that it actually helps you

00:22:17.186 --> 00:22:18.486 A:middle
create the same environment you

00:22:18.486 --> 00:22:20.146 A:middle
were in the last time you had

00:22:20.146 --> 00:22:20.786 A:middle
the app open.

00:22:21.806 --> 00:22:23.486 A:middle
That is what we call recreating

00:22:23.486 --> 00:22:23.856 A:middle
state.

00:22:24.516 --> 00:22:25.556 A:middle
And, by state, we mean the

00:22:25.596 --> 00:22:27.486 A:middle
content and the information, and

00:22:27.486 --> 00:22:28.716 A:middle
the settings that you were using

00:22:28.716 --> 00:22:30.036 A:middle
the last time you had the app

00:22:30.036 --> 00:22:30.356 A:middle
open.

00:22:31.656 --> 00:22:34.056 A:middle
The state can take any shape or

00:22:34.116 --> 00:22:35.476 A:middle
form depending on what your app

00:22:35.476 --> 00:22:35.676 A:middle
does.

00:22:36.606 --> 00:22:37.856 A:middle
For a simple app like Weather,

00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:39.696 A:middle
for example, it should at least

00:22:39.696 --> 00:22:41.416 A:middle
open up on the same location or

00:22:41.416 --> 00:22:42.496 A:middle
city that you were looking at

00:22:42.496 --> 00:22:43.536 A:middle
the last time you had the app

00:22:43.536 --> 00:22:43.876 A:middle
open.

00:22:44.476 --> 00:22:45.796 A:middle
Preferably with the weather

00:22:45.796 --> 00:22:46.706 A:middle
information updated.

00:22:48.106 --> 00:22:49.396 A:middle
For a more complex app like

00:22:49.396 --> 00:22:51.176 A:middle
Notes, it would open the same

00:22:51.176 --> 00:22:52.356 A:middle
note you were working in last

00:22:52.356 --> 00:22:54.476 A:middle
time, if possible, with the same

00:22:54.476 --> 00:22:55.466 A:middle
tools selected.

00:22:55.986 --> 00:22:59.486 A:middle
And, for apps that revolve

00:22:59.486 --> 00:23:01.216 A:middle
around media for example, like

00:23:01.216 --> 00:23:03.296 A:middle
games, movies, or TV shows, you

00:23:03.296 --> 00:23:04.806 A:middle
would hope it would resume where

00:23:04.806 --> 00:23:05.626 A:middle
you last left off.

00:23:06.226 --> 00:23:07.376 A:middle
So, for example, in the game you

00:23:07.376 --> 00:23:08.456 A:middle
wouldn't have to play that game

00:23:08.456 --> 00:23:09.636 A:middle
all over again just to get to

00:23:09.636 --> 00:23:10.356 A:middle
that same point.

00:23:14.086 --> 00:23:15.436 A:middle
Remembering state becomes even

00:23:15.436 --> 00:23:16.326 A:middle
more important when you're

00:23:16.326 --> 00:23:17.886 A:middle
switching between platforms.

00:23:18.216 --> 00:23:21.086 A:middle
Being able to remember and

00:23:21.086 --> 00:23:22.846 A:middle
recreate the last used state on

00:23:22.886 --> 00:23:24.986 A:middle
any platform creates a very

00:23:24.986 --> 00:23:26.526 A:middle
effortless and delightful

00:23:26.646 --> 00:23:27.216 A:middle
experience.

00:23:28.206 --> 00:23:29.416 A:middle
It allows people to enjoy your

00:23:29.416 --> 00:23:30.836 A:middle
app in whichever context they

00:23:30.836 --> 00:23:32.226 A:middle
like, because you as an app

00:23:32.226 --> 00:23:34.066 A:middle
developer and designer, you will

00:23:34.066 --> 00:23:35.316 A:middle
take care of optimizing that

00:23:35.316 --> 00:23:36.886 A:middle
experience for the platform.

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:40.096 A:middle
At Apple, we really try to

00:23:40.096 --> 00:23:41.406 A:middle
embrace connecting platforms.

00:23:42.306 --> 00:23:44.546 A:middle
For example, in TV, the state

00:23:44.546 --> 00:23:46.916 A:middle
the TV app remembers is where

00:23:46.916 --> 00:23:48.016 A:middle
you last stopped watching.

00:23:49.146 --> 00:23:50.486 A:middle
The TV show you were watching

00:23:50.486 --> 00:23:51.776 A:middle
and the time you paused is

00:23:51.876 --> 00:23:53.156 A:middle
synced across all the devices,

00:23:53.616 --> 00:23:54.786 A:middle
so you can resume on any

00:23:54.786 --> 00:23:56.116 A:middle
platform of your choosing.

00:23:56.626 --> 00:23:59.166 A:middle
Another good example is Maps.

00:23:59.436 --> 00:24:01.046 A:middle
This morning I looked up on my

00:24:01.046 --> 00:24:02.476 A:middle
MacBook how to get to this

00:24:02.476 --> 00:24:03.186 A:middle
convention center.

00:24:03.886 --> 00:24:05.626 A:middle
Because I did that, that search

00:24:05.626 --> 00:24:06.796 A:middle
went into my recent searches.

00:24:07.586 --> 00:24:09.296 A:middle
And, recent searches is a state

00:24:09.296 --> 00:24:10.416 A:middle
that's being recreated on all

00:24:10.416 --> 00:24:10.866 A:middle
platforms.

00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:13.316 A:middle
So when I step into my car, that

00:24:13.316 --> 00:24:14.406 A:middle
recent search popped up in the

00:24:14.406 --> 00:24:16.016 A:middle
list, I can just tap it and get

00:24:16.056 --> 00:24:16.316 A:middle
going.

00:24:20.166 --> 00:24:21.696 A:middle
This all works really well if

00:24:21.696 --> 00:24:23.056 A:middle
you have your apps set up on all

00:24:23.056 --> 00:24:24.186 A:middle
your platforms, and you're good

00:24:24.186 --> 00:24:24.516 A:middle
to go.

00:24:24.516 --> 00:24:26.816 A:middle
But what happens when a new

00:24:26.876 --> 00:24:27.566 A:middle
platform comes in?

00:24:28.766 --> 00:24:29.736 A:middle
Let's say that you're using a

00:24:29.736 --> 00:24:31.626 A:middle
MacBook and a phone, and

00:24:31.656 --> 00:24:33.096 A:middle
suddenly you buy an iPad, and it

00:24:33.096 --> 00:24:33.966 A:middle
becomes a part of your

00:24:33.966 --> 00:24:34.576 A:middle
day-to-day life.

00:24:35.906 --> 00:24:37.066 A:middle
Well, you install the app on the

00:24:37.066 --> 00:24:38.586 A:middle
iPad, and most of the time

00:24:38.586 --> 00:24:40.526 A:middle
before the app can actually

00:24:40.526 --> 00:24:41.706 A:middle
recreate the state you were in,

00:24:42.016 --> 00:24:43.386 A:middle
it needs a bit more information.

00:24:44.086 --> 00:24:45.066 A:middle
There's an additional step

00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:46.066 A:middle
that's required, which is a

00:24:46.066 --> 00:24:46.626 A:middle
set-up step.

00:24:47.846 --> 00:24:48.966 A:middle
The app needs to know who you

00:24:48.966 --> 00:24:50.216 A:middle
are, so it can recreate the

00:24:50.216 --> 00:24:51.696 A:middle
state you were in, the last time

00:24:51.696 --> 00:24:53.186 A:middle
you had the app open on another

00:24:53.246 --> 00:24:53.676 A:middle
platform.

00:24:54.516 --> 00:24:56.296 A:middle
And, often, such a set-up step

00:24:56.456 --> 00:24:57.386 A:middle
looks something like this.

00:24:58.176 --> 00:24:59.236 A:middle
And, this can be quite

00:24:59.236 --> 00:24:59.626 A:middle
off-putting.

00:24:59.626 --> 00:25:01.516 A:middle
You have to remember your email

00:25:01.516 --> 00:25:02.686 A:middle
address, your user name, your

00:25:02.686 --> 00:25:04.356 A:middle
password, you have to type it

00:25:04.356 --> 00:25:05.736 A:middle
in, you might type it in wrong.

00:25:06.426 --> 00:25:07.476 A:middle
In the end, it might be so

00:25:07.476 --> 00:25:09.076 A:middle
off-putting that you actually

00:25:09.076 --> 00:25:10.026 A:middle
skip this and you don't want to

00:25:10.026 --> 00:25:10.926 A:middle
use this app on your new

00:25:10.996 --> 00:25:11.396 A:middle
platform.

00:25:12.386 --> 00:25:13.806 A:middle
But, luckily with features like

00:25:13.806 --> 00:25:15.756 A:middle
iCloud Keychain, you can just

00:25:15.756 --> 00:25:17.036 A:middle
make this step really effortless

00:25:17.036 --> 00:25:17.526 A:middle
and easy.

00:25:17.896 --> 00:25:19.486 A:middle
With the tap of a button, iCloud

00:25:19.486 --> 00:25:20.976 A:middle
Keychain can fill in your user

00:25:20.976 --> 00:25:22.626 A:middle
name, your email, and your

00:25:22.626 --> 00:25:24.156 A:middle
password, and you're just good

00:25:24.186 --> 00:25:24.466 A:middle
to go.

00:25:26.216 --> 00:25:28.226 A:middle
At Apple, we really embrace this

00:25:28.316 --> 00:25:29.826 A:middle
part as well, this set-up step,

00:25:29.826 --> 00:25:31.556 A:middle
especially with new platforms.

00:25:32.646 --> 00:25:34.056 A:middle
If you buy an Apple TV, you

00:25:34.056 --> 00:25:34.836 A:middle
don't have to set it up

00:25:34.836 --> 00:25:37.166 A:middle
manually, you can just hold your

00:25:37.166 --> 00:25:38.516 A:middle
iPhone or your iPad close to the

00:25:38.516 --> 00:25:40.496 A:middle
Apple TV, and it will move over

00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:41.996 A:middle
all the apps that are compatible

00:25:41.996 --> 00:25:43.956 A:middle
with Apple TV as well as your

00:25:43.956 --> 00:25:45.076 A:middle
iTunes store credentials.

00:25:46.506 --> 00:25:47.796 A:middle
So when the Apple TV has done

00:25:47.856 --> 00:25:49.226 A:middle
setting up, you will recognize

00:25:49.226 --> 00:25:50.326 A:middle
all the apps that are on there,

00:25:50.456 --> 00:25:51.326 A:middle
because you also have them on

00:25:51.326 --> 00:25:52.736 A:middle
your phone, and you can

00:25:52.736 --> 00:25:54.066 A:middle
immediately start buying TV

00:25:54.066 --> 00:25:56.446 A:middle
shows, movies, or games, because

00:25:56.446 --> 00:25:58.356 A:middle
the iTunes store credentials are

00:25:58.436 --> 00:25:59.166 A:middle
there as well.

00:25:59.726 --> 00:26:01.616 A:middle
So, those are really good

00:26:01.616 --> 00:26:03.086 A:middle
examples of connecting.

00:26:04.266 --> 00:26:05.436 A:middle
Connecting is creating a

00:26:05.436 --> 00:26:06.686 A:middle
continuous experience between

00:26:06.756 --> 00:26:08.476 A:middle
platforms, by remembering the

00:26:08.476 --> 00:26:09.856 A:middle
state, and optimizing for the

00:26:09.856 --> 00:26:11.106 A:middle
entry and exit point.

00:26:12.066 --> 00:26:13.256 A:middle
And, it's allowing for a quick

00:26:13.256 --> 00:26:14.836 A:middle
and easy way to use this new

00:26:14.876 --> 00:26:15.306 A:middle
platform.

00:26:15.886 --> 00:26:20.366 A:middle
A really good example is Things.

00:26:21.216 --> 00:26:21.936 A:middle
The state that they're

00:26:21.936 --> 00:26:23.516 A:middle
recreating is your to-do list.

00:26:24.226 --> 00:26:25.866 A:middle
On any platform that you access

00:26:25.996 --> 00:26:27.886 A:middle
Things on, you can add a to-do

00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:29.366 A:middle
item, you can mark one as done,

00:26:29.366 --> 00:26:30.736 A:middle
you can add a due date or

00:26:30.736 --> 00:26:32.536 A:middle
organize it, and it will just

00:26:32.536 --> 00:26:33.846 A:middle
sync that information across all

00:26:33.846 --> 00:26:35.606 A:middle
your devices simultaneously.

00:26:35.966 --> 00:26:39.166 A:middle
Deliveries does a very similar

00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:39.446 A:middle
thing.

00:26:40.426 --> 00:26:43.306 A:middle
It remembers a list of tracking

00:26:43.306 --> 00:26:44.476 A:middle
numbers that you've saved in

00:26:44.526 --> 00:26:46.396 A:middle
iCloud, and it will update the

00:26:46.396 --> 00:26:47.956 A:middle
information from the delivery

00:26:47.956 --> 00:26:49.806 A:middle
service for each single item.

00:26:50.436 --> 00:26:51.336 A:middle
And, that information is

00:26:51.336 --> 00:26:53.006 A:middle
accessible on any platform you

00:26:53.006 --> 00:26:53.676 A:middle
open it up on.

00:26:54.246 --> 00:26:56.486 A:middle
And, a really good example of a

00:26:56.486 --> 00:26:57.996 A:middle
seamless login experience is

00:26:57.996 --> 00:26:58.496 A:middle
Instagram.

00:26:59.296 --> 00:27:00.566 A:middle
If you install Instagram, and

00:27:00.566 --> 00:27:01.716 A:middle
you have Facebook installed, it

00:27:02.586 --> 00:27:04.116 A:middle
will just use those credentials

00:27:04.166 --> 00:27:05.206 A:middle
to get you logged in to

00:27:05.206 --> 00:27:05.726 A:middle
Instagram.

00:27:06.056 --> 00:27:07.056 A:middle
So, with a simple tap of a

00:27:07.056 --> 00:27:08.886 A:middle
button, Instagram is opened up

00:27:08.886 --> 00:27:09.976 A:middle
for you, and you're good to go.

00:27:14.456 --> 00:27:15.716 A:middle
So, that was connecting.

00:27:16.296 --> 00:27:17.716 A:middle
We looked at what happens when

00:27:17.716 --> 00:27:18.906 A:middle
you go from one platform to

00:27:18.906 --> 00:27:19.246 A:middle
another.

00:27:20.196 --> 00:27:22.146 A:middle
In step five, we actually look

00:27:22.146 --> 00:27:23.346 A:middle
at what happens when two

00:27:23.346 --> 00:27:25.376 A:middle
platforms are available at the

00:27:25.376 --> 00:27:25.926 A:middle
same time.

00:27:27.706 --> 00:27:28.846 A:middle
And, to do that, I'm going to go

00:27:28.846 --> 00:27:30.236 A:middle
back to what we talked about in

00:27:30.236 --> 00:27:32.296 A:middle
step one, in selecting, to the

00:27:32.336 --> 00:27:33.906 A:middle
context and the capabilities of

00:27:33.906 --> 00:27:34.486 A:middle
the platforms.

00:27:36.386 --> 00:27:37.486 A:middle
Let's look at the MacBook again.

00:27:38.206 --> 00:27:39.466 A:middle
We said, well, it had a very

00:27:39.466 --> 00:27:41.066 A:middle
high performance, you could do

00:27:41.066 --> 00:27:42.116 A:middle
really precise work with the

00:27:42.116 --> 00:27:43.506 A:middle
keyboard and mouse, it could do

00:27:43.506 --> 00:27:45.456 A:middle
multitasking, but maybe what

00:27:45.456 --> 00:27:46.886 A:middle
it's not really good at, is

00:27:46.886 --> 00:27:48.506 A:middle
exactly knowing who you are.

00:27:49.556 --> 00:27:51.206 A:middle
In fact, when I open up my

00:27:51.206 --> 00:27:53.136 A:middle
MacBook from sleep or I start it

00:27:53.136 --> 00:27:55.946 A:middle
up from when it's off, I get

00:27:55.946 --> 00:27:56.496 A:middle
something like this.

00:27:57.426 --> 00:27:58.956 A:middle
I have to type in my password or

00:27:58.956 --> 00:28:00.306 A:middle
I have to give my Touch ID to

00:28:00.386 --> 00:28:00.826 A:middle
login.

00:28:01.666 --> 00:28:03.076 A:middle
And, again, just like the login

00:28:03.076 --> 00:28:04.826 A:middle
experience before, if I need to

00:28:04.826 --> 00:28:06.496 A:middle
type in my password, that could

00:28:06.496 --> 00:28:07.266 A:middle
be quite off-putting.

00:28:08.056 --> 00:28:09.346 A:middle
I have to remember it, I might

00:28:09.346 --> 00:28:11.046 A:middle
type it wrong, it could take a

00:28:11.046 --> 00:28:11.656 A:middle
couple of times.

00:28:12.566 --> 00:28:13.836 A:middle
But, this is the only way for

00:28:13.836 --> 00:28:14.996 A:middle
the MacBook to know who I am.

00:28:15.766 --> 00:28:16.836 A:middle
There's really no other way for

00:28:16.836 --> 00:28:18.076 A:middle
it to verify my identity.

00:28:18.916 --> 00:28:20.486 A:middle
But, if you bring in a Watch,

00:28:20.906 --> 00:28:22.176 A:middle
well, a Watch is always on and

00:28:22.176 --> 00:28:23.856 A:middle
always with you, and it actually

00:28:23.856 --> 00:28:24.676 A:middle
knows who you are.

00:28:25.566 --> 00:28:26.966 A:middle
So, when these two start talking

00:28:26.966 --> 00:28:28.786 A:middle
to each other, really magical

00:28:28.786 --> 00:28:29.526 A:middle
things can happen.

00:28:30.706 --> 00:28:32.226 A:middle
The Watch can tell you -- can

00:28:32.226 --> 00:28:33.526 A:middle
tell the MacBook, that this is

00:28:33.526 --> 00:28:35.796 A:middle
actually you, and login for you,

00:28:36.026 --> 00:28:37.886 A:middle
and before you know it, your

00:28:37.886 --> 00:28:41.316 A:middle
MacBook just opens up for you.

00:28:41.666 --> 00:28:42.726 A:middle
What's really important to note

00:28:42.726 --> 00:28:44.476 A:middle
here, is how effortless this

00:28:44.476 --> 00:28:45.076 A:middle
experience is.

00:28:45.806 --> 00:28:47.046 A:middle
I don't have to tell my MacBook

00:28:47.106 --> 00:28:48.236 A:middle
to listen to my Watch.

00:28:48.876 --> 00:28:49.996 A:middle
I don't have to tell the Watch

00:28:50.036 --> 00:28:50.986 A:middle
to give information to the

00:28:50.986 --> 00:28:51.426 A:middle
MacBook.

00:28:51.936 --> 00:28:53.026 A:middle
It just happens because they're

00:28:53.066 --> 00:28:53.536 A:middle
close.

00:28:54.106 --> 00:28:57.226 A:middle
In fact, I don't have to do

00:28:57.226 --> 00:28:57.406 A:middle
anything.

00:28:57.516 --> 00:28:58.476 A:middle
So, making an experience

00:28:58.476 --> 00:28:59.616 A:middle
effortless when you have

00:28:59.656 --> 00:29:01.546 A:middle
multiple platforms available, is

00:29:01.546 --> 00:29:02.256 A:middle
really important.

00:29:03.726 --> 00:29:04.936 A:middle
Adding a platform should not

00:29:04.936 --> 00:29:06.306 A:middle
result in adding additional

00:29:06.306 --> 00:29:06.556 A:middle
steps.

00:29:06.556 --> 00:29:09.626 A:middle
Let's look at another platform,

00:29:09.626 --> 00:29:11.266 A:middle
let's look at the iMac.

00:29:12.586 --> 00:29:14.286 A:middle
As we said before, iMac, high

00:29:14.286 --> 00:29:16.746 A:middle
performance, big display, really

00:29:16.746 --> 00:29:17.966 A:middle
good for, for example, browsing

00:29:17.966 --> 00:29:18.996 A:middle
the internet, and maybe even

00:29:18.996 --> 00:29:19.396 A:middle
shopping.

00:29:20.666 --> 00:29:21.776 A:middle
What the iMac cannot do,

00:29:21.776 --> 00:29:23.546 A:middle
unfortunately, is store your

00:29:23.546 --> 00:29:24.866 A:middle
ApplePay card securely.

00:29:25.516 --> 00:29:26.776 A:middle
Which is why you can't do that

00:29:26.806 --> 00:29:29.686 A:middle
on an iMac at the moment.

00:29:29.686 --> 00:29:30.356 A:middle
But an iPhone can.

00:29:31.486 --> 00:29:32.676 A:middle
So when these two start talking

00:29:32.676 --> 00:29:34.556 A:middle
to each other, suddenly payments

00:29:34.556 --> 00:29:35.096 A:middle
are possible.

00:29:35.776 --> 00:29:36.596 A:middle
When you want to buy something

00:29:36.596 --> 00:29:38.196 A:middle
on the iMac, it will tell you to

00:29:38.196 --> 00:29:39.756 A:middle
go to your phone, your phone

00:29:39.756 --> 00:29:41.126 A:middle
will use your securely stored

00:29:41.126 --> 00:29:43.196 A:middle
ApplePay cards, with

00:29:43.196 --> 00:29:44.336 A:middle
authentication with Touch ID,

00:29:44.336 --> 00:29:46.256 A:middle
you confirm the payment, and

00:29:46.256 --> 00:29:47.186 A:middle
you're good to go, the payment

00:29:47.186 --> 00:29:48.526 A:middle
is complete, and you can keep

00:29:48.776 --> 00:29:49.176 A:middle
shopping.

00:29:50.266 --> 00:29:51.396 A:middle
And, this doesn't have to be on

00:29:51.396 --> 00:29:52.726 A:middle
an iPhone, this works on an

00:29:52.726 --> 00:29:56.476 A:middle
iPad, or on a Watch.

00:29:56.686 --> 00:29:57.956 A:middle
What's really important here to

00:29:57.956 --> 00:29:59.916 A:middle
note, is how clear the control

00:29:59.916 --> 00:29:59.983 A:middle
is.

00:30:00.906 --> 00:30:02.476 A:middle
The iMac is clearly telling me

00:30:02.566 --> 00:30:03.456 A:middle
to go to my phone.

00:30:04.086 --> 00:30:06.076 A:middle
On my phone, I get a nice

00:30:06.176 --> 00:30:07.506 A:middle
summary of what I'm going to

00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:07.876 A:middle
purchase.

00:30:08.326 --> 00:30:09.516 A:middle
With Touch ID, I confirm.

00:30:09.936 --> 00:30:10.956 A:middle
The same happens on the Watch

00:30:10.956 --> 00:30:12.166 A:middle
with double click to confirm,

00:30:12.726 --> 00:30:14.076 A:middle
and before I know it, my

00:30:14.146 --> 00:30:15.426 A:middle
purchase is complete, and I can

00:30:15.426 --> 00:30:16.786 A:middle
continue my experience.

00:30:17.426 --> 00:30:20.226 A:middle
So, giving really clear control

00:30:20.226 --> 00:30:21.566 A:middle
is incredibly important when

00:30:21.566 --> 00:30:22.856 A:middle
multiple platforms become

00:30:22.856 --> 00:30:23.356 A:middle
available.

00:30:24.266 --> 00:30:25.546 A:middle
Otherwise, your experience might

00:30:25.546 --> 00:30:27.226 A:middle
become very complicated and

00:30:27.226 --> 00:30:27.596 A:middle
difficult.

00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:30.546 A:middle
And, lastly, let's look at

00:30:30.806 --> 00:30:31.126 A:middle
Keynote.

00:30:32.236 --> 00:30:33.656 A:middle
Keynote is a fantastic app to

00:30:33.656 --> 00:30:35.226 A:middle
make presentations, and also to

00:30:35.226 --> 00:30:35.626 A:middle
give them.

00:30:35.926 --> 00:30:37.906 A:middle
But, one of the downsides of

00:30:37.906 --> 00:30:39.076 A:middle
giving a presentation is that

00:30:39.076 --> 00:30:41.506 A:middle
often, your MacBook is connected

00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:43.156 A:middle
to a display or a projector.

00:30:44.146 --> 00:30:45.596 A:middle
And, so if you want to move

00:30:45.596 --> 00:30:47.586 A:middle
between the slides, you have to

00:30:47.806 --> 00:30:49.066 A:middle
stay behind your MacBook because

00:30:49.066 --> 00:30:50.716 A:middle
the keyboard is the only way to

00:30:50.716 --> 00:30:51.486 A:middle
move between slides.

00:30:52.476 --> 00:30:53.756 A:middle
But when you bring in a phone,

00:30:53.756 --> 00:30:54.866 A:middle
well then, the phone can take

00:30:54.866 --> 00:30:56.666 A:middle
control of what slide is being

00:30:56.666 --> 00:30:59.326 A:middle
shown, and you can freely move

00:30:59.326 --> 00:31:00.386 A:middle
around, because the phone is

00:31:00.386 --> 00:31:01.516 A:middle
light, and easy to carry.

00:31:02.796 --> 00:31:03.856 A:middle
What's important to note about

00:31:03.856 --> 00:31:04.936 A:middle
this experience, is that it's

00:31:04.936 --> 00:31:05.766 A:middle
all optional.

00:31:06.356 --> 00:31:07.696 A:middle
If my phone runs out of battery,

00:31:07.696 --> 00:31:09.486 A:middle
or I forget it, I can still go

00:31:09.486 --> 00:31:11.076 A:middle
back to my MacBook, and use the

00:31:11.076 --> 00:31:12.206 A:middle
keyboard to move between the

00:31:12.206 --> 00:31:12.496 A:middle
slides.

00:31:14.066 --> 00:31:15.786 A:middle
So, making it optional is really

00:31:15.786 --> 00:31:17.736 A:middle
important for multiple devices

00:31:17.736 --> 00:31:18.526 A:middle
in one experience.

00:31:19.246 --> 00:31:22.316 A:middle
So, that's what extending is

00:31:22.316 --> 00:31:22.646 A:middle
about.

00:31:23.546 --> 00:31:24.566 A:middle
We complement different

00:31:24.566 --> 00:31:25.956 A:middle
platforms by combining their

00:31:25.956 --> 00:31:26.586 A:middle
capabilities.

00:31:27.666 --> 00:31:29.726 A:middle
We make clear how to control the

00:31:29.726 --> 00:31:31.606 A:middle
different devices, and we work

00:31:31.606 --> 00:31:32.786 A:middle
toward an optional and

00:31:32.786 --> 00:31:34.126 A:middle
effortless experience.

00:31:34.206 --> 00:31:38.336 A:middle
A really good example is Timber

00:31:38.336 --> 00:31:38.636 A:middle
Tennis.

00:31:39.406 --> 00:31:40.676 A:middle
Games have always really well

00:31:40.676 --> 00:31:42.136 A:middle
understood how multiple

00:31:42.136 --> 00:31:43.306 A:middle
platforms can really create a

00:31:43.306 --> 00:31:44.336 A:middle
magical experience.

00:31:45.166 --> 00:31:46.186 A:middle
This is a great example.

00:31:46.476 --> 00:31:47.876 A:middle
You can play a multiplayer game

00:31:47.876 --> 00:31:49.106 A:middle
with multiple devices if you

00:31:49.106 --> 00:31:49.536 A:middle
have them.

00:31:50.216 --> 00:31:51.186 A:middle
It's completely effortless.

00:31:51.686 --> 00:31:52.996 A:middle
With a simple tap of a button,

00:31:53.026 --> 00:31:54.036 A:middle
you can start a multiplayer

00:31:54.036 --> 00:31:54.376 A:middle
game.

00:31:55.106 --> 00:31:56.476 A:middle
There's very clear control,

00:31:56.726 --> 00:31:58.106 A:middle
because there's only two buttons

00:31:58.106 --> 00:31:59.966 A:middle
on the screen, and it's

00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:00.746 A:middle
completely optional.

00:32:00.886 --> 00:32:02.746 A:middle
You can play with a TV, an

00:32:02.826 --> 00:32:04.836 A:middle
iPhone, or an iPad, or any

00:32:04.836 --> 00:32:06.286 A:middle
combination of that.

00:32:07.806 --> 00:32:09.766 A:middle
And another good example is

00:32:09.766 --> 00:32:10.146 A:middle
Zova.

00:32:11.406 --> 00:32:12.946 A:middle
Zova works really well even if

00:32:12.946 --> 00:32:14.236 A:middle
you only have one device.

00:32:15.586 --> 00:32:17.236 A:middle
If you have an iPad, or an

00:32:17.236 --> 00:32:19.096 A:middle
iPhone, or an Apple TV, you can

00:32:19.096 --> 00:32:21.256 A:middle
start training with Zova, but

00:32:21.256 --> 00:32:22.516 A:middle
the app will always look if

00:32:22.516 --> 00:32:23.526 A:middle
there are more platforms

00:32:23.526 --> 00:32:24.726 A:middle
available in its surroundings.

00:32:25.606 --> 00:32:27.336 A:middle
For example, if you have a

00:32:27.336 --> 00:32:28.816 A:middle
Watch, it will measure your

00:32:28.816 --> 00:32:30.396 A:middle
heartbeat, and that information

00:32:30.396 --> 00:32:31.496 A:middle
is shared amongst all the

00:32:31.496 --> 00:32:32.456 A:middle
devices that you are using.

00:32:32.996 --> 00:32:33.856 A:middle
So, for example, that would

00:32:33.856 --> 00:32:35.406 A:middle
reappear on your TV.

00:32:36.666 --> 00:32:37.786 A:middle
It's a great example of how

00:32:37.786 --> 00:32:38.546 A:middle
effortless this is.

00:32:38.846 --> 00:32:39.826 A:middle
Again, you don't have to do

00:32:39.826 --> 00:32:40.686 A:middle
anything to make this

00:32:40.686 --> 00:32:42.066 A:middle
information being shared across

00:32:42.066 --> 00:32:42.646 A:middle
the devices.

00:32:43.426 --> 00:32:45.296 A:middle
I don't have to tell my Watch to

00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:46.846 A:middle
show my heartbeat on the TV.

00:32:48.006 --> 00:32:49.066 A:middle
And, it's completely optional.

00:32:49.526 --> 00:32:51.076 A:middle
Zova works just as well with one

00:32:51.076 --> 00:32:52.506 A:middle
platform as it does with

00:32:52.506 --> 00:32:53.396 A:middle
multiple platforms.

00:32:54.046 --> 00:32:58.346 A:middle
So, that's the entire process.

00:32:59.336 --> 00:33:00.546 A:middle
We started with selecting our

00:33:00.546 --> 00:33:02.086 A:middle
platform based on the context

00:33:02.086 --> 00:33:03.746 A:middle
and the capabilities of each

00:33:03.746 --> 00:33:04.136 A:middle
platform.

00:33:04.136 --> 00:33:07.616 A:middle
We looked at prioritizing new

00:33:07.616 --> 00:33:08.736 A:middle
and existing features, and

00:33:08.736 --> 00:33:10.026 A:middle
taking advantage of unique

00:33:10.026 --> 00:33:11.746 A:middle
capabilities with adapting.

00:33:13.196 --> 00:33:14.536 A:middle
With conform, we tried to find a

00:33:14.536 --> 00:33:16.056 A:middle
balance between our brand and

00:33:16.056 --> 00:33:16.886 A:middle
the platform guidelines.

00:33:18.386 --> 00:33:19.646 A:middle
In connecting, we looked at what

00:33:19.646 --> 00:33:20.856 A:middle
happens when you go from one

00:33:20.856 --> 00:33:22.716 A:middle
platform to another, and make

00:33:22.716 --> 00:33:23.586 A:middle
that really seamless and

00:33:23.586 --> 00:33:23.966 A:middle
effortless.

00:33:24.996 --> 00:33:26.556 A:middle
And, lastly, we looked at what

00:33:26.556 --> 00:33:28.176 A:middle
magical things can happen when

00:33:28.176 --> 00:33:29.656 A:middle
multiple devices are available

00:33:30.216 --> 00:33:30.916 A:middle
at the same time.

00:33:31.556 --> 00:33:36.076 A:middle
I said in the beginning, we

00:33:36.076 --> 00:33:37.156 A:middle
design our platforms and our

00:33:37.156 --> 00:33:38.626 A:middle
apps to benefit your day-to-day

00:33:38.626 --> 00:33:40.266 A:middle
life, and create a meaningful

00:33:40.266 --> 00:33:40.756 A:middle
relationship.

00:33:41.706 --> 00:33:43.356 A:middle
In the end, we hope that all of

00:33:43.356 --> 00:33:44.976 A:middle
our apps and platforms create a

00:33:44.976 --> 00:33:46.336 A:middle
holistic experience that is

00:33:46.396 --> 00:33:47.486 A:middle
greater than its parts.

00:33:48.916 --> 00:33:49.966 A:middle
With this process we talked

00:33:49.966 --> 00:33:51.416 A:middle
about today, we hope you have

00:33:51.416 --> 00:33:52.876 A:middle
all the tools you need to join

00:33:52.876 --> 00:33:53.836 A:middle
us in that endeavor.

00:33:54.366 --> 00:33:57.556 A:middle
This talk is always available

00:33:57.636 --> 00:33:58.986 A:middle
with this link, and make sure to

00:33:58.986 --> 00:34:00.496 A:middle
check out these sessions too.

00:34:00.496 --> 00:34:01.396 A:middle
There are some really good ones

00:34:01.456 --> 00:34:03.066 A:middle
tomorrow on design as well.

00:34:04.936 --> 00:34:06.016 A:middle
We wish you the best of luck in

00:34:06.016 --> 00:34:07.296 A:middle
bringing your apps to Apple's

00:34:07.296 --> 00:34:07.946 A:middle
ecosystem.

00:34:08.256 --> 00:34:09.366 A:middle
Enjoy the rest of WWDC, and

00:34:09.366 --> 00:34:10.666 A:middle
thank you very much.
