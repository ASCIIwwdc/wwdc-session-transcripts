00:00:07.516 --> 00:00:15.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:23.496 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So what's new on iOS?

00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:27.836 A:middle
For this release, a major theme

00:00:27.836 --> 00:00:28.946 A:middle
has been Wayfinding.

00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:30.966 A:middle
Now Wayfinding traditionally

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.056 A:middle
refers to all the ways that we

00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:34.926 A:middle
can help guide people through an

00:00:34.926 --> 00:00:36.606 A:middle
environment and orient

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:37.806 A:middle
themselves within a physical

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:38.196 A:middle
space.

00:00:39.946 --> 00:00:41.336 A:middle
You encounter signage and

00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:43.136 A:middle
information systems everywhere

00:00:43.136 --> 00:00:45.216 A:middle
to help you find your way from

00:00:45.216 --> 00:00:49.966 A:middle
street signs, to airports, and

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.086 A:middle
even in parking garages.

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:54.026 A:middle
So naturally, our digital

00:00:54.026 --> 00:00:55.646 A:middle
environments can benefit from

00:00:55.646 --> 00:00:56.566 A:middle
clear navigation.

00:00:57.706 --> 00:00:59.806 A:middle
Wayfinding in UI can enhance

00:00:59.806 --> 00:01:01.256 A:middle
your experience and

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:02.456 A:middle
understanding of the space that

00:01:02.456 --> 00:01:02.906 A:middle
you're in.

00:01:04.986 --> 00:01:07.316 A:middle
Now when we design for iOS, our

00:01:07.316 --> 00:01:08.646 A:middle
goal is to highlight content

00:01:08.646 --> 00:01:08.916 A:middle
first.

00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:11.796 A:middle
But app layouts need clear

00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:13.666 A:middle
visual hierarchy so that people

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.966 A:middle
know how to navigate through the

00:01:15.036 --> 00:01:15.396 A:middle
system.

00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:19.466 A:middle
UI elements in general should

00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.416 A:middle
not compete with content but

00:01:21.416 --> 00:01:22.756 A:middle
help you to better understand

00:01:22.756 --> 00:01:24.056 A:middle
potential functions and

00:01:24.056 --> 00:01:24.726 A:middle
interactions.

00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:28.006 A:middle
And we are constantly trying to

00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:29.236 A:middle
improve upon these themes.

00:01:29.716 --> 00:01:32.136 A:middle
So for iOS 11, we wanted to

00:01:32.136 --> 00:01:33.326 A:middle
provide more clarity for

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:34.896 A:middle
navigation or Wayfinding

00:01:35.246 --> 00:01:36.146 A:middle
throughout the system.

00:01:37.746 --> 00:01:39.176 A:middle
We wanted to focus on overall

00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:40.996 A:middle
hierarchy through the use of

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:41.786 A:middle
typography.

00:01:43.346 --> 00:01:45.096 A:middle
And when it would be useful, we

00:01:45.096 --> 00:01:46.306 A:middle
wanted to create greater

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.536 A:middle
contrast by refining elements

00:01:48.536 --> 00:01:49.086 A:middle
within the UI.

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:51.886 A:middle
So first, let's take a look at

00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:52.556 A:middle
navigation.

00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:57.026 A:middle
Last year we started using more

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:59.466 A:middle
bold text in music because it's

00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:00.696 A:middle
an app with a lot of dense

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:01.376 A:middle
content.

00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:04.036 A:middle
Text became instrumental for

00:02:04.036 --> 00:02:06.036 A:middle
organizing similar media and

00:02:06.036 --> 00:02:07.326 A:middle
orienting you while you browse

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:08.036 A:middle
and search.

00:02:08.746 --> 00:02:10.306 A:middle
And we recognize that other apps

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:12.306 A:middle
could benefit from the same text

00:02:12.306 --> 00:02:12.656 A:middle
treatments.

00:02:14.596 --> 00:02:16.496 A:middle
So this year, we introduce large

00:02:16.646 --> 00:02:18.926 A:middle
titles to navigation bars for

00:02:18.926 --> 00:02:20.546 A:middle
other apps that could use some

00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:21.166 A:middle
more emphasis.

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:23.936 A:middle
This does not replace our

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:25.826 A:middle
standard navigation but is an

00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:27.826 A:middle
opt-in version that transitions

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:29.736 A:middle
from to the standard Nav bar

00:02:29.736 --> 00:02:30.946 A:middle
when you start scrolling.

00:02:32.866 --> 00:02:34.646 A:middle
Now you might be wondering where

00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:36.176 A:middle
these large titles should be

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:38.166 A:middle
used and I can highlight a

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:39.746 A:middle
couple guidelines to consider

00:02:40.016 --> 00:02:41.606 A:middle
that we found helpful when

00:02:41.606 --> 00:02:42.996 A:middle
deciding which of our apps

00:02:43.046 --> 00:02:44.336 A:middle
they'd be most appropriate for.

00:02:44.756 --> 00:02:46.456 A:middle
A good place to use large-title

00:02:46.456 --> 00:02:48.406 A:middle
navigation can be at the top

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:50.026 A:middle
level of an app with tabs.

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:52.216 A:middle
This helps to understand that

00:02:52.216 --> 00:02:54.086 A:middle
you're at a top level but also

00:02:54.086 --> 00:02:55.106 A:middle
that you're scrolled to the top

00:02:55.106 --> 00:02:55.856 A:middle
of the page.

00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:59.606 A:middle
Again, music is a good example

00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:01.186 A:middle
of an app that uses large titles

00:03:01.656 --> 00:03:03.916 A:middle
for all of its top levels but

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:06.086 A:middle
also occasionally on some

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:07.756 A:middle
secondary levels or further

00:03:07.756 --> 00:03:08.006 A:middle
down.

00:03:09.246 --> 00:03:11.206 A:middle
Since music has so much content

00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:12.926 A:middle
and multiple levels that you can

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:15.256 A:middle
drill into, large titles are

00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:17.056 A:middle
helpful as you navigate further

00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:17.566 A:middle
into the app.

00:03:20.306 --> 00:03:21.996 A:middle
They can be used for views that

00:03:21.996 --> 00:03:24.006 A:middle
all have very similar layouts as

00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:25.566 A:middle
a quick read on where you are.

00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:28.446 A:middle
Phone is an appropriate app to

00:03:28.446 --> 00:03:30.746 A:middle
use large titles because almost

00:03:30.746 --> 00:03:33.306 A:middle
all of the tabs show content in

00:03:33.306 --> 00:03:33.946 A:middle
rows of text.

00:03:36.046 --> 00:03:37.436 A:middle
And it's important to stress

00:03:37.476 --> 00:03:39.266 A:middle
that it's not always necessary

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:40.706 A:middle
to use large titles in

00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:41.386 A:middle
navigation.

00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:43.206 A:middle
We found that in multiple

00:03:43.276 --> 00:03:44.896 A:middle
scenarios it would hinder

00:03:44.896 --> 00:03:46.326 A:middle
usability and not help.

00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:48.976 A:middle
And a good example of that is

00:03:48.976 --> 00:03:49.656 A:middle
the clock app.

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:52.846 A:middle
Even though it's an app with

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:56.126 A:middle
tabs, it doesn't have multiple

00:03:56.366 --> 00:03:58.926 A:middle
content to sort through and each

00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:00.526 A:middle
of the tabs has a very distinct

00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:01.006 A:middle
layout.

00:04:01.716 --> 00:04:03.186 A:middle
So large titles in this case

00:04:03.646 --> 00:04:04.976 A:middle
would compete with content.

00:04:07.136 --> 00:04:09.006 A:middle
Now let's take a closer look at

00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:09.886 A:middle
ways that we can improve

00:04:09.886 --> 00:04:11.056 A:middle
hierarchy through type.

00:04:12.916 --> 00:04:14.886 A:middle
Typographic hierarchy is the way

00:04:14.886 --> 00:04:16.906 A:middle
to organize type in a way that

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:18.616 A:middle
will emphasize important content

00:04:18.936 --> 00:04:21.286 A:middle
over less important content and

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:22.466 A:middle
it can help to group things

00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:22.876 A:middle
together.

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:25.596 A:middle
This can reduce cognitive load

00:04:25.596 --> 00:04:27.316 A:middle
or the amount of mental effort

00:04:27.526 --> 00:04:28.966 A:middle
it takes you to find something

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:29.766 A:middle
that you're looking for.

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:32.576 A:middle
And there are a few basic

00:04:32.576 --> 00:04:33.876 A:middle
methods for establishing

00:04:33.956 --> 00:04:35.056 A:middle
typographic hierarchy.

00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:40.856 A:middle
The position of the text can

00:04:40.856 --> 00:04:41.806 A:middle
convey importance.

00:04:42.506 --> 00:04:45.006 A:middle
Since Label 1 is on top, we can

00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:46.586 A:middle
infer that it's more important

00:04:46.756 --> 00:04:48.926 A:middle
than Label 2, but that might not

00:04:48.926 --> 00:04:50.326 A:middle
be obvious in all cases.

00:04:50.866 --> 00:04:52.336 A:middle
So another way is to decrease

00:04:52.386 --> 00:04:54.926 A:middle
the size of the secondary line

00:04:54.926 --> 00:04:57.876 A:middle
or you can vary the weight or

00:04:57.876 --> 00:04:59.076 A:middle
you can use color so that the

00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:00.556 A:middle
secondary line recedes more.

00:05:01.506 --> 00:05:03.696 A:middle
You may need to use more than

00:05:03.696 --> 00:05:06.226 A:middle
one of these at a time so you

00:05:06.226 --> 00:05:07.276 A:middle
can make sure there's clear

00:05:07.326 --> 00:05:09.316 A:middle
hierarchy between the two.

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:12.456 A:middle
Here's a screen from photos in

00:05:12.626 --> 00:05:12.846 A:middle
iOS 10.

00:05:14.446 --> 00:05:16.156 A:middle
The most important information

00:05:16.156 --> 00:05:17.706 A:middle
here is your content, your

00:05:17.796 --> 00:05:18.216 A:middle
photos.

00:05:19.046 --> 00:05:21.526 A:middle
The section headers use two text

00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:22.886 A:middle
sizes to distinguish different

00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:24.866 A:middle
information but all of it is a

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.196 A:middle
tad small and light.

00:05:27.736 --> 00:05:30.236 A:middle
So for iOS 11, we made section

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:32.416 A:middle
headers larger in general and

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:34.316 A:middle
increased the text weight and

00:05:34.506 --> 00:05:36.386 A:middle
used gray for supporting text.

00:05:37.316 --> 00:05:39.786 A:middle
And these changes made it easier

00:05:39.786 --> 00:05:41.606 A:middle
to isolate important in content

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.056 A:middle
so that you can find a

00:05:43.056 --> 00:05:44.596 A:middle
particular photo faster.

00:05:45.496 --> 00:05:46.826 A:middle
So let's look at more examples.

00:05:47.956 --> 00:05:49.676 A:middle
Here's Calendar in iOS 10.

00:05:51.376 --> 00:05:53.346 A:middle
We increased text weights for

00:05:53.346 --> 00:05:55.236 A:middle
more emphasis and used color

00:05:55.236 --> 00:05:57.376 A:middle
more intentionally to denote the

00:05:57.376 --> 00:05:59.506 A:middle
current year, month, and date.

00:06:01.516 --> 00:06:04.606 A:middle
Here is Weather in iOS 10.

00:06:06.016 --> 00:06:08.066 A:middle
For iOS 11, we increased the

00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:10.796 A:middle
text weights and made the text

00:06:10.796 --> 00:06:12.586 A:middle
overall larger so that the

00:06:12.586 --> 00:06:16.226 A:middle
content is easier to read.

00:06:16.226 --> 00:06:18.016 A:middle
So last, let's look at ways that

00:06:18.016 --> 00:06:19.926 A:middle
we've tried to improve contrast.

00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:23.316 A:middle
To create more balance with the

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:25.416 A:middle
larger and more bold text styles

00:06:25.516 --> 00:06:27.196 A:middle
throughout the UI, we needed to

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:29.406 A:middle
update other UI elements to give

00:06:29.406 --> 00:06:31.196 A:middle
them greater contrast while

00:06:31.196 --> 00:06:32.646 A:middle
keeping them both functional and

00:06:32.646 --> 00:06:33.036 A:middle
minimal.

00:06:33.576 --> 00:06:34.626 A:middle
So one of the ways we did this

00:06:34.876 --> 00:06:37.036 A:middle
was to fill in the button shapes

00:06:38.446 --> 00:06:39.796 A:middle
and increase the size of the

00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:42.026 A:middle
shape itself like we did with

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:42.806 A:middle
the search field.

00:06:44.346 --> 00:06:46.306 A:middle
And we updated the tab bars

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.346 A:middle
increasing the weight of the

00:06:48.476 --> 00:06:51.466 A:middle
label from regular to medium.

00:06:52.256 --> 00:06:54.056 A:middle
And for the glyphs, we filled in

00:06:54.056 --> 00:06:55.366 A:middle
the shapes and thickened the

00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:56.046 A:middle
stroke weights.

00:06:58.066 --> 00:06:59.926 A:middle
And to make better use of space

00:06:59.976 --> 00:07:02.326 A:middle
in landscape, we moved the label

00:07:02.386 --> 00:07:03.506 A:middle
so that it's side by side with

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:03.856 A:middle
the glyph.

00:07:04.806 --> 00:07:06.386 A:middle
This tab bar is now shorter than

00:07:06.386 --> 00:07:08.256 A:middle
before and now matches the

00:07:08.256 --> 00:07:10.106 A:middle
landscape Nav bar and toolbar

00:07:10.106 --> 00:07:10.336 A:middle
height.

00:07:10.336 --> 00:07:14.126 A:middle
And a couple other things to

00:07:14.126 --> 00:07:15.726 A:middle
note are that the glyphs are

00:07:15.846 --> 00:07:17.496 A:middle
slightly smaller and the text is

00:07:17.586 --> 00:07:19.106 A:middle
slightly larger than the

00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:20.006 A:middle
portrait equivalents.

00:07:20.066 --> 00:07:21.396 A:middle
So you'll want to make sure you

00:07:21.396 --> 00:07:23.036 A:middle
take that into account for your

00:07:23.036 --> 00:07:24.556 A:middle
own apps.

00:07:26.356 --> 00:07:27.936 A:middle
On iPad, we can increase the

00:07:27.936 --> 00:07:29.626 A:middle
text size even more while

00:07:29.626 --> 00:07:31.146 A:middle
keeping the glyphs the same as

00:07:31.236 --> 00:07:31.666 A:middle
portrait.

00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:35.636 A:middle
This is the Wallet app from iOS

00:07:37.086 --> 00:07:37.426 A:middle
10.

00:07:37.426 --> 00:07:39.116 A:middle
And typically we use material

00:07:39.116 --> 00:07:41.846 A:middle
blurs to indicate when UI has

00:07:41.846 --> 00:07:44.116 A:middle
come in on top of a page that is

00:07:44.176 --> 00:07:44.876 A:middle
still underneath.

00:07:46.136 --> 00:07:47.426 A:middle
And we wanted to remove it in

00:07:47.426 --> 00:07:49.226 A:middle
areas, like in this example,

00:07:49.506 --> 00:07:50.806 A:middle
where it had no logical reason

00:07:50.806 --> 00:07:52.546 A:middle
for being there and did not

00:07:52.546 --> 00:07:54.066 A:middle
reinforce where you are in the

00:07:54.066 --> 00:07:54.846 A:middle
digital space.

00:07:57.496 --> 00:07:58.996 A:middle
So that's a quick summary of the

00:07:58.996 --> 00:08:00.246 A:middle
design updates we've made for

00:08:00.456 --> 00:08:01.296 A:middle
iOS 11.

00:08:01.786 --> 00:08:03.266 A:middle
Keep these things in mind when

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:05.146 A:middle
making and updating your apps.

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:08.236 A:middle
Use large-title navigation if

00:08:08.236 --> 00:08:09.966 A:middle
areas of your app could use more

00:08:10.036 --> 00:08:12.366 A:middle
emphasis and to help orient

00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:12.736 A:middle
people.

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.356 A:middle
But remember that it's not

00:08:14.356 --> 00:08:15.896 A:middle
always necessary to use

00:08:15.966 --> 00:08:16.446 A:middle
everywhere.

00:08:17.846 --> 00:08:19.566 A:middle
Consider whether your app could

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:20.956 A:middle
benefit from refining

00:08:21.026 --> 00:08:22.156 A:middle
typographic hierarchy.

00:08:23.226 --> 00:08:25.556 A:middle
And lastly, remove superfluous

00:08:25.556 --> 00:08:28.096 A:middle
UI elements and complexity to

00:08:28.096 --> 00:08:30.036 A:middle
improve overall contrast in your

00:08:31.496 --> 00:08:31.576 A:middle
app.

00:08:31.646 --> 00:08:33.006 A:middle
We hope these updates will help

00:08:33.006 --> 00:08:34.046 A:middle
you to create great products

00:08:34.686 --> 00:08:36.356 A:middle
that are both beautiful and easy

00:08:36.356 --> 00:08:36.686 A:middle
to use.

00:08:37.286 --> 00:08:37.716 A:middle
Thank you
