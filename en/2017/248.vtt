00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:31.046 A:middle
Localization Best Practices on

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:31.696 A:middle
tvOS.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.776 A:middle
My name is Joaquim Lobo Silva,

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:35.116 A:middle
and over the next few minutes,

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:35.996 A:middle
I'm going to walk you through

00:00:35.996 --> 00:00:37.276 A:middle
some of the steps you'll want to

00:00:37.276 --> 00:00:38.806 A:middle
take to build a great localized

00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:40.926 A:middle
application experience on tvOS.

00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:44.116 A:middle
Apple TV is available in

00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:45.536 A:middle
multiple languages and regions.

00:00:45.776 --> 00:00:47.566 A:middle
And new in tvOS 11, is the

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.096 A:middle
addition of Arabic and Hebrew

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.676 A:middle
and selectable system languages.

00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:52.996 A:middle
Adding international support to

00:00:52.996 --> 00:00:54.136 A:middle
your app, is an incredible

00:00:54.136 --> 00:00:55.836 A:middle
opportunity to reach new markets

00:00:55.926 --> 00:00:58.016 A:middle
and enable more users to use and

00:00:58.016 --> 00:00:58.866 A:middle
enjoy your content.

00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:00.956 A:middle
And we have a wide variety of

00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:02.456 A:middle
APIs and tools to help you do

00:01:02.456 --> 00:01:02.966 A:middle
just that.

00:01:03.526 --> 00:01:04.136 A:middle
Let's dive right in.

00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:08.246 A:middle
I'm going to divide this topic

00:01:08.246 --> 00:01:09.546 A:middle
into three different sections.

00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:11.286 A:middle
First, I'll talk about best

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:13.076 A:middle
practices on how to handle text

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:14.386 A:middle
that is displayed to your user.

00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:16.116 A:middle
Then, I'll cover some

00:01:16.116 --> 00:01:17.646 A:middle
considerations regarding layout

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:18.386 A:middle
and images.

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:20.586 A:middle
And finally, the steps needed to

00:01:20.586 --> 00:01:22.136 A:middle
export your localizable content,

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.646 A:middle
as well as test your app, to

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:24.586 A:middle
make sure it all works.

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:27.066 A:middle
So, let's get started with text.

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:30.366 A:middle
Any text that will be presented

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.286 A:middle
to your user, should be

00:01:31.286 --> 00:01:32.516 A:middle
displayed in their preferred

00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:33.026 A:middle
language.

00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:35.556 A:middle
If you have text in Storyboard

00:01:35.556 --> 00:01:36.946 A:middle
elements, there's nothing else

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:37.426 A:middle
you need to do.

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:39.136 A:middle
These are marked "localizable"

00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:39.706 A:middle
by default.

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:42.856 A:middle
If you have strings and code

00:01:42.906 --> 00:01:43.636 A:middle
that you're planning on

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.036 A:middle
presenting, these should be

00:01:45.036 --> 00:01:46.086 A:middle
wrapped with a call to

00:01:46.086 --> 00:01:47.166 A:middle
"NSLocalizedString."

00:01:47.646 --> 00:01:48.776 A:middle
This will essentially mark your

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:50.516 A:middle
string as "localizable," so that

00:01:50.516 --> 00:01:51.776 A:middle
it is included in the file that

00:01:51.776 --> 00:01:52.566 A:middle
you will send out for

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:53.166 A:middle
translation.

00:01:54.616 --> 00:01:56.486 A:middle
In both of these cases, comments

00:01:56.486 --> 00:01:57.816 A:middle
on the strings themselves, are

00:01:57.816 --> 00:01:59.576 A:middle
extremely useful, and should be

00:01:59.576 --> 00:02:00.736 A:middle
included as part of every

00:02:00.736 --> 00:02:02.256 A:middle
localizable string in your app.

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:04.166 A:middle
Comments can be the defining

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.806 A:middle
factor between great translated

00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:07.536 A:middle
content and text that feels

00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:09.066 A:middle
unnatural or unclear.

00:02:11.416 --> 00:02:12.806 A:middle
Here's an example of a localized

00:02:12.806 --> 00:02:13.466 A:middle
string in code.

00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:15.246 A:middle
As you can see, this is simply

00:02:15.246 --> 00:02:16.576 A:middle
the English word "subscribe"

00:02:16.976 --> 00:02:18.196 A:middle
with a comment describing where

00:02:18.196 --> 00:02:20.036 A:middle
it will appear in my UI, as well

00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:21.066 A:middle
as what it does within the

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:22.066 A:middle
context of my app.

00:02:25.206 --> 00:02:26.856 A:middle
Comments are just as easy to add

00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:28.186 A:middle
to Storyboard elements as well.

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:29.876 A:middle
For every element, you can

00:02:29.876 --> 00:02:31.326 A:middle
simply add a comment in the

00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:32.846 A:middle
Comment for Localizer text

00:02:32.846 --> 00:02:34.016 A:middle
field, in the Identity

00:02:34.016 --> 00:02:34.526 A:middle
Inspector.

00:02:37.946 --> 00:02:39.016 A:middle
Do note that when it comes to

00:02:39.016 --> 00:02:40.456 A:middle
displaying text in your app,

00:02:40.686 --> 00:02:41.776 A:middle
localized strings are not the

00:02:41.776 --> 00:02:43.166 A:middle
only way to accomplish this.

00:02:43.716 --> 00:02:45.166 A:middle
In fact, it's very likely that

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:46.546 A:middle
you have a number of use cases

00:02:46.616 --> 00:02:47.416 A:middle
that are covered by our

00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:48.446 A:middle
formatted classes.

00:02:49.296 --> 00:02:50.516 A:middle
These help you format and

00:02:50.516 --> 00:02:51.936 A:middle
display things like numbers,

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:54.436 A:middle
currencies, dates, units such as

00:02:54.436 --> 00:02:56.146 A:middle
length and mass, and much more,

00:02:56.516 --> 00:02:57.676 A:middle
without having to write out

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:58.936 A:middle
localized strings for these.

00:03:01.646 --> 00:03:02.766 A:middle
Here's an example of date

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:03.706 A:middle
formatted usage.

00:03:04.276 --> 00:03:06.126 A:middle
I simply create the object, and

00:03:06.126 --> 00:03:07.366 A:middle
in this case, I only care about

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:09.426 A:middle
showing time, so I set the Time

00:03:09.426 --> 00:03:10.806 A:middle
Style to a length value of my

00:03:10.806 --> 00:03:12.806 A:middle
preference, and finally get a

00:03:12.806 --> 00:03:14.266 A:middle
formatted string out of the

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:14.706 A:middle
object.

00:03:15.676 --> 00:03:17.076 A:middle
This string is guaranteed to not

00:03:17.076 --> 00:03:18.406 A:middle
only be in the user's preferred

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:20.216 A:middle
language, but it also takes care

00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:21.536 A:middle
of a number of other formatting

00:03:21.536 --> 00:03:22.986 A:middle
contexts, such as whether the

00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:25.606 A:middle
user prefers 12 or 24-hour time.

00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:29.376 A:middle
For much more information on how

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:30.256 A:middle
to make the most out of

00:03:30.256 --> 00:03:31.616 A:middle
formatters, as well as some

00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:32.916 A:middle
guidance on their international

00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:34.786 A:middle
prowess, I highly recommend you

00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:36.116 A:middle
check out these two talks from

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:36.906 A:middle
2016.

00:03:40.796 --> 00:03:42.126 A:middle
Let's talk about remote content.

00:03:43.346 --> 00:03:44.566 A:middle
Any text that you're fetching

00:03:44.566 --> 00:03:46.256 A:middle
from a server, should also match

00:03:46.256 --> 00:03:47.596 A:middle
your app's running language.

00:03:48.536 --> 00:03:49.996 A:middle
I'm referring to, for example,

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:51.646 A:middle
media content and descriptions

00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:52.736 A:middle
that are shown in your app.

00:03:53.056 --> 00:03:56.436 A:middle
For this to happen, you'll need

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:57.736 A:middle
to inform your server what

00:03:57.736 --> 00:03:58.786 A:middle
language the content should

00:03:58.786 --> 00:04:00.326 A:middle
actually be in.

00:04:02.226 --> 00:04:03.616 A:middle
We have APIs that let you know

00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:04.636 A:middle
what language you're app is

00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:06.056 A:middle
currently running in, and these

00:04:06.056 --> 00:04:07.356 A:middle
do a lot of the heavy lifting in

00:04:07.356 --> 00:04:08.476 A:middle
terms of choosing the best

00:04:08.476 --> 00:04:09.686 A:middle
language out of the ones that

00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:11.496 A:middle
you support, while respecting

00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:12.496 A:middle
the user's preferences.

00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:15.696 A:middle
Things like regional variance

00:04:15.696 --> 00:04:16.876 A:middle
and any appropriate regional

00:04:16.876 --> 00:04:18.446 A:middle
fallbacks, are also considered.

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:22.906 A:middle
Just to give a few small

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:24.636 A:middle
examples, I have here a table

00:04:24.636 --> 00:04:25.836 A:middle
where the first column shows a

00:04:25.836 --> 00:04:27.126 A:middle
language that the user might

00:04:27.126 --> 00:04:27.966 A:middle
have picked for their system

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:28.486 A:middle
language.

00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:29.916 A:middle
The second column shows

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:31.146 A:middle
potential languages that your

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.166 A:middle
application supports, and the

00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:34.336 A:middle
third column would be the end

00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:35.976 A:middle
result, given the circumstances.

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:38.226 A:middle
For the first example, the user

00:04:38.226 --> 00:04:39.486 A:middle
has picked Spanish as their

00:04:39.486 --> 00:04:41.086 A:middle
language, with their region set

00:04:41.086 --> 00:04:43.846 A:middle
to Mexico, hence the "es-MX"

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:44.426 A:middle
identifier.

00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:48.236 A:middle
The app supports both Spanish

00:04:48.236 --> 00:04:49.426 A:middle
for Spain, as well as Latin

00:04:49.426 --> 00:04:50.836 A:middle
American Spanish and the list of

00:04:50.836 --> 00:04:53.536 A:middle
localizations, that's "es-EX"

00:04:53.606 --> 00:04:55.936 A:middle
and "es-419" respectively.

00:04:56.946 --> 00:04:58.116 A:middle
And the runtime will go ahead

00:04:58.116 --> 00:04:59.276 A:middle
and pick the Latin American

00:04:59.276 --> 00:05:00.796 A:middle
Spanish variant for your app.

00:05:02.896 --> 00:05:04.036 A:middle
Similarly, for the second

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:05.516 A:middle
example, the user has picked

00:05:05.516 --> 00:05:06.956 A:middle
Chinese with the region set to

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:08.826 A:middle
China, and Bundle will go ahead

00:05:08.826 --> 00:05:10.356 A:middle
and pick "Simplified Chinese"

00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:11.586 A:middle
out of the languages that your

00:05:11.586 --> 00:05:12.256 A:middle
app supports.

00:05:16.706 --> 00:05:17.656 A:middle
To get the language that your

00:05:17.656 --> 00:05:19.166 A:middle
app is running in, all you have

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:20.756 A:middle
to do is get the first object of

00:05:20.756 --> 00:05:22.316 A:middle
preferred localizations from

00:05:22.316 --> 00:05:22.986 A:middle
your app's bundle.

00:05:24.176 --> 00:05:25.236 A:middle
This will return a language

00:05:25.236 --> 00:05:26.426 A:middle
identifier that you can send to

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:26.906 A:middle
your server.

00:05:28.516 --> 00:05:30.236 A:middle
Alternatively, if your server

00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:31.336 A:middle
supports a different set of

00:05:31.336 --> 00:05:32.756 A:middle
languages relative to your app,

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:34.426 A:middle
you can also get the best

00:05:34.426 --> 00:05:35.776 A:middle
possible language match out of

00:05:35.776 --> 00:05:37.876 A:middle
those, using Bundle's Preferred

00:05:37.876 --> 00:05:39.576 A:middle
Localizations from Available.

00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:42.806 A:middle
So, that's an overview of how to

00:05:42.806 --> 00:05:43.906 A:middle
handle text in your app.

00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:45.456 A:middle
Text can be marked as

00:05:45.456 --> 00:05:46.566 A:middle
localizable through using

00:05:46.566 --> 00:05:48.256 A:middle
Storyboards, as well as calling

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:49.626 A:middle
NSLocalizedString and code.

00:05:50.426 --> 00:05:51.696 A:middle
We have a number of formatters

00:05:51.696 --> 00:05:52.736 A:middle
that help display and

00:05:52.736 --> 00:05:54.416 A:middle
contextualize information, like

00:05:54.456 --> 00:05:55.276 A:middle
dates and numbers.

00:05:55.806 --> 00:05:57.366 A:middle
For remote content, you can rely

00:05:57.366 --> 00:05:59.016 A:middle
on the Bundle API to help inform

00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:00.186 A:middle
your server what language your

00:06:00.186 --> 00:06:03.746 A:middle
content should be displayed in.

00:06:03.746 --> 00:06:05.186 A:middle
With that, let's talk a little

00:06:05.186 --> 00:06:06.426 A:middle
about layout and images.

00:06:09.776 --> 00:06:11.046 A:middle
When it comes to layout, there

00:06:11.046 --> 00:06:12.106 A:middle
are typically two different

00:06:12.106 --> 00:06:13.486 A:middle
aspects to adapt for.

00:06:14.846 --> 00:06:16.066 A:middle
The first one is potential

00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:17.436 A:middle
differences in word length.

00:06:18.366 --> 00:06:19.506 A:middle
For example, here's the word

00:06:19.506 --> 00:06:21.756 A:middle
"backup" in English, and here's

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.276 A:middle
that same word in Finnish.

00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:25.836 A:middle
Translations being significantly

00:06:25.836 --> 00:06:27.676 A:middle
longer or shorter, can impact

00:06:27.676 --> 00:06:28.906 A:middle
the way your layout behaves at

00:06:28.906 --> 00:06:30.396 A:middle
runtime, and you should design

00:06:30.396 --> 00:06:31.246 A:middle
for this accordingly.

00:06:32.906 --> 00:06:34.296 A:middle
The other aspect is script

00:06:34.296 --> 00:06:35.016 A:middle
directionality.

00:06:36.116 --> 00:06:37.586 A:middle
English uses the Latin alphabet,

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:39.246 A:middle
which is read and parsed from

00:06:39.246 --> 00:06:39.976 A:middle
left to right.

00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:43.356 A:middle
Some languages like Arabic, have

00:06:43.356 --> 00:06:44.646 A:middle
their scripts read from right to

00:06:44.646 --> 00:06:44.946 A:middle
left.

00:06:45.616 --> 00:06:47.266 A:middle
As a result, there are a number

00:06:47.266 --> 00:06:48.566 A:middle
of design considerations

00:06:48.566 --> 00:06:50.126 A:middle
regarding flow and ordering of

00:06:50.126 --> 00:06:50.746 A:middle
information.

00:06:51.526 --> 00:06:52.836 A:middle
For example, in a right to left

00:06:52.836 --> 00:06:54.366 A:middle
language, the first item in a

00:06:54.366 --> 00:06:55.626 A:middle
list is expected to be in the

00:06:55.626 --> 00:06:57.136 A:middle
far right, as opposed to the far

00:06:57.136 --> 00:06:57.526 A:middle
left.

00:06:59.676 --> 00:07:01.066 A:middle
If your app uses UIKit to

00:07:01.066 --> 00:07:02.536 A:middle
display user interface elements,

00:07:02.836 --> 00:07:03.906 A:middle
there are a few technologies

00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:05.496 A:middle
that you can use to easily adapt

00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:06.916 A:middle
for these two different aspects.

00:07:07.506 --> 00:07:08.746 A:middle
It's highly recommended that you

00:07:08.746 --> 00:07:09.886 A:middle
start off with exploring

00:07:09.886 --> 00:07:10.686 A:middle
UIStackView.

00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:12.966 A:middle
UIStackView is a streamlined

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:14.126 A:middle
interface for laying out a

00:07:14.126 --> 00:07:15.596 A:middle
series of views, either

00:07:15.596 --> 00:07:16.846 A:middle
horizontally or vertically.

00:07:17.196 --> 00:07:18.336 A:middle
And these can be nested to

00:07:18.336 --> 00:07:20.156 A:middle
create complex layouts as shown

00:07:20.156 --> 00:07:20.456 A:middle
here.

00:07:20.456 --> 00:07:23.386 A:middle
In this example, you can see

00:07:23.386 --> 00:07:24.636 A:middle
that I have some numbered views,

00:07:25.406 --> 00:07:26.416 A:middle
and the general flow of

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:27.766 A:middle
information here is left to

00:07:27.766 --> 00:07:28.986 A:middle
right, as expected for a

00:07:28.986 --> 00:07:29.966 A:middle
language like English.

00:07:32.096 --> 00:07:33.596 A:middle
The thing about UIStackView is

00:07:33.596 --> 00:07:35.156 A:middle
that under the hood, it relies

00:07:35.156 --> 00:07:36.616 A:middle
on something called Auto Layout.

00:07:37.886 --> 00:07:39.476 A:middle
Auto Layout is a set of APIs

00:07:39.476 --> 00:07:40.576 A:middle
that help determine layout

00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:42.196 A:middle
relationships between views,

00:07:42.546 --> 00:07:44.086 A:middle
such that if the size of a view

00:07:44.086 --> 00:07:45.996 A:middle
changes, other views can adapt

00:07:45.996 --> 00:07:47.546 A:middle
accordingly to prevent overlap

00:07:47.546 --> 00:07:48.176 A:middle
or truncation.

00:07:49.316 --> 00:07:51.496 A:middle
In addition to this, Auto Layout

00:07:51.496 --> 00:07:52.826 A:middle
also relies on the concept of

00:07:52.886 --> 00:07:53.816 A:middle
leading and trailing

00:07:53.816 --> 00:07:54.406 A:middle
constraints.

00:07:55.056 --> 00:07:56.526 A:middle
These are essentially left and

00:07:56.526 --> 00:07:58.306 A:middle
right position constraints, but

00:07:58.306 --> 00:07:59.846 A:middle
that evaluate to right and left

00:08:00.026 --> 00:08:01.126 A:middle
when running in a right to left

00:08:01.126 --> 00:08:01.586 A:middle
language.

00:08:02.066 --> 00:08:03.716 A:middle
So, for the stack views above,

00:08:04.846 --> 00:08:06.316 A:middle
the layout would automatically

00:08:06.316 --> 00:08:07.776 A:middle
change to right to left, when

00:08:07.776 --> 00:08:09.456 A:middle
running in, for example, Arabic

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:09.986 A:middle
or Hebrew.

00:08:09.986 --> 00:08:12.976 A:middle
And this can be accomplished

00:08:12.976 --> 00:08:14.246 A:middle
without having to write a single

00:08:14.246 --> 00:08:15.636 A:middle
line of extra code for different

00:08:15.636 --> 00:08:16.506 A:middle
layout environments.

00:08:19.256 --> 00:08:21.066 A:middle
For apps using TVMLKit, the

00:08:21.066 --> 00:08:22.456 A:middle
standard templates provided do

00:08:22.456 --> 00:08:23.636 A:middle
all the heavy lifting for the

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:24.706 A:middle
two aspects I mentioned.

00:08:26.086 --> 00:08:27.526 A:middle
In particular for right to left

00:08:27.526 --> 00:08:29.216 A:middle
languages, once again, with the

00:08:29.216 --> 00:08:30.736 A:middle
addition of Arabic and Hebrew

00:08:30.736 --> 00:08:32.316 A:middle
and selectable system languages,

00:08:33.036 --> 00:08:34.196 A:middle
we have some new APIs that

00:08:34.196 --> 00:08:35.656 A:middle
leverage the same concept of

00:08:35.656 --> 00:08:37.606 A:middle
leading and trailing for TVMLKit

00:08:37.606 --> 00:08:38.846 A:middle
elements that have a specific

00:08:38.846 --> 00:08:40.286 A:middle
position or alignment.

00:08:42.346 --> 00:08:43.676 A:middle
Similarly, for margins and

00:08:43.676 --> 00:08:45.176 A:middle
padding, we have new media

00:08:45.176 --> 00:08:46.776 A:middle
queries to help specify custom

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.406 A:middle
values for a specific layout

00:08:48.406 --> 00:08:48.866 A:middle
direction.

00:08:51.716 --> 00:08:53.186 A:middle
To explore these new features in

00:08:53.186 --> 00:08:54.686 A:middle
depth, please be sure to check

00:08:54.686 --> 00:08:56.406 A:middle
out Advances in TVMLKit.

00:08:59.236 --> 00:09:00.296 A:middle
Let's move on to images.

00:09:00.566 --> 00:09:01.726 A:middle
And for this, I'm going to

00:09:01.726 --> 00:09:02.916 A:middle
briefly cover an approach to

00:09:02.916 --> 00:09:04.096 A:middle
keep in mind for different

00:09:04.096 --> 00:09:04.866 A:middle
layout directions.

00:09:05.756 --> 00:09:07.146 A:middle
Typically, images in your app

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:08.356 A:middle
will fall into one of three

00:09:08.356 --> 00:09:09.216 A:middle
separate buckets.

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:12.046 A:middle
The first one, likely to be most

00:09:12.046 --> 00:09:13.526 A:middle
of your images, is universal.

00:09:13.996 --> 00:09:15.166 A:middle
These are images that do not

00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:16.826 A:middle
need specific adaptation for a

00:09:16.826 --> 00:09:17.566 A:middle
layout direction.

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.446 A:middle
The second category, is images

00:09:21.446 --> 00:09:22.866 A:middle
that do have some direction

00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:23.826 A:middle
associated to them.

00:09:24.486 --> 00:09:25.786 A:middle
This can be a number of things

00:09:25.786 --> 00:09:27.186 A:middle
such as navigation arrows,

00:09:27.346 --> 00:09:29.106 A:middle
disclosure indicators, or in

00:09:29.106 --> 00:09:30.546 A:middle
this case, a simplified

00:09:30.546 --> 00:09:31.796 A:middle
representation of text.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.306 A:middle
The only step required for these

00:09:34.306 --> 00:09:36.056 A:middle
images to adapt for the opposite

00:09:36.056 --> 00:09:37.556 A:middle
layout direction, is to

00:09:37.556 --> 00:09:38.586 A:middle
graphically mirror them.

00:09:38.876 --> 00:09:40.056 A:middle
And now, we have the correct

00:09:40.056 --> 00:09:40.366 A:middle
result.

00:09:42.776 --> 00:09:44.576 A:middle
Lastly, the third category is

00:09:44.576 --> 00:09:46.126 A:middle
similar to the second, but these

00:09:46.126 --> 00:09:47.786 A:middle
are relatively complex such that

00:09:47.786 --> 00:09:49.036 A:middle
simply flipping them would

00:09:49.036 --> 00:09:50.496 A:middle
actually produce an incorrect

00:09:50.496 --> 00:09:50.866 A:middle
result.

00:09:52.036 --> 00:09:53.646 A:middle
In this example, I've a bulleted

00:09:53.646 --> 00:09:55.256 A:middle
list with checkmarks, but

00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:56.516 A:middle
checkmarks as a symbol should

00:09:56.516 --> 00:09:57.276 A:middle
not be mirrored.

00:09:59.006 --> 00:10:00.576 A:middle
So, in this case, what I really

00:10:00.576 --> 00:10:02.526 A:middle
need is two separate images, one

00:10:02.526 --> 00:10:03.576 A:middle
for each layout direction.

00:10:06.216 --> 00:10:07.626 A:middle
Xcode makes it very easy to

00:10:07.626 --> 00:10:09.306 A:middle
handle all of these cases, right

00:10:09.306 --> 00:10:10.686 A:middle
from within your Asset Catalog.

00:10:11.276 --> 00:10:12.936 A:middle
For each asset, you can specify

00:10:12.936 --> 00:10:14.166 A:middle
whether or not an image has a

00:10:14.166 --> 00:10:15.736 A:middle
fixed direction or if it should

00:10:15.736 --> 00:10:17.496 A:middle
adapt either through mirroring

00:10:17.526 --> 00:10:18.826 A:middle
or through specifying different

00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:19.286 A:middle
images.

00:10:19.736 --> 00:10:21.086 A:middle
Then, it's simply a matter of

00:10:21.086 --> 00:10:22.816 A:middle
using images regularly either in

00:10:22.816 --> 00:10:24.956 A:middle
code or in Interface Builder, as

00:10:24.956 --> 00:10:25.236 A:middle
usual.

00:10:27.976 --> 00:10:29.416 A:middle
For much more information on how

00:10:29.416 --> 00:10:30.626 A:middle
to use asset catalogs for

00:10:30.626 --> 00:10:31.746 A:middle
different layout directions,

00:10:32.096 --> 00:10:33.286 A:middle
please check out this talk from

00:10:33.286 --> 00:10:34.206 A:middle
2016.

00:10:37.376 --> 00:10:38.696 A:middle
So, that's layout and images.

00:10:39.146 --> 00:10:40.716 A:middle
We've seen how both UIKit and

00:10:40.716 --> 00:10:42.336 A:middle
TVMLKit have very high-level

00:10:42.336 --> 00:10:43.836 A:middle
approaches for adaptive layouts,

00:10:43.956 --> 00:10:46.076 A:middle
as well as some of the new APIs

00:10:46.076 --> 00:10:48.086 A:middle
introduced in tvOS 11 for right

00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:48.716 A:middle
to left support.

00:10:49.596 --> 00:10:50.956 A:middle
And also, the concept of image

00:10:50.956 --> 00:10:52.436 A:middle
directionality and how this is

00:10:52.436 --> 00:10:53.576 A:middle
part of image assets.

00:10:55.906 --> 00:10:57.526 A:middle
Last but not least, let's cover

00:10:57.526 --> 00:10:58.556 A:middle
how you can actually add a

00:10:58.556 --> 00:11:00.006 A:middle
language to your app, from start

00:11:00.006 --> 00:11:00.486 A:middle
to finish.

00:11:03.346 --> 00:11:04.286 A:middle
Adding a language to your

00:11:04.286 --> 00:11:05.916 A:middle
project is done in the Project

00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:06.256 A:middle
Editor.

00:11:06.786 --> 00:11:08.086 A:middle
Select your project file from

00:11:08.086 --> 00:11:09.866 A:middle
within Xcode, and in the Project

00:11:09.866 --> 00:11:11.836 A:middle
Settings, you can add supported

00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:13.406 A:middle
languages in the Localization

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:14.046 A:middle
section.

00:11:15.556 --> 00:11:17.246 A:middle
Xcode will manage and keep track

00:11:17.246 --> 00:11:18.386 A:middle
of any applicable file

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.956 A:middle
management, such as extracting

00:11:19.956 --> 00:11:21.726 A:middle
text from Storyboards, as well

00:11:21.726 --> 00:11:22.806 A:middle
as strings you've marked as

00:11:22.806 --> 00:11:23.966 A:middle
localizable in code.

00:11:27.876 --> 00:11:28.906 A:middle
When you're ready to send your

00:11:28.906 --> 00:11:29.956 A:middle
app's content out for

00:11:29.956 --> 00:11:31.736 A:middle
translation, this is as simple

00:11:31.736 --> 00:11:33.116 A:middle
as selecting your project file

00:11:33.146 --> 00:11:34.956 A:middle
in Xcode, and choosing Export

00:11:34.956 --> 00:11:36.586 A:middle
for Localization in the Editor

00:11:36.586 --> 00:11:36.926 A:middle
menu.

00:11:37.746 --> 00:11:38.786 A:middle
Xcode will generate a

00:11:38.786 --> 00:11:40.556 A:middle
translation interchange file, or

00:11:40.556 --> 00:11:42.256 A:middle
XLIFF, for you to send out for

00:11:42.256 --> 00:11:42.746 A:middle
translation.

00:11:45.606 --> 00:11:46.966 A:middle
Once you have this file back,

00:11:47.356 --> 00:11:48.866 A:middle
reimporting this content into

00:11:48.866 --> 00:11:50.386 A:middle
your Xcode project is just a

00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:51.716 A:middle
matter of selecting Import

00:11:51.716 --> 00:11:53.236 A:middle
Localizations from that same

00:11:53.236 --> 00:11:53.596 A:middle
menu.

00:11:55.386 --> 00:11:56.726 A:middle
Xcode will update all of the

00:11:56.726 --> 00:11:58.426 A:middle
relevant files and resources to

00:11:58.426 --> 00:11:59.506 A:middle
make sure that when your app is

00:11:59.506 --> 00:12:01.326 A:middle
built, all up to date supported

00:12:01.326 --> 00:12:02.626 A:middle
translations are included.

00:12:07.086 --> 00:12:08.516 A:middle
Once this is done, it's a good

00:12:08.516 --> 00:12:09.916 A:middle
idea to test your app in the

00:12:09.916 --> 00:12:10.916 A:middle
different environments that

00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:11.966 A:middle
you're planning on supporting.

00:12:13.016 --> 00:12:14.276 A:middle
Xcode provides a number of

00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:15.336 A:middle
different features to help you

00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:16.996 A:middle
do this, and you can get a good

00:12:16.996 --> 00:12:18.576 A:middle
idea of how your app behaves in

00:12:18.576 --> 00:12:20.026 A:middle
these circumstances, even if you

00:12:20.026 --> 00:12:21.146 A:middle
don't speak the languages you

00:12:21.146 --> 00:12:21.596 A:middle
support.

00:12:21.936 --> 00:12:26.806 A:middle
For Objective-C code, the Static

00:12:26.806 --> 00:12:28.226 A:middle
Analyzer supports making sure

00:12:28.226 --> 00:12:29.726 A:middle
that any string you provide to a

00:12:29.726 --> 00:12:31.256 A:middle
UI element is appropriately

00:12:31.256 --> 00:12:32.296 A:middle
marked as "localizable."

00:12:32.386 --> 00:12:34.406 A:middle
Not only that, you can also

00:12:34.406 --> 00:12:35.556 A:middle
check if any of your localized

00:12:35.556 --> 00:12:37.156 A:middle
strings are missing comments.

00:12:39.166 --> 00:12:40.056 A:middle
For running your app in

00:12:40.056 --> 00:12:41.316 A:middle
different languages, there's a

00:12:41.316 --> 00:12:42.686 A:middle
convenient set of options for

00:12:42.686 --> 00:12:44.386 A:middle
simulating a specific language

00:12:44.486 --> 00:12:45.286 A:middle
or region setting.

00:12:46.626 --> 00:12:48.706 A:middle
In addition to this, Xcode also

00:12:48.706 --> 00:12:49.846 A:middle
lets you run your app in a

00:12:49.846 --> 00:12:51.756 A:middle
simulated environment, or pseudo

00:12:51.756 --> 00:12:53.376 A:middle
language, such as right to left,

00:12:53.736 --> 00:12:55.146 A:middle
so that you can continue testing

00:12:55.146 --> 00:12:56.566 A:middle
your app in your base language,

00:12:56.926 --> 00:12:58.256 A:middle
but also see how it would look

00:12:58.256 --> 00:12:59.306 A:middle
like in a right to left

00:12:59.306 --> 00:12:59.736 A:middle
language.

00:13:00.336 --> 00:13:01.616 A:middle
This can be done in the Options

00:13:01.616 --> 00:13:03.206 A:middle
tab of the Scheme Editor for

00:13:03.206 --> 00:13:04.406 A:middle
your app.

00:13:06.176 --> 00:13:09.976 A:middle
The Localizing with Xcode 9

00:13:09.976 --> 00:13:11.296 A:middle
session, covers all of these

00:13:11.296 --> 00:13:12.706 A:middle
features and much more for

00:13:12.706 --> 00:13:13.916 A:middle
getting the most out of the tool

00:13:13.916 --> 00:13:15.536 A:middle
set when preparing your app for

00:13:15.536 --> 00:13:16.146 A:middle
localization.

00:13:17.876 --> 00:13:18.856 A:middle
And that's an overview of

00:13:18.856 --> 00:13:20.146 A:middle
localizing and testing your

00:13:20.146 --> 00:13:21.756 A:middle
application, from within Xcode.

00:13:22.376 --> 00:13:23.496 A:middle
We've seen how you can add

00:13:23.496 --> 00:13:24.646 A:middle
supported languages to your

00:13:24.646 --> 00:13:26.716 A:middle
project, integrate translations,

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.236 A:middle
as well as checking your project

00:13:28.236 --> 00:13:29.496 A:middle
and app out in different

00:13:29.496 --> 00:13:30.106 A:middle
environments.

00:13:32.026 --> 00:13:33.036 A:middle
For more information and

00:13:33.036 --> 00:13:34.366 A:middle
resources on localization,

00:13:34.626 --> 00:13:35.716 A:middle
please check out the link for

00:13:35.716 --> 00:13:36.176 A:middle
the session.

00:13:39.646 --> 00:13:41.056 A:middle
In addition to these resources,

00:13:41.246 --> 00:13:42.526 A:middle
if you're interested in a deeper

00:13:42.526 --> 00:13:44.256 A:middle
exploration of localization and

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:45.946 A:middle
internationalization topics, the

00:13:45.946 --> 00:13:47.276 A:middle
sessions listed are a great

00:13:47.276 --> 00:13:47.896 A:middle
place to start.

00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:50.516 A:middle
Thank you for watching.
