[ Background Conversations ]

00:00:21.496 --> 00:00:23.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm sure many of us here have

00:00:23.216 --> 00:00:24.086 A:middle
found ourselves in this

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:24.736 A:middle
situation.

00:00:26.216 --> 00:00:27.996 A:middle
You're in the bathtub, and you

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:29.396 A:middle
come up with an amazing idea for

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:29.816 A:middle
your app.

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.146 A:middle
Or perhaps a little bit less

00:00:32.146 --> 00:00:34.356 A:middle
relaxing, you get a text message

00:00:34.356 --> 00:00:35.676 A:middle
from someone very important in

00:00:35.676 --> 00:00:37.256 A:middle
your organization asking you to

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:39.346 A:middle
come up with amazing ideas for a

00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:39.706 A:middle
new app.

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.096 A:middle
Looks like we are going to be

00:00:41.096 --> 00:00:42.046 A:middle
looking at Timers today.

00:00:43.086 --> 00:00:44.676 A:middle
So in those situations, you

00:00:44.676 --> 00:00:46.126 A:middle
might tell yourself, "I don't

00:00:46.126 --> 00:00:46.586 A:middle
have time."

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:48.296 A:middle
You might want to dive into X

00:00:48.296 --> 00:00:49.786 A:middle
code, start typing out some

00:00:49.786 --> 00:00:51.576 A:middle
Swift, but the problem with that

00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:52.756 A:middle
is that once you get committed

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:54.576 A:middle
to code, you're really deep into

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:55.806 A:middle
how your app is going to work,

00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:57.326 A:middle
and you don't get much leeway to

00:00:57.326 --> 00:00:58.856 A:middle
explore all the alternatives

00:00:58.856 --> 00:00:59.366 A:middle
that you could.

00:01:00.286 --> 00:01:01.376 A:middle
Or you might want to dive into

00:01:01.376 --> 00:01:02.926 A:middle
Sketch, and draw some really

00:01:02.926 --> 00:01:03.856 A:middle
detailed visuals.

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:05.986 A:middle
But again, the problem with that

00:01:06.356 --> 00:01:07.606 A:middle
is that visuals are not

00:01:07.606 --> 00:01:08.236 A:middle
interactive.

00:01:08.496 --> 00:01:09.486 A:middle
We're building apps.

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:11.616 A:middle
We want to try it as if it were

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:12.056 A:middle
a real app.

00:01:12.946 --> 00:01:14.776 A:middle
So let me show you something I

00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:16.896 A:middle
may build after getting my CEO

00:01:16.896 --> 00:01:17.666 A:middle
asking for a Timer.

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:20.556 A:middle
This is a very basic concept.

00:01:20.776 --> 00:01:22.366 A:middle
I tap to add five seconds to the

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:22.796 A:middle
timer.

00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:23.626 A:middle
Let's make it 10.

00:01:23.626 --> 00:01:25.546 A:middle
I press Start, and it starts

00:01:25.546 --> 00:01:26.546 A:middle
counting down to zero.

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:29.226 A:middle
Nothing fancy here, just an idea

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:30.716 A:middle
I had about how the Timer app

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:31.126 A:middle
might look.

00:01:32.346 --> 00:01:33.456 A:middle
Now, as you might have guessed,

00:01:33.456 --> 00:01:34.686 A:middle
from the title of this talk,

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:36.696 A:middle
this is not a real app.

00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:39.736 A:middle
It's a prototype, and it only

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:41.676 A:middle
took me 60 seconds to build.

00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.416 A:middle
That is less time than it took

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:45.396 A:middle
you to brush your teeth this

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:46.656 A:middle
morning...hopefully [laughter].

00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:51.496 A:middle
So why do we build prototypes?

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.656 A:middle
We build prototypes to test

00:01:53.656 --> 00:01:54.236 A:middle
ideas.

00:01:54.396 --> 00:01:55.686 A:middle
Some things that seem really

00:01:55.686 --> 00:01:57.446 A:middle
great might turn out to be not

00:01:57.446 --> 00:01:58.816 A:middle
so great once you try it.

00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:00.796 A:middle
And some things that don't

00:02:00.796 --> 00:02:02.116 A:middle
appear very good at first might

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:03.486 A:middle
actually have some very valuable

00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:04.246 A:middle
insights to them.

00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:06.466 A:middle
This is about saving time and

00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:07.926 A:middle
money by making sure that when

00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:09.676 A:middle
you commit to building something

00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:10.826 A:middle
by writing code, designing

00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:12.306 A:middle
assets, you're building the

00:02:12.306 --> 00:02:13.000 A:middle
right thing.

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:15.826 A:middle
We also make prototypes to get

00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:16.596 A:middle
new ideas.

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:18.856 A:middle
The act of making prototypes and

00:02:18.856 --> 00:02:20.506 A:middle
showing them to people will

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:21.666 A:middle
bring new insights that will

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:22.646 A:middle
help make your product even

00:02:22.646 --> 00:02:22.946 A:middle
better.

00:02:24.156 --> 00:02:26.166 A:middle
Designers love diagrams, so here

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:27.056 A:middle
is a diagram of what the

00:02:27.056 --> 00:02:28.186 A:middle
prototyping process might look

00:02:28.186 --> 00:02:28.436 A:middle
like.

00:02:29.146 --> 00:02:31.356 A:middle
We make prototypes, we show them

00:02:31.356 --> 00:02:33.146 A:middle
to people, and we learn from the

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:33.716 A:middle
feedback.

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:36.456 A:middle
And we do this over and over and

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:37.846 A:middle
over again, until we know we're

00:02:37.876 --> 00:02:39.036 A:middle
really making the right thing.

00:02:40.186 --> 00:02:41.556 A:middle
So let's start by making a

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:42.036 A:middle
prototype.

00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:43.556 A:middle
Who can make prototypes?

00:02:43.926 --> 00:02:46.526 A:middle
Everyone. It is about using

00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:48.086 A:middle
tools that you already use every

00:02:48.086 --> 00:02:48.346 A:middle
day.

00:02:48.806 --> 00:02:50.726 A:middle
If you are a developer, you

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:53.016 A:middle
might use X code in Swift, or

00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:54.746 A:middle
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:02:55.606 --> 00:02:57.976 A:middle
If you are a designer, you might

00:02:57.976 --> 00:02:59.626 A:middle
use Sketch or Illustrator.

00:03:00.356 --> 00:03:01.986 A:middle
But even if you don't code or

00:03:01.986 --> 00:03:03.086 A:middle
design, you can build

00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:03.836 A:middle
prototypes.

00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:06.216 A:middle
You can use keynotes, or your

00:03:06.216 --> 00:03:07.286 A:middle
favorite text processor.

00:03:08.296 --> 00:03:09.756 A:middle
It's about subverting your

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:10.146 A:middle
tools.

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:12.136 A:middle
Use tools that you use already

00:03:12.136 --> 00:03:13.756 A:middle
every day, and push them in new

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:14.196 A:middle
ways.

00:03:14.496 --> 00:03:16.956 A:middle
If it can display images, and

00:03:16.956 --> 00:03:18.416 A:middle
respond to user interaction, you

00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:19.956 A:middle
can probably build prototypes

00:03:19.956 --> 00:03:20.396 A:middle
with it.

00:03:20.796 --> 00:03:22.876 A:middle
So let me show you how I built

00:03:22.876 --> 00:03:23.696 A:middle
the prototype we just saw

00:03:23.696 --> 00:03:25.656 A:middle
earlier, just using Keynotes, in

00:03:25.656 --> 00:03:26.656 A:middle
under 60 seconds.

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:28.206 A:middle
Now, the video you're about to

00:03:28.206 --> 00:03:29.496 A:middle
see is a little fast, because I

00:03:29.496 --> 00:03:30.466 A:middle
like to use Keynote a lot for

00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:31.896 A:middle
that kind of stuff, but let me

00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:32.496 A:middle
get you through it.

00:03:32.496 --> 00:03:35.116 A:middle
So I start by making my document

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:36.026 A:middle
the size of an iPhone.

00:03:36.546 --> 00:03:37.776 A:middle
And I'm going to draw the clock

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:38.616 A:middle
face for my timer.

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:40.846 A:middle
You'll notice I'm not using

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:42.706 A:middle
really fancy design assets, I'm

00:03:42.706 --> 00:03:44.216 A:middle
just using basic Keynote shapes.

00:03:44.756 --> 00:03:45.576 A:middle
Let's do the same thing for the

00:03:45.576 --> 00:03:46.716 A:middle
button, the Start button.

00:03:47.186 --> 00:03:48.376 A:middle
Again, just using a basic

00:03:48.376 --> 00:03:48.916 A:middle
Keynote shape.

00:03:49.436 --> 00:03:50.356 A:middle
Let's make it green.

00:03:50.926 --> 00:03:52.106 A:middle
And let's make it say Start.

00:03:52.986 --> 00:03:54.046 A:middle
Now, I'm adding the hand for my

00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:54.466 A:middle
timer.

00:03:55.766 --> 00:03:57.526 A:middle
The trick I'm going to use is in

00:03:57.526 --> 00:03:58.356 A:middle
Keynote, when you rotate

00:03:58.356 --> 00:03:59.576 A:middle
objects, they rotate around

00:03:59.576 --> 00:04:00.136 A:middle
their center.

00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:01.116 A:middle
So here, you see I am

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:02.976 A:middle
copy/pasting the hand, moving it

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.306 A:middle
to the lower part, and making it

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:04.846 A:middle
invisible.

00:04:05.386 --> 00:04:07.496 A:middle
Now, I can group them and I can

00:04:07.496 --> 00:04:08.856 A:middle
rotate it and it will look just

00:04:08.856 --> 00:04:09.926 A:middle
like a hand on the timer would.

00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:12.426 A:middle
So we make it rotate to the 5

00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:14.126 A:middle
second mark for the first tap,

00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:15.556 A:middle
no easing to make it look just

00:04:15.556 --> 00:04:17.196 A:middle
like a real clock, and we add

00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:18.526 A:middle
another animation for the 10

00:04:18.526 --> 00:04:19.066 A:middle
second mark.

00:04:19.766 --> 00:04:22.196 A:middle
And finally, the last animation,

00:04:22.286 --> 00:04:23.676 A:middle
which is the hand of the timer

00:04:23.676 --> 00:04:25.046 A:middle
rotating all the way back to the

00:04:25.046 --> 00:04:25.836 A:middle
0 second mark.

00:04:27.786 --> 00:04:29.396 A:middle
And as this animation starts, we

00:04:29.396 --> 00:04:30.566 A:middle
make the Start button disappear.

00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:32.496 A:middle
And that's it.

00:04:32.496 --> 00:04:33.456 A:middle
Just like that, we have a

00:04:33.456 --> 00:04:35.146 A:middle
prototype that we can load on an

00:04:35.186 --> 00:04:36.876 A:middle
iPhone, and have it look just

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:37.876 A:middle
like a real app.

00:04:38.516 --> 00:04:43.966 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:44.466 --> 00:04:45.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So now that we've made a

00:04:45.206 --> 00:04:47.116 A:middle
prototype, we show it to people.

00:04:48.386 --> 00:04:49.716 A:middle
As we show it to people, we ask

00:04:49.716 --> 00:04:51.456 A:middle
ourselves, how can we make it

00:04:51.456 --> 00:04:51.896 A:middle
better?

00:04:51.986 --> 00:04:54.666 A:middle
I have some theories about what

00:04:54.666 --> 00:04:56.476 A:middle
will work and what won't, and

00:04:56.476 --> 00:04:57.906 A:middle
look for evidence that supports

00:04:57.906 --> 00:04:59.076 A:middle
or contradicts those theories.

00:04:59.546 --> 00:05:02.236 A:middle
Don't argue, defend, or dismiss

00:05:02.236 --> 00:05:03.046 A:middle
the feedback you get.

00:05:03.726 --> 00:05:04.946 A:middle
It is also very important to

00:05:04.946 --> 00:05:06.416 A:middle
show your prototypes in context,

00:05:06.746 --> 00:05:08.266 A:middle
on the device they're meant for,

00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:09.386 A:middle
in a somewhat realistic

00:05:09.386 --> 00:05:10.086 A:middle
situation.

00:05:10.736 --> 00:05:11.736 A:middle
You can't test things in a

00:05:11.736 --> 00:05:12.196 A:middle
vacuum.

00:05:12.906 --> 00:05:14.556 A:middle
So, for example, here I ask my

00:05:14.556 --> 00:05:16.256 A:middle
co-worker to test the pH of a

00:05:16.446 --> 00:05:17.586 A:middle
little bit of water, using the

00:05:17.586 --> 00:05:17.996 A:middle
timer.

00:05:17.996 --> 00:05:20.806 A:middle
So we add the pH reagent, press

00:05:20.806 --> 00:05:22.116 A:middle
the Start button, and start

00:05:22.116 --> 00:05:23.116 A:middle
shaking the test tube for 10

00:05:23.116 --> 00:05:23.566 A:middle
seconds.

00:05:24.456 --> 00:05:25.716 A:middle
So in this case, it seems to

00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:26.966 A:middle
work pretty well, right?

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:28.056 A:middle
Like, it is not a very

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:29.176 A:middle
complicated use case.

00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:30.466 A:middle
Maybe it would be nice to have

00:05:30.466 --> 00:05:32.716 A:middle
the Timer flash, or play a sound

00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:34.286 A:middle
at the end, but it seems to work

00:05:34.286 --> 00:05:34.696 A:middle
pretty well.

00:05:36.156 --> 00:05:37.386 A:middle
Now, my friend David used to be

00:05:37.386 --> 00:05:38.306 A:middle
really good at solving the

00:05:38.306 --> 00:05:39.846 A:middle
Rubik's Cube in high school, so

00:05:39.846 --> 00:05:40.866 A:middle
I asked him to see if he could

00:05:40.866 --> 00:05:41.876 A:middle
still solve a Rubik's Cube in

00:05:41.876 --> 00:05:42.736 A:middle
under 10 seconds.

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:50.896 A:middle
All right.

00:05:51.366 --> 00:05:52.276 A:middle
Looks like he's still got it,

00:05:52.476 --> 00:05:53.556 A:middle
with time to spare, too

00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:55.851 A:middle
[applause].

00:05:56.146 --> 00:05:57.556 A:middle
Now, as David was using this,

00:05:57.556 --> 00:05:58.456 A:middle
there are a number of things

00:05:58.456 --> 00:05:59.366 A:middle
that he was telling me.

00:05:59.496 --> 00:06:00.726 A:middle
He found that the Start button

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:02.246 A:middle
was a little small, and hard to

00:06:02.246 --> 00:06:02.626 A:middle
tap.

00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:04.726 A:middle
He also thought it would be nice

00:06:04.726 --> 00:06:05.656 A:middle
if there was a countdown when

00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:06.946 A:middle
you press Start, so he could

00:06:07.186 --> 00:06:08.246 A:middle
really position himself on the

00:06:08.246 --> 00:06:10.386 A:middle
Rubik's Cube, and he really

00:06:10.386 --> 00:06:12.896 A:middle
wanted to see the actual precise

00:06:12.926 --> 00:06:14.126 A:middle
time, so he could tell if he

00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:15.746 A:middle
beat his record or not.

00:06:15.996 --> 00:06:17.176 A:middle
You see that this opens up a lot

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:18.726 A:middle
of interesting design questions

00:06:18.726 --> 00:06:20.256 A:middle
around what we're building, and

00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:21.036 A:middle
what it should be like.

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:25.546 A:middle
Once we've shown our prototypes,

00:06:26.126 --> 00:06:27.566 A:middle
we take a moment to step back

00:06:28.236 --> 00:06:29.326 A:middle
and learn from the feedback that

00:06:29.326 --> 00:06:30.386 A:middle
we have gathered.

00:06:31.076 --> 00:06:31.916 A:middle
What is working?

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:33.846 A:middle
What is not working?

00:06:34.476 --> 00:06:36.016 A:middle
Do we refine what we have?

00:06:36.516 --> 00:06:37.966 A:middle
Or do we try something else

00:06:37.966 --> 00:06:38.646 A:middle
altogether?

00:06:39.056 --> 00:06:40.306 A:middle
Perhaps do some brainstorming to

00:06:40.306 --> 00:06:41.346 A:middle
come up with the next steps?

00:06:42.546 --> 00:06:44.266 A:middle
For example, here are some of

00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:46.106 A:middle
the questions that we got as we

00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:47.146 A:middle
showed our prototype.

00:06:47.936 --> 00:06:49.226 A:middle
Do we display the time left on

00:06:49.226 --> 00:06:51.236 A:middle
the timer, or the time elapsed?

00:06:51.896 --> 00:06:53.826 A:middle
How do you pause or stop the

00:06:53.826 --> 00:06:54.276 A:middle
timer?

00:06:55.286 --> 00:06:56.336 A:middle
Should we show the time in

00:06:56.336 --> 00:06:58.316 A:middle
digital form or analog form, or

00:06:58.386 --> 00:06:59.036 A:middle
maybe both?

00:07:00.226 --> 00:07:02.286 A:middle
And are we building a generic

00:07:02.286 --> 00:07:03.836 A:middle
timer, or one for a very

00:07:03.836 --> 00:07:05.616 A:middle
specific purpose, like solving

00:07:05.616 --> 00:07:06.356 A:middle
Rubik's Cubes?

00:07:07.436 --> 00:07:10.026 A:middle
And many, many other questions.

00:07:10.376 --> 00:07:12.026 A:middle
Now, the goal isn't to answer

00:07:12.026 --> 00:07:13.266 A:middle
all of those questions, but

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:14.766 A:middle
rather to know what you don't

00:07:14.766 --> 00:07:15.946 A:middle
know, so you can then

00:07:15.946 --> 00:07:18.456 A:middle
strategically choose what to

00:07:18.456 --> 00:07:19.216 A:middle
pursue next.

00:07:21.336 --> 00:07:22.326 A:middle
Here is how I might improve this

00:07:22.326 --> 00:07:23.486 A:middle
prototype after showing it.

00:07:23.946 --> 00:07:25.926 A:middle
So, David told me that the Start

00:07:25.926 --> 00:07:27.126 A:middle
button was small, and the Clock

00:07:27.126 --> 00:07:28.636 A:middle
was hard to see, so I agree with

00:07:28.676 --> 00:07:28.876 A:middle
him.

00:07:28.876 --> 00:07:29.796 A:middle
I'm going to make it a nice,

00:07:29.796 --> 00:07:31.796 A:middle
bold red, and let's make the

00:07:31.796 --> 00:07:33.086 A:middle
hand white, just so that it

00:07:33.086 --> 00:07:33.866 A:middle
really stands out.

00:07:34.256 --> 00:07:35.476 A:middle
Start button is too small, so

00:07:35.476 --> 00:07:36.166 A:middle
let's do away with it

00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:37.986 A:middle
altogether, and maybe we make

00:07:37.986 --> 00:07:39.036 A:middle
the entire lower portion of

00:07:39.036 --> 00:07:40.246 A:middle
this, creating a tap region.

00:07:40.496 --> 00:07:41.796 A:middle
And let's make it say Start in

00:07:41.796 --> 00:07:43.286 A:middle
nice, bold letters.

00:07:43.656 --> 00:07:44.746 A:middle
Same color as the clock to keep

00:07:44.746 --> 00:07:45.356 A:middle
it consistent.

00:07:46.306 --> 00:07:48.226 A:middle
And I'm going to add a finish

00:07:48.226 --> 00:07:49.816 A:middle
screen for my timer, so we know

00:07:50.006 --> 00:07:51.506 A:middle
the timer is done counting down.

00:07:51.746 --> 00:07:53.136 A:middle
So I just add a new slide that

00:07:53.136 --> 00:07:54.886 A:middle
we navigate to automatically and

00:07:54.886 --> 00:07:55.956 A:middle
have it say Timer Done.

00:07:56.966 --> 00:07:58.046 A:middle
And just like that, we have a

00:07:58.046 --> 00:07:59.436 A:middle
new iteration of our prototype,

00:07:59.566 --> 00:08:01.086 A:middle
that we can build on, and show

00:08:01.086 --> 00:08:01.466 A:middle
to people.

00:08:04.056 --> 00:08:06.066 A:middle
Making things fast lets you

00:08:06.106 --> 00:08:07.956 A:middle
quickly explore a very wide

00:08:07.956 --> 00:08:09.696 A:middle
range of ideas and directions.

00:08:10.076 --> 00:08:11.416 A:middle
Here are some more prototypes

00:08:11.416 --> 00:08:12.716 A:middle
that I built in Keynote around

00:08:12.716 --> 00:08:13.576 A:middle
the concept of the Timer.

00:08:14.316 --> 00:08:16.036 A:middle
Now, some of them, as you see,

00:08:16.036 --> 00:08:17.626 A:middle
are aesthetic explorations

00:08:17.626 --> 00:08:18.676 A:middle
around what a Timer might look

00:08:18.676 --> 00:08:19.926 A:middle
like, or how you might interact

00:08:19.926 --> 00:08:22.756 A:middle
with it, while others are more

00:08:22.756 --> 00:08:24.216 A:middle
specific use cases.

00:08:24.216 --> 00:08:26.256 A:middle
Timers for developing film or

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:27.046 A:middle
cooking a steak.

00:08:27.396 --> 00:08:29.676 A:middle
That is also where having a very

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:32.396 A:middle
diverse team helps your process

00:08:32.396 --> 00:08:32.766 A:middle
a lot.

00:08:32.826 --> 00:08:34.836 A:middle
It will let you stumble upon

00:08:34.836 --> 00:08:35.986 A:middle
things you never would have on

00:08:35.986 --> 00:08:36.386 A:middle
your own.

00:08:36.906 --> 00:08:39.636 A:middle
For example, my co-worker made

00:08:39.676 --> 00:08:41.086 A:middle
this Timer to help their child

00:08:41.086 --> 00:08:41.766 A:middle
brush their teeth.

00:08:42.616 --> 00:08:47.126 A:middle
So we make quick interactive

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:47.896 A:middle
prototypes.

00:08:48.886 --> 00:08:49.896 A:middle
We show them to people.

00:08:50.056 --> 00:08:51.826 A:middle
And we learn from the feedback.

00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:54.956 A:middle
And we do this over, and over,

00:08:55.096 --> 00:08:56.796 A:middle
and over again, until we know

00:08:56.796 --> 00:08:57.836 A:middle
we're doing the right thing.

00:08:58.936 --> 00:09:00.386 A:middle
If you start by making one

00:09:00.386 --> 00:09:02.346 A:middle
thing, you'll be inspired to

00:09:02.346 --> 00:09:03.136 A:middle
make a few others.

00:09:03.136 --> 00:09:07.896 A:middle
Some of these things will work

00:09:07.896 --> 00:09:10.716 A:middle
really well, and the ideas will

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.116 A:middle
make it mostly unchanged

00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:12.966 A:middle
throughout your prototyping

00:09:12.966 --> 00:09:14.296 A:middle
process, and on to your final

00:09:14.296 --> 00:09:14.726 A:middle
product.

00:09:15.546 --> 00:09:16.626 A:middle
Most things will have some

00:09:16.626 --> 00:09:18.116 A:middle
aspects that work, and others

00:09:18.116 --> 00:09:19.006 A:middle
that don't work as well.

00:09:19.076 --> 00:09:20.406 A:middle
You will be able to take those

00:09:20.406 --> 00:09:21.866 A:middle
and modify them and recombine

00:09:21.866 --> 00:09:23.406 A:middle
them in new prototypes that you

00:09:23.406 --> 00:09:24.756 A:middle
can show and explore.

00:09:26.116 --> 00:09:28.086 A:middle
And finally, a few things won't

00:09:28.086 --> 00:09:29.416 A:middle
work at all, and it is great

00:09:29.416 --> 00:09:30.166 A:middle
when that happens.

00:09:30.396 --> 00:09:31.116 A:middle
You've just learned something

00:09:31.116 --> 00:09:33.096 A:middle
very valuable about your app,

00:09:33.236 --> 00:09:34.386 A:middle
and you're not going to be

00:09:34.386 --> 00:09:36.366 A:middle
spending designing time or

00:09:36.366 --> 00:09:37.756 A:middle
programming time building things

00:09:37.756 --> 00:09:38.686 A:middle
that would not have worked out.

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:42.226 A:middle
The goal is to take ideas from

00:09:42.226 --> 00:09:44.216 A:middle
your head into the real world,

00:09:44.616 --> 00:09:47.646 A:middle
on device, in context, in front

00:09:47.646 --> 00:09:50.216 A:middle
of people, as fast as possible.

00:09:50.716 --> 00:09:54.426 A:middle
As you are leaving WWDC later

00:09:54.426 --> 00:09:56.716 A:middle
today, here are a few things you

00:09:56.716 --> 00:09:57.136 A:middle
can do.

00:09:58.516 --> 00:09:59.626 A:middle
If you don't make prototypes

00:09:59.626 --> 00:10:00.946 A:middle
already, the next time you have

00:10:00.946 --> 00:10:02.516 A:middle
an idea for an app, or future

00:10:02.516 --> 00:10:04.386 A:middle
for your app, make prototypes.

00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:05.536 A:middle
Show them to your colleagues.

00:10:06.986 --> 00:10:08.396 A:middle
If you already make prototypes,

00:10:08.726 --> 00:10:09.386 A:middle
amazing!

00:10:09.386 --> 00:10:09.866 A:middle
Wonderful!

00:10:10.306 --> 00:10:11.976 A:middle
Find co-workers who don't, and

00:10:11.976 --> 00:10:12.946 A:middle
show them how you do it.

00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:15.806 A:middle
And if you manage a team, make

00:10:15.806 --> 00:10:16.656 A:middle
sure that you're building the

00:10:16.656 --> 00:10:19.436 A:middle
right thing, by making time for

00:10:19.436 --> 00:10:20.726 A:middle
prototyping as part of your

00:10:20.726 --> 00:10:21.576 A:middle
process and culture.

00:10:23.116 --> 00:10:24.566 A:middle
Imagine how wonderful it would

00:10:24.566 --> 00:10:26.026 A:middle
be if the next time you get a

00:10:26.026 --> 00:10:27.426 A:middle
text message like this from your

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:29.386 A:middle
CEO, you can reply just 60

00:10:29.386 --> 00:10:30.806 A:middle
seconds later with a prototype

00:10:31.016 --> 00:10:31.526 A:middle
like this.

00:10:32.106 --> 00:10:32.446 A:middle
Thank you.

00:10:33.016 --> 00:10:34.330 A:middle
[ Applause ]
