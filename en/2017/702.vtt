00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:27.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

00:00:27.946 --> 00:00:30.316 A:middle
My name is Georgios Kontaxis,

00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:32.206 A:middle
and together with Katie Skinner,

00:00:32.586 --> 00:00:34.606 A:middle
we are both very excited to be

00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:36.196 A:middle
here, today, to tell you about

00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:37.636 A:middle
Privacy and your Apps.

00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:39.726 A:middle
We are members of Privacy

00:00:39.726 --> 00:00:41.686 A:middle
Engineering, Apple, and we work

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:43.566 A:middle
with teams across the company to

00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.936 A:middle
deliver privacy into our

00:00:44.936 --> 00:00:45.556 A:middle
products.

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.046 A:middle
Here, at Apple, we care about

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:47.466 A:middle
privacy.

00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:49.936 A:middle
And this quote from Tim Cook

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:51.216 A:middle
reflects our philosophy.

00:00:52.536 --> 00:00:55.446 A:middle
We believe that privacy is a

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:59.406 A:middle
very basic foundation for a

00:00:59.406 --> 00:01:00.566 A:middle
great app ecosystem.

00:00:59.406 --> 00:01:00.566 A:middle
great app ecosystem.

00:01:01.816 --> 00:01:03.436 A:middle
We think that great apps should

00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:05.266 A:middle
offer the best user experience,

00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:07.486 A:middle
while respecting user privacy.

00:01:08.286 --> 00:01:10.276 A:middle
So, today, you will hear some

00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:12.586 A:middle
best practices to design your

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:14.156 A:middle
apps with privacy in mind.

00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:16.896 A:middle
If you have existing apps, you

00:01:16.896 --> 00:01:18.446 A:middle
will be very interested in

00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:20.376 A:middle
updates to our platforms which

00:01:20.376 --> 00:01:21.106 A:middle
might affect you.

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:23.006 A:middle
And you will learn about some

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.136 A:middle
exciting new privacy features

00:01:25.246 --> 00:01:27.366 A:middle
that Apple is launching, this

00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:28.436 A:middle
year.

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:31.286 A:middle
We know that your apps may rely

00:01:31.286 --> 00:01:33.016 A:middle
on user data to deliver great

00:01:33.046 --> 00:01:33.526 A:middle
features.

00:01:34.256 --> 00:01:36.216 A:middle
So, it is important that you

00:01:36.216 --> 00:01:38.676 A:middle
explain to your users how you're

00:01:38.676 --> 00:01:40.446 A:middle
using their data, so they

00:01:40.446 --> 00:01:42.626 A:middle
understand what is going on and

00:01:42.626 --> 00:01:44.496 A:middle
they feel comfortable engaging

00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:45.266 A:middle
with your app.

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:47.836 A:middle
Also, you need to get their

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:49.856 A:middle
consent in the right context.

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:52.296 A:middle
For example, as they're about to

00:01:52.296 --> 00:01:54.156 A:middle
use a feature that relies on

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.096 A:middle
their data.

00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:59.216 A:middle
iOS has built-in mediation

00:01:59.216 --> 00:02:01.806 A:middle
mechanisms for transparency and

00:01:59.216 --> 00:02:01.806 A:middle
mechanisms for transparency and

00:02:01.806 --> 00:02:04.846 A:middle
consent, and you should consider

00:02:04.846 --> 00:02:08.076 A:middle
how you can best take advantage

00:02:08.106 --> 00:02:09.626 A:middle
of them.

00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:12.216 A:middle
iOS also offers users control

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:12.856 A:middle
over their privacy.

00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:16.176 A:middle
So, your apps need to handle

00:02:16.226 --> 00:02:18.146 A:middle
cases based on the different

00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:20.396 A:middle
privacy decisions the user might

00:02:20.426 --> 00:02:22.906 A:middle
make, including changing their

00:02:22.906 --> 00:02:26.536 A:middle
mind at a later time.

00:02:26.716 --> 00:02:28.806 A:middle
Here's an example of how Maps is

00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:30.796 A:middle
using the iOS built-in

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:33.226 A:middle
mechanisms to prompt for the

00:02:33.226 --> 00:02:34.036 A:middle
user's location.

00:02:34.806 --> 00:02:36.256 A:middle
As you can see, when prompting

00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:38.516 A:middle
Maps will clearly explain the

00:02:38.516 --> 00:02:41.516 A:middle
use cases, navigation, nearby

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:43.736 A:middle
search results, and estimated

00:02:43.736 --> 00:02:44.426 A:middle
travel times.

00:02:45.396 --> 00:02:48.306 A:middle
And if the user chooses not to

00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:49.856 A:middle
grant access to their location,

00:02:50.146 --> 00:02:51.796 A:middle
Maps is able to handle that

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:53.986 A:middle
gracefully and provide a subset

00:02:54.036 --> 00:02:54.876 A:middle
of its features.

00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:58.636 A:middle
If a user allows Maps the user

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:01.146 A:middle
location, they will be aware

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:01.146 A:middle
location, they will be aware

00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:03.506 A:middle
each time that happens, because

00:03:03.506 --> 00:03:05.506 A:middle
there is an indicator in the iOS

00:03:05.626 --> 00:03:07.266 A:middle
status bar to let them know.

00:03:08.076 --> 00:03:09.186 A:middle
And they can always go to

00:03:09.246 --> 00:03:11.296 A:middle
Settings, Privacy, Location

00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:13.976 A:middle
Services, see that Maps is using

00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:16.016 A:middle
their location and perhaps,

00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:17.446 A:middle
revise their decision.

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:21.966 A:middle
We also, know that your apps may

00:03:21.966 --> 00:03:23.766 A:middle
rely on identifiers, for

00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:25.386 A:middle
example, to personalize the user

00:03:25.386 --> 00:03:27.646 A:middle
experience or to keep track of

00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:28.096 A:middle
feedback.

00:03:29.606 --> 00:03:31.626 A:middle
At the same time, your users

00:03:31.626 --> 00:03:32.786 A:middle
might wonder whether their

00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:35.426 A:middle
actions in your app are tied to

00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:36.976 A:middle
their device or to their person.

00:03:38.096 --> 00:03:40.576 A:middle
Luckily, there are great ways to

00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:42.946 A:middle
offer privacy friendly choices,

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.676 A:middle
so that users are comfortable

00:03:44.676 --> 00:03:46.136 A:middle
engaging with your apps.

00:03:47.006 --> 00:03:49.736 A:middle
Specifically, identifiers can be

00:03:49.736 --> 00:03:51.686 A:middle
random, they can be anonymous,

00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:53.276 A:middle
they can be short-lived, and

00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:55.386 A:middle
they can be easy to reset.

00:03:56.206 --> 00:04:00.396 A:middle
And iOS offers built-in API for

00:03:56.206 --> 00:04:00.396 A:middle
And iOS offers built-in API for

00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:02.326 A:middle
you to be able to generate such

00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:03.216 A:middle
identifiers.

00:04:03.646 --> 00:04:05.126 A:middle
So, you should adopt those

00:04:05.356 --> 00:04:07.126 A:middle
instead of building your own.

00:04:07.686 --> 00:04:10.216 A:middle
As an example, consider the

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:12.356 A:middle
Universally Unique Identifier.

00:04:13.026 --> 00:04:16.206 A:middle
It is a random 128-bit value,

00:04:16.616 --> 00:04:18.346 A:middle
which you can generate using the

00:04:18.346 --> 00:04:19.685 A:middle
Swift code, shown here.

00:04:20.546 --> 00:04:22.576 A:middle
And as you can see, three

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:24.906 A:middle
consecutive calls using this API

00:04:25.546 --> 00:04:27.686 A:middle
will return three random

00:04:28.186 --> 00:04:29.136 A:middle
unrelated values.

00:04:29.926 --> 00:04:31.376 A:middle
And for example, you could

00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:33.556 A:middle
leverage the UIDs to generate

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:35.406 A:middle
short-lived identifiers.

00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:38.396 A:middle
For example, you can associate a

00:04:38.396 --> 00:04:41.176 A:middle
new UUID with each session in

00:04:41.176 --> 00:04:43.056 A:middle
your app.

00:04:43.056 --> 00:04:45.606 A:middle
Another example is the vendor

00:04:45.606 --> 00:04:46.206 A:middle
identifier.

00:04:46.206 --> 00:04:48.736 A:middle
It is a more stable identifier,

00:04:49.196 --> 00:04:51.456 A:middle
because it is consistent across

00:04:51.456 --> 00:04:53.556 A:middle
all apps associated with the

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:54.366 A:middle
same team.

00:04:54.936 --> 00:04:57.416 A:middle
As you can see, here, in the

00:04:57.416 --> 00:05:00.516 A:middle
example table, two apps that

00:04:57.416 --> 00:05:00.516 A:middle
example table, two apps that

00:05:00.516 --> 00:05:02.216 A:middle
belong to the same team all

00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:04.316 A:middle
generate the same vendor

00:05:04.316 --> 00:05:07.016 A:middle
identifier, while a third app

00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:08.956 A:middle
belonging to a different team

00:05:09.256 --> 00:05:10.056 A:middle
will have its own.

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:14.336 A:middle
Also, keep in mind that if all

00:05:14.476 --> 00:05:16.236 A:middle
apps belonging to a particular

00:05:16.236 --> 00:05:18.186 A:middle
team are uninstalled from the

00:05:18.186 --> 00:05:19.896 A:middle
user's device and later

00:05:19.896 --> 00:05:22.466 A:middle
reinstalled, they will get a new

00:05:22.466 --> 00:05:22.996 A:middle
identifier.

00:05:22.996 --> 00:05:26.636 A:middle
Now, let's talk about collecting

00:05:26.986 --> 00:05:28.926 A:middle
data to enable your features.

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:31.666 A:middle
Collecting data can be a

00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:33.496 A:middle
benefit, but also, carries

00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:34.056 A:middle
risks.

00:05:35.176 --> 00:05:38.976 A:middle
So, users might be uncomfortable

00:05:39.856 --> 00:05:41.306 A:middle
giving too much of their data,

00:05:41.856 --> 00:05:42.946 A:middle
if you do not sufficiently

00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:44.296 A:middle
justify the purpose.

00:05:44.996 --> 00:05:47.146 A:middle
And also, consider the burden on

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:49.846 A:middle
your end to manage all that data

00:05:50.036 --> 00:05:51.656 A:middle
and keep it safe.

00:05:51.906 --> 00:05:53.266 A:middle
So, you should consider

00:05:53.736 --> 00:05:55.866 A:middle
aggregating data, summarizing

00:05:55.866 --> 00:05:57.426 A:middle
it, and extracting only the

00:05:57.426 --> 00:05:59.126 A:middle
information you need.

00:05:59.686 --> 00:06:02.216 A:middle
As an alternative, think whether

00:05:59.686 --> 00:06:02.216 A:middle
As an alternative, think whether

00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:03.916 A:middle
a sample of the data would

00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:06.926 A:middle
suffice, or whether you can

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:09.576 A:middle
process the data on device

00:06:10.526 --> 00:06:11.966 A:middle
instead of sending their all

00:06:11.966 --> 00:06:13.546 A:middle
values to your server.

00:06:14.406 --> 00:06:16.056 A:middle
And later in this talk, you will

00:06:16.056 --> 00:06:17.656 A:middle
hear about some great new ways

00:06:18.026 --> 00:06:20.426 A:middle
to process data on device, using

00:06:20.476 --> 00:06:23.966 A:middle
iOS hardware and software.

00:06:24.046 --> 00:06:25.966 A:middle
Collecting raw data might reveal

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.756 A:middle
additional information about the

00:06:27.756 --> 00:06:28.356 A:middle
users.

00:06:28.766 --> 00:06:30.526 A:middle
And as mentioned, this is

00:06:30.526 --> 00:06:32.526 A:middle
information that neither your

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:34.266 A:middle
users nor you might want to

00:06:34.266 --> 00:06:34.546 A:middle
have.

00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:36.786 A:middle
As an example, consider you have

00:06:37.246 --> 00:06:39.036 A:middle
a new feature in your app, and

00:06:39.036 --> 00:06:40.126 A:middle
you're going to collect feedback

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:41.706 A:middle
to see how successful it is.

00:06:42.356 --> 00:06:44.766 A:middle
So, you could instrument your

00:06:44.766 --> 00:06:47.576 A:middle
app to send back a timestamp to

00:06:47.576 --> 00:06:49.636 A:middle
your server each time the users

00:06:49.636 --> 00:06:50.656 A:middle
engage with your feature.

00:06:51.626 --> 00:06:53.726 A:middle
And that would give you the

00:06:53.726 --> 00:06:54.726 A:middle
information you're after.

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:56.966 A:middle
But if you were to plot that

00:06:57.046 --> 00:06:59.146 A:middle
data over a timeline, you could

00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:01.316 A:middle
also learn that user one is a

00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:01.316 A:middle
also learn that user one is a

00:07:01.316 --> 00:07:03.376 A:middle
morning person, because all of

00:07:03.376 --> 00:07:04.776 A:middle
their timestamps are in the

00:07:04.776 --> 00:07:05.206 A:middle
morning.

00:07:05.586 --> 00:07:07.656 A:middle
And user three opens your app at

00:07:07.696 --> 00:07:07.936 A:middle
night.

00:07:09.276 --> 00:07:11.656 A:middle
So, another way to collect this

00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:12.976 A:middle
information would be to say,

00:07:12.976 --> 00:07:15.996 A:middle
''Well, I will have my app count

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:19.536 A:middle
the total number of times that a

00:07:19.536 --> 00:07:21.236 A:middle
particular user engages with my

00:07:21.326 --> 00:07:23.186 A:middle
feature, and send that count

00:07:23.226 --> 00:07:25.626 A:middle
back to my server, once a day.''

00:07:26.026 --> 00:07:28.136 A:middle
And that is a more privacy

00:07:28.196 --> 00:07:30.366 A:middle
friendly way to learn the same

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:31.586 A:middle
information about the feature,

00:07:32.246 --> 00:07:34.046 A:middle
whether it's a customer or not.

00:07:34.896 --> 00:07:36.426 A:middle
But if you pay attention, you

00:07:36.426 --> 00:07:37.996 A:middle
might realize that now you know

00:07:37.996 --> 00:07:40.956 A:middle
that user one likes your feature

00:07:40.956 --> 00:07:44.386 A:middle
the most, among your users.

00:07:44.816 --> 00:07:46.416 A:middle
And that's not the question you

00:07:46.416 --> 00:07:47.296 A:middle
were trying to answer.

00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:49.866 A:middle
So, if you were to rephrase the

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:52.666 A:middle
question as, ''How many users

00:07:52.666 --> 00:07:54.916 A:middle
engage with my feature more than

00:07:54.916 --> 00:07:56.736 A:middle
ten times a day?'' you could

00:07:56.736 --> 00:07:58.486 A:middle
have your app send back to your

00:07:58.486 --> 00:08:00.996 A:middle
server, a Boolean flag, yes or

00:07:58.486 --> 00:08:00.996 A:middle
server, a Boolean flag, yes or

00:08:00.996 --> 00:08:02.676 A:middle
no, whether the user has

00:08:02.676 --> 00:08:04.406 A:middle
exceeded that threshold within

00:08:04.406 --> 00:08:04.746 A:middle
the day.

00:08:06.056 --> 00:08:08.056 A:middle
And on your end, on the server,

00:08:08.456 --> 00:08:10.116 A:middle
you could calculate the

00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:11.866 A:middle
percentage of users that have

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:12.756 A:middle
exceeded the threshold.

00:08:12.756 --> 00:08:15.866 A:middle
In this particular case, 66%.

00:08:16.706 --> 00:08:18.396 A:middle
Keep that percentage on your

00:08:18.396 --> 00:08:20.056 A:middle
server, keep track of it over

00:08:20.056 --> 00:08:21.596 A:middle
time as it changes, to

00:08:21.596 --> 00:08:22.796 A:middle
understand how your feature

00:08:23.396 --> 00:08:26.926 A:middle
behaves, and discard any user

00:08:26.926 --> 00:08:29.576 A:middle
specific data.

00:08:29.756 --> 00:08:31.516 A:middle
So, now let's go over some

00:08:31.516 --> 00:08:33.746 A:middle
updates which might affect your

00:08:33.926 --> 00:08:34.176 A:middle
apps.

00:08:35.186 --> 00:08:37.385 A:middle
I mentioned, earlier, that when

00:08:37.515 --> 00:08:40.726 A:middle
apps ask for access to user data

00:08:40.726 --> 00:08:43.246 A:middle
iOS will prompt users for their

00:08:43.246 --> 00:08:43.616 A:middle
consent.

00:08:44.656 --> 00:08:46.216 A:middle
And there are cases where we

00:08:46.216 --> 00:08:48.946 A:middle
think that users need as much

00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:50.956 A:middle
information as possible to make

00:08:51.036 --> 00:08:51.656 A:middle
this decision.

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:55.056 A:middle
And your app is responsible for

00:08:55.056 --> 00:08:56.146 A:middle
providing this additional

00:08:56.176 --> 00:08:56.706 A:middle
context.

00:08:57.646 --> 00:08:59.316 A:middle
This additional context is in

00:08:59.316 --> 00:09:00.646 A:middle
the form of Purpose Strings.

00:08:59.316 --> 00:09:00.646 A:middle
the form of Purpose Strings.

00:09:00.926 --> 00:09:02.496 A:middle
And Purpose Strings are included

00:09:02.556 --> 00:09:04.356 A:middle
in the prompt shown to the user

00:09:04.356 --> 00:09:05.216 A:middle
by iOS.

00:09:06.116 --> 00:09:07.456 A:middle
Purpose Strings are defined as

00:09:07.616 --> 00:09:10.046 A:middle
keys in the Info.plist file of

00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:10.456 A:middle
your app.

00:09:12.016 --> 00:09:15.116 A:middle
And you can define those keys in

00:09:15.116 --> 00:09:15.976 A:middle
Xcode, like so.

00:09:16.526 --> 00:09:20.066 A:middle
Keep in mind that those keys are

00:09:20.396 --> 00:09:21.106 A:middle
mandatory.

00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:24.466 A:middle
So, if your app is missing a

00:09:24.526 --> 00:09:26.186 A:middle
Purpose String and tries to

00:09:26.186 --> 00:09:29.586 A:middle
access related data, it will

00:09:29.586 --> 00:09:31.686 A:middle
terminate with an error message

00:09:31.686 --> 00:09:33.816 A:middle
indicating which key is missing.

00:09:34.396 --> 00:09:38.076 A:middle
In iOS 10, these are the cases

00:09:38.076 --> 00:09:39.026 A:middle
where Purpose Strings are

00:09:39.026 --> 00:09:39.456 A:middle
required.

00:09:40.426 --> 00:09:42.956 A:middle
And in iOS 11, we are making

00:09:42.956 --> 00:09:46.196 A:middle
changes to Location, Photos, and

00:09:46.196 --> 00:09:47.406 A:middle
we're adding a Purpose String

00:09:47.496 --> 00:09:49.166 A:middle
for Core NFC.

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:54.026 A:middle
Core location has enabled great

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:55.296 A:middle
features in your apps.

00:09:55.876 --> 00:09:59.706 A:middle
Users appreciate being able to

00:09:59.706 --> 00:10:03.706 A:middle
navigate the world and find

00:09:59.706 --> 00:10:03.706 A:middle
navigate the world and find

00:10:03.706 --> 00:10:05.516 A:middle
interesting places through their

00:10:05.516 --> 00:10:05.916 A:middle
iOS device.

00:10:07.076 --> 00:10:10.296 A:middle
At the same time, we want users

00:10:10.296 --> 00:10:12.076 A:middle
to always be in control of their

00:10:12.076 --> 00:10:12.556 A:middle
privacy.

00:10:13.636 --> 00:10:18.346 A:middle
So, in iOS 10 apps can ask for

00:10:18.546 --> 00:10:20.456 A:middle
access to the user's location at

00:10:20.456 --> 00:10:22.986 A:middle
all times, or while the app is

00:10:22.986 --> 00:10:24.146 A:middle
in use.

00:10:24.836 --> 00:10:29.526 A:middle
In iOS 11 users will be able to

00:10:29.576 --> 00:10:32.486 A:middle
choose the When In Use option at

00:10:32.486 --> 00:10:33.156 A:middle
all times.

00:10:34.516 --> 00:10:41.236 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:41.736 --> 00:10:43.246 A:middle
What this means for you, is that

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:47.006 A:middle
your app will have to account

00:10:47.126 --> 00:10:49.076 A:middle
for cases where the user's

00:10:49.076 --> 00:10:51.116 A:middle
location is not available to

00:10:51.116 --> 00:10:51.276 A:middle
you.

00:10:51.716 --> 00:10:52.926 A:middle
And you need to define

00:10:52.976 --> 00:10:54.556 A:middle
additional Purpose Strings for

00:10:54.556 --> 00:10:55.466 A:middle
the When In Use option.

00:10:56.696 --> 00:10:59.306 A:middle
As a reminder, when asking for

00:10:59.306 --> 00:11:01.226 A:middle
the user location make sure you

00:10:59.306 --> 00:11:01.226 A:middle
the user location make sure you

00:11:01.226 --> 00:11:02.446 A:middle
do it in a meaningful way.

00:11:03.306 --> 00:11:06.106 A:middle
Make sure you prompt after the

00:11:06.106 --> 00:11:07.876 A:middle
user has engaged the feature

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:09.796 A:middle
that requires their location, so

00:11:09.796 --> 00:11:10.926 A:middle
they understand why they're

00:11:10.926 --> 00:11:12.126 A:middle
being asked for their location.

00:11:13.106 --> 00:11:14.406 A:middle
When you prompt, make sure your

00:11:14.406 --> 00:11:16.546 A:middle
Purpose String provides the

00:11:16.546 --> 00:11:18.406 A:middle
necessary information for the

00:11:18.406 --> 00:11:20.436 A:middle
user to make a good decision.

00:11:21.406 --> 00:11:24.336 A:middle
And if possible, try asking for

00:11:24.576 --> 00:11:26.776 A:middle
When In Use, and escalate to

00:11:26.776 --> 00:11:29.126 A:middle
Always after the user has some

00:11:29.126 --> 00:11:31.586 A:middle
time to experience your feature.

00:11:32.126 --> 00:11:36.996 A:middle
If you have an app on iOS 10

00:11:37.076 --> 00:11:39.416 A:middle
that does not support the When

00:11:39.416 --> 00:11:41.546 A:middle
In Use option, this is the

00:11:41.546 --> 00:11:43.836 A:middle
prompt the user will see when

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:45.566 A:middle
they upgrade to iOS 11.

00:11:46.366 --> 00:11:48.526 A:middle
As you can see, they can choose

00:11:48.526 --> 00:11:50.656 A:middle
the When In Use option, but

00:11:50.656 --> 00:11:51.966 A:middle
there is a warning that the app

00:11:51.966 --> 00:11:54.526 A:middle
does not natively support it.

00:11:57.376 --> 00:11:59.556 A:middle
If you have an app on iOS 10

00:11:59.866 --> 00:12:01.996 A:middle
that does support both the When

00:11:59.866 --> 00:12:01.996 A:middle
that does support both the When

00:12:01.996 --> 00:12:03.876 A:middle
In Use and the Always option,

00:12:04.486 --> 00:12:05.946 A:middle
this is the prompt you will see.

00:12:06.636 --> 00:12:08.236 A:middle
Both Purpose Strings will be

00:12:08.236 --> 00:12:09.886 A:middle
included in the prompt shown to

00:12:09.886 --> 00:12:10.346 A:middle
the user.

00:12:11.196 --> 00:12:12.886 A:middle
You should update your apps to

00:12:12.956 --> 00:12:14.336 A:middle
feature a single Purpose String.

00:12:14.746 --> 00:12:17.696 A:middle
And you can do that by defining

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:20.106 A:middle
a single key in your Info.plist

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.136 A:middle
file, and use the Always and

00:12:22.136 --> 00:12:24.936 A:middle
When In Use key.

00:12:25.176 --> 00:12:27.106 A:middle
So now, let's talk about Photos.

00:12:28.176 --> 00:12:29.366 A:middle
The user's Photos library

00:12:29.656 --> 00:12:30.986 A:middle
contains a lot of information.

00:12:31.586 --> 00:12:33.976 A:middle
And we want you to be able to

00:12:33.976 --> 00:12:35.506 A:middle
leverage that information to

00:12:35.506 --> 00:12:36.516 A:middle
deliver great features.

00:12:37.456 --> 00:12:38.716 A:middle
At the same time, we want to

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.266 A:middle
maintain a high level of user

00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:40.796 A:middle
privacy.

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.816 A:middle
So, this year, we're adding two

00:12:43.816 --> 00:12:46.076 A:middle
new ways for your apps to

00:12:46.076 --> 00:12:47.526 A:middle
interact with the Photos

00:12:47.526 --> 00:12:47.976 A:middle
library.

00:12:49.066 --> 00:12:51.356 A:middle
Specifically, users will be able

00:12:51.356 --> 00:12:53.986 A:middle
to open a photo in your app

00:12:54.256 --> 00:12:55.516 A:middle
without the need for you to

00:12:55.516 --> 00:12:57.296 A:middle
prompt for access to their

00:12:57.296 --> 00:12:59.116 A:middle
entire Photos library.

00:12:59.506 --> 00:13:02.956 A:middle
So, this will make them more

00:12:59.506 --> 00:13:02.956 A:middle
So, this will make them more

00:13:02.956 --> 00:13:04.706 A:middle
comfortable using your app,

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:06.886 A:middle
because they will have better

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:08.406 A:middle
control over their data.

00:13:09.526 --> 00:13:12.456 A:middle
We're also, adding a Write only

00:13:12.606 --> 00:13:14.476 A:middle
access to the Photos library.

00:13:15.286 --> 00:13:16.916 A:middle
So, for example, if there's a

00:13:16.916 --> 00:13:18.376 A:middle
game that wants to save a

00:13:18.376 --> 00:13:20.016 A:middle
screenshot of the user

00:13:20.016 --> 00:13:22.236 A:middle
achievements, it can prompt for

00:13:22.236 --> 00:13:24.906 A:middle
Write, but not Read access to

00:13:24.906 --> 00:13:25.736 A:middle
the Photos library.

00:13:26.496 --> 00:13:28.456 A:middle
And users might be more willing

00:13:28.456 --> 00:13:29.566 A:middle
to grant that request.

00:13:30.986 --> 00:13:32.176 A:middle
And because of these changes,

00:13:32.926 --> 00:13:37.136 A:middle
when users upgrade their devices

00:13:37.406 --> 00:13:39.916 A:middle
to iOS 11, existing apps will

00:13:39.916 --> 00:13:41.966 A:middle
re-prompt for access to the

00:13:41.966 --> 00:13:42.646 A:middle
Photos library.

00:13:43.386 --> 00:13:44.676 A:middle
If you want users to be able to

00:13:44.676 --> 00:13:47.006 A:middle
take advantage of this ability

00:13:47.006 --> 00:13:49.086 A:middle
to open Photos in your app

00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:52.476 A:middle
without being prompted, you can

00:13:52.476 --> 00:13:54.666 A:middle
adopt the Out Of Process Image

00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:56.706 A:middle
Picker, and to find out more,

00:13:57.206 --> 00:13:58.906 A:middle
please visit the Photos session.

00:13:59.326 --> 00:14:03.576 A:middle
This is a great way to add a

00:13:59.326 --> 00:14:03.576 A:middle
This is a great way to add a

00:14:03.666 --> 00:14:06.996 A:middle
photo in a user's profile or use

00:14:06.996 --> 00:14:08.016 A:middle
a photo in some other rare

00:14:08.016 --> 00:14:08.776 A:middle
action in your app.

00:14:08.776 --> 00:14:11.786 A:middle
Now let's look at the Write 0nly

00:14:11.786 --> 00:14:12.366 A:middle
case.

00:14:13.846 --> 00:14:15.556 A:middle
There is a prompt and a Purpose

00:14:15.556 --> 00:14:17.566 A:middle
String, so if you want to adopt

00:14:17.566 --> 00:14:18.626 A:middle
this, you need to decode the

00:14:18.626 --> 00:14:19.176 A:middle
Purpose String.

00:14:19.886 --> 00:14:23.386 A:middle
And make sure you provide enough

00:14:23.386 --> 00:14:24.936 A:middle
information for the users to

00:14:24.936 --> 00:14:27.696 A:middle
decide whether they want to use

00:14:27.696 --> 00:14:28.186 A:middle
this feature.

00:14:28.186 --> 00:14:31.516 A:middle
Now, let's talk about Core NFC.

00:14:32.186 --> 00:14:34.196 A:middle
CoreNFC is a new and exciting

00:14:34.436 --> 00:14:36.876 A:middle
iOS 11 framework, which allows

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.676 A:middle
your app to use NFC reader modes

00:14:40.136 --> 00:14:42.536 A:middle
to interact with nearby NFC

00:14:42.636 --> 00:14:42.886 A:middle
tags.

00:14:43.576 --> 00:14:45.576 A:middle
So now, you can use NFC tags in

00:14:45.576 --> 00:14:47.366 A:middle
your app in novel and

00:14:47.366 --> 00:14:48.306 A:middle
interesting ways.

00:14:48.836 --> 00:14:52.306 A:middle
To adopt CoreNFC, you need to

00:14:52.306 --> 00:14:54.116 A:middle
declare the corresponding

00:14:54.116 --> 00:14:55.926 A:middle
Purpose String and provide the

00:14:55.926 --> 00:14:56.916 A:middle
necessary context.

00:14:57.716 --> 00:14:59.776 A:middle
And this Purpose String will be

00:14:59.776 --> 00:15:01.386 A:middle
included in the prompt shown to

00:14:59.776 --> 00:15:01.386 A:middle
included in the prompt shown to

00:15:01.386 --> 00:15:03.826 A:middle
the user every time your app

00:15:04.186 --> 00:15:05.276 A:middle
invokes CoreNFC.

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:08.536 A:middle
Now, let's talk about the watch.

00:15:09.636 --> 00:15:10.876 A:middle
We want your apps to be able to

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:12.136 A:middle
do more with the watch.

00:15:12.546 --> 00:15:15.126 A:middle
So, this year, we're expanding

00:15:15.426 --> 00:15:16.496 A:middle
the use of the microphone.

00:15:17.636 --> 00:15:21.466 A:middle
Today, in iOS 10, your app can

00:15:21.466 --> 00:15:24.036 A:middle
ask for microphone access, and

00:15:24.156 --> 00:15:26.136 A:middle
following the user's consent, it

00:15:26.136 --> 00:15:28.756 A:middle
can start recording audio while

00:15:28.756 --> 00:15:29.536 A:middle
in the foreground.

00:15:30.376 --> 00:15:31.656 A:middle
In the new version of watchOS,

00:15:32.576 --> 00:15:34.316 A:middle
you will be able to keep

00:15:34.316 --> 00:15:35.866 A:middle
recording while in the

00:15:35.866 --> 00:15:36.296 A:middle
background.

00:15:37.046 --> 00:15:37.986 A:middle
And if you stay in the

00:15:38.026 --> 00:15:40.536 A:middle
foreground you will be able to

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:43.116 A:middle
use the new API to record audio

00:15:43.406 --> 00:15:47.706 A:middle
without showing the built-in UI.

00:15:47.886 --> 00:15:49.436 A:middle
Because we want users to always

00:15:49.436 --> 00:15:51.056 A:middle
be aware that their microphone

00:15:51.056 --> 00:15:53.646 A:middle
is active, if your app is in the

00:15:53.646 --> 00:15:55.356 A:middle
background, there will be an

00:15:55.356 --> 00:15:56.856 A:middle
indicator on the watch face.

00:15:57.046 --> 00:15:58.826 A:middle
And if the user taps on the

00:15:58.826 --> 00:16:00.776 A:middle
indicator your app will enter

00:15:58.826 --> 00:16:00.776 A:middle
indicator your app will enter

00:16:00.776 --> 00:16:01.286 A:middle
the foreground.

00:16:01.866 --> 00:16:04.886 A:middle
Let's talk about Music.

00:16:06.496 --> 00:16:09.576 A:middle
We want your apps to be able to

00:16:09.576 --> 00:16:11.396 A:middle
take advantage of Music and

00:16:11.396 --> 00:16:12.956 A:middle
create great features.

00:16:14.026 --> 00:16:16.936 A:middle
So, part of this experience is

00:16:17.456 --> 00:16:19.816 A:middle
having a frictionless way to

00:16:19.816 --> 00:16:21.746 A:middle
authenticate the user while

00:16:21.746 --> 00:16:22.806 A:middle
respecting their privacy.

00:16:23.436 --> 00:16:24.786 A:middle
So, for example, if an app were

00:16:24.786 --> 00:16:26.536 A:middle
to ask for the user's password

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:28.486 A:middle
to Music, that would be a

00:16:28.486 --> 00:16:29.376 A:middle
privacy concern.

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:33.676 A:middle
Instead, apps should leverage

00:16:33.676 --> 00:16:35.106 A:middle
the fact that the users are

00:16:35.106 --> 00:16:37.326 A:middle
already signed into Music on

00:16:37.326 --> 00:16:37.776 A:middle
iOS.

00:16:38.326 --> 00:16:43.906 A:middle
And iOS has a built-in mediation

00:16:43.906 --> 00:16:46.336 A:middle
mechanism for giving your apps

00:16:46.376 --> 00:16:48.376 A:middle
access to a Music token.

00:16:49.386 --> 00:16:50.686 A:middle
Following the user's consent,

00:16:51.446 --> 00:16:53.456 A:middle
you can get that token and use

00:16:53.456 --> 00:16:58.756 A:middle
it to access output APIs to

00:16:59.656 --> 00:17:02.636 A:middle
retrieve personalized and

00:16:59.656 --> 00:17:02.636 A:middle
retrieve personalized and

00:17:02.636 --> 00:17:04.116 A:middle
non-personalized information.

00:17:04.486 --> 00:17:07.215 A:middle
For example, search the iTunes

00:17:07.215 --> 00:17:09.935 A:middle
catalog or get information about

00:17:09.935 --> 00:17:10.846 A:middle
the user's library.

00:17:11.336 --> 00:17:14.536 A:middle
And remember, because the user

00:17:14.536 --> 00:17:16.036 A:middle
will have control over which

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:18.866 A:middle
apps get this token, make sure

00:17:19.326 --> 00:17:21.486 A:middle
you provide the necessary

00:17:21.486 --> 00:17:22.876 A:middle
context in the Purpose String

00:17:23.266 --> 00:17:25.356 A:middle
for users to understand what you

00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:25.976 A:middle
want to do with it.

00:17:25.976 --> 00:17:29.616 A:middle
Now, let's talk about Safari

00:17:29.616 --> 00:17:30.136 A:middle
View Controller.

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:31.946 A:middle
Safari View Controller is a

00:17:31.946 --> 00:17:33.676 A:middle
great way for users to browse

00:17:33.676 --> 00:17:34.976 A:middle
the web in your apps.

00:17:36.116 --> 00:17:40.466 A:middle
And in iOS 10 Safari cookies and

00:17:40.466 --> 00:17:42.886 A:middle
website data were available in

00:17:43.046 --> 00:17:44.976 A:middle
SVC instances, in Safari View

00:17:44.976 --> 00:17:46.836 A:middle
Controller instances, in your

00:17:46.836 --> 00:17:47.236 A:middle
apps.

00:17:48.286 --> 00:17:49.446 A:middle
This will change.

00:17:50.386 --> 00:17:52.996 A:middle
Now, in iOS 11 users will be

00:17:52.996 --> 00:17:56.566 A:middle
able to use an account to log in

00:17:56.566 --> 00:17:58.756 A:middle
a website in your app and

00:17:58.756 --> 00:18:00.346 A:middle
perhaps, use a different account

00:17:58.756 --> 00:18:00.346 A:middle
perhaps, use a different account

00:18:00.346 --> 00:18:02.086 A:middle
if they want to, to log into the

00:18:02.156 --> 00:18:04.066 A:middle
same website in Safari, or some

00:18:04.066 --> 00:18:04.626 A:middle
other app.

00:18:05.936 --> 00:18:07.456 A:middle
And we think that gives users

00:18:07.456 --> 00:18:08.196 A:middle
more control.

00:18:08.966 --> 00:18:10.486 A:middle
Specifically, what this means is

00:18:10.486 --> 00:18:12.806 A:middle
that Safari and Safari View

00:18:12.806 --> 00:18:14.846 A:middle
Controller instances will have

00:18:14.846 --> 00:18:17.486 A:middle
separate data stores for cookies

00:18:17.716 --> 00:18:18.736 A:middle
and other website's data.

00:18:19.816 --> 00:18:21.186 A:middle
And what this means for you and

00:18:21.186 --> 00:18:22.876 A:middle
your users, is that they will

00:18:22.876 --> 00:18:24.936 A:middle
still be able to browse the web

00:18:24.986 --> 00:18:26.496 A:middle
in your app the same way as

00:18:26.496 --> 00:18:26.916 A:middle
before.

00:18:27.456 --> 00:18:29.596 A:middle
But they may have to login,

00:18:29.596 --> 00:18:31.706 A:middle
again, to some of the sites they

00:18:32.246 --> 00:18:32.446 A:middle
visit.

00:18:34.596 --> 00:18:36.486 A:middle
This is what it looks like.

00:18:37.016 --> 00:18:39.276 A:middle
So, for example, I have

00:18:39.346 --> 00:18:41.566 A:middle
Apple.com cookies in Safari, and

00:18:41.566 --> 00:18:44.006 A:middle
I have different cookies in your

00:18:44.276 --> 00:18:44.416 A:middle
app.

00:18:45.436 --> 00:18:48.226 A:middle
So, this concludes the updates.

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.246 A:middle
At this point, I would like to

00:18:50.246 --> 00:18:52.236 A:middle
invite Katie onstage to tell you

00:18:52.236 --> 00:18:53.716 A:middle
all about some exciting new

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:55.546 A:middle
privacy features that Apple is

00:18:55.546 --> 00:18:56.266 A:middle
launching, this year.

00:18:56.936 --> 00:18:57.206 A:middle
Katie.

00:18:58.516 --> 00:19:02.626 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:58.516 --> 00:19:02.626 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:03.126 --> 00:19:04.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Georgios.

00:19:05.486 --> 00:19:06.656 A:middle
Now, I'm going to focus on some

00:19:06.656 --> 00:19:08.756 A:middle
new privacy features, as well as

00:19:08.756 --> 00:19:09.906 A:middle
provide an update on

00:19:09.906 --> 00:19:11.736 A:middle
differential privacy, that we

00:19:11.736 --> 00:19:12.836 A:middle
introduced last year.

00:19:12.836 --> 00:19:15.026 A:middle
I'm going to start with on

00:19:15.026 --> 00:19:16.126 A:middle
device processing.

00:19:16.886 --> 00:19:18.516 A:middle
Now, On-Device processing has a

00:19:18.516 --> 00:19:19.916 A:middle
lot of benefits.

00:19:20.056 --> 00:19:21.456 A:middle
One of the first ones, is it

00:19:21.456 --> 00:19:23.686 A:middle
enables your functionality to

00:19:23.686 --> 00:19:25.586 A:middle
run anywhere your users are.

00:19:26.056 --> 00:19:27.136 A:middle
Whether they're at the beach,

00:19:27.206 --> 00:19:29.316 A:middle
like this, or on an airplane

00:19:29.316 --> 00:19:31.706 A:middle
flight, or even in areas of poor

00:19:31.706 --> 00:19:33.226 A:middle
cellular connectivity.

00:19:34.496 --> 00:19:36.636 A:middle
It also, avoids network latency,

00:19:36.636 --> 00:19:38.986 A:middle
as depending on where your users

00:19:38.986 --> 00:19:41.186 A:middle
are, this may take longer than

00:19:41.186 --> 00:19:42.786 A:middle
the actual processing that you

00:19:42.786 --> 00:19:43.826 A:middle
want to accomplish.

00:19:44.376 --> 00:19:47.116 A:middle
The speed of our devices, your

00:19:47.306 --> 00:19:49.506 A:middle
iPhones, our iPads, it keeps

00:19:49.506 --> 00:19:51.256 A:middle
increasing and increasing.

00:19:52.526 --> 00:19:56.916 A:middle
The iPhone 7 is 120 times the

00:19:56.916 --> 00:19:58.916 A:middle
processing power of the original

00:19:58.916 --> 00:19:59.336 A:middle
iPhone.

00:20:00.746 --> 00:20:02.996 A:middle
So, think through the different

00:20:02.996 --> 00:20:04.566 A:middle
tasks that you once thought were

00:20:04.566 --> 00:20:06.986 A:middle
not feasible on device, and you

00:20:06.986 --> 00:20:07.876 A:middle
should reconsider.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:11.136 A:middle
Now, as you all are at the

00:20:11.136 --> 00:20:12.776 A:middle
privacy session, I'm going to

00:20:12.776 --> 00:20:13.856 A:middle
talk a little bit more about the

00:20:13.966 --> 00:20:15.946 A:middle
privacy related benefits of

00:20:15.946 --> 00:20:17.116 A:middle
On-Device processing.

00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:20.646 A:middle
One of the first ones is access

00:20:20.646 --> 00:20:21.256 A:middle
to user data.

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:23.546 A:middle
So, there are many different

00:20:23.546 --> 00:20:24.896 A:middle
types of sensitive data on

00:20:24.896 --> 00:20:25.356 A:middle
device.

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.226 A:middle
And when you're clear to your

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.556 A:middle
users about how you plan to use

00:20:29.556 --> 00:20:29.996 A:middle
that data.

00:20:30.636 --> 00:20:32.946 A:middle
Like for instance, if you tell

00:20:32.946 --> 00:20:34.996 A:middle
your users that the photo that

00:20:34.996 --> 00:20:37.596 A:middle
you take, if you apply a nice

00:20:37.596 --> 00:20:40.026 A:middle
halo on it, maybe a filter, that

00:20:40.026 --> 00:20:41.416 A:middle
stays on their device.

00:20:41.576 --> 00:20:43.856 A:middle
Until they choose to share it

00:20:43.856 --> 00:20:45.886 A:middle
with another user, or maybe back

00:20:45.886 --> 00:20:46.566 A:middle
it up with you.

00:20:47.616 --> 00:20:49.046 A:middle
Then, users are going to be more

00:20:49.046 --> 00:20:51.396 A:middle
likely to want to grant you

00:20:51.396 --> 00:20:53.086 A:middle
access to their data, and feel

00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:55.606 A:middle
more comfortable about it.

00:20:55.976 --> 00:20:57.536 A:middle
On-Device, you can also take

00:20:57.536 --> 00:20:59.316 A:middle
advantage of all the different

00:20:59.356 --> 00:21:01.426 A:middle
security features that are built

00:20:59.356 --> 00:21:01.426 A:middle
security features that are built

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:02.596 A:middle
into our platforms.

00:21:03.756 --> 00:21:05.566 A:middle
These are things like data

00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:08.196 A:middle
protection, the Keychain, that

00:21:08.196 --> 00:21:10.826 A:middle
allow you to more securely take

00:21:10.826 --> 00:21:12.926 A:middle
care of user's data, without you

00:21:12.926 --> 00:21:14.126 A:middle
having to implement it,

00:21:14.126 --> 00:21:14.456 A:middle
yourself.

00:21:14.456 --> 00:21:17.796 A:middle
Now, in past developer sessions,

00:21:18.196 --> 00:21:19.726 A:middle
they're a great resource for you

00:21:19.726 --> 00:21:22.026 A:middle
to go and learn more about these

00:21:22.026 --> 00:21:23.026 A:middle
security features.

00:21:23.586 --> 00:21:25.106 A:middle
I would encourage you to go

00:21:25.106 --> 00:21:27.076 A:middle
check out ''Protecting Secrets

00:21:27.076 --> 00:21:27.786 A:middle
With the Keychain''.

00:21:27.866 --> 00:21:29.206 A:middle
It's a great place to start.

00:21:30.866 --> 00:21:33.036 A:middle
Now, when you're using and

00:21:33.036 --> 00:21:34.976 A:middle
keeping the data on device, that

00:21:34.976 --> 00:21:36.516 A:middle
means you don't have to write

00:21:36.676 --> 00:21:39.786 A:middle
code to send that data to your

00:21:39.786 --> 00:21:40.326 A:middle
server.

00:21:41.406 --> 00:21:43.306 A:middle
You don't have to write code to

00:21:43.306 --> 00:21:45.916 A:middle
securely manage and make sure

00:21:45.916 --> 00:21:47.356 A:middle
that, that data on your server

00:21:47.726 --> 00:21:48.456 A:middle
is secure.

00:21:49.286 --> 00:21:51.786 A:middle
Now, you all know the less code

00:21:51.786 --> 00:21:54.086 A:middle
you have to write, that means

00:21:54.196 --> 00:21:54.846 A:middle
the less bugs.

00:21:55.366 --> 00:21:58.116 A:middle
And the less bugs are less bugs

00:21:58.116 --> 00:21:59.336 A:middle
that an attacker can take

00:21:59.336 --> 00:22:00.086 A:middle
advantage of.

00:21:59.336 --> 00:22:00.086 A:middle
advantage of.

00:22:00.826 --> 00:22:02.776 A:middle
Because a data breach is very

00:22:02.846 --> 00:22:04.056 A:middle
serious, and there are a lot of

00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:05.096 A:middle
consequences.

00:22:05.496 --> 00:22:07.356 A:middle
But one of the consequences is

00:22:07.356 --> 00:22:09.346 A:middle
the loss of user trust.

00:22:10.916 --> 00:22:13.416 A:middle
Now, technologies like this can

00:22:13.596 --> 00:22:15.566 A:middle
help you avoid that, as well.

00:22:15.566 --> 00:22:18.876 A:middle
Now, I'm going to talk about

00:22:19.016 --> 00:22:21.736 A:middle
four new frameworks that allow

00:22:21.736 --> 00:22:24.376 A:middle
you to do these common tasks on

00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:24.826 A:middle
device.

00:22:25.546 --> 00:22:27.436 A:middle
Now, any type of processing that

00:22:27.436 --> 00:22:29.926 A:middle
you do within your app, you can

00:22:29.926 --> 00:22:30.956 A:middle
move to on device.

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:32.666 A:middle
But here are four frameworks

00:22:32.716 --> 00:22:33.656 A:middle
that make it easier.

00:22:34.316 --> 00:22:36.536 A:middle
The first one is CoreML, Core

00:22:36.536 --> 00:22:37.336 A:middle
Machine Learning.

00:22:38.136 --> 00:22:40.306 A:middle
Now, this allows you to have a

00:22:40.376 --> 00:22:42.216 A:middle
simple interface to load and run

00:22:42.366 --> 00:22:43.306 A:middle
pretrained models.

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:45.296 A:middle
There a lot of different models

00:22:45.296 --> 00:22:46.136 A:middle
that it supports.

00:22:46.806 --> 00:22:47.996 A:middle
But one of them is neural

00:22:47.996 --> 00:22:48.396 A:middle
networks.

00:22:48.696 --> 00:22:50.836 A:middle
The second framework I'm going

00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:52.106 A:middle
to talk about is VisionKit.

00:22:53.346 --> 00:22:54.756 A:middle
Now, VisionKit allows you to

00:22:54.756 --> 00:22:57.276 A:middle
identify faces within a photo,

00:22:58.096 --> 00:22:59.266 A:middle
as well as do scene

00:22:59.266 --> 00:23:02.626 A:middle
classification, and group photos

00:22:59.266 --> 00:23:02.626 A:middle
classification, and group photos

00:23:02.956 --> 00:23:04.816 A:middle
by the contents of the scene and

00:23:04.816 --> 00:23:05.276 A:middle
time.

00:23:05.546 --> 00:23:08.316 A:middle
One of the ones that I'm most

00:23:08.316 --> 00:23:09.986 A:middle
excited about is ARKit.

00:23:10.196 --> 00:23:12.246 A:middle
I think augmented reality is a

00:23:12.246 --> 00:23:13.326 A:middle
place where there's lots of

00:23:13.326 --> 00:23:14.496 A:middle
exciting things to come.

00:23:14.496 --> 00:23:16.046 A:middle
And I can't wait to get it in

00:23:16.126 --> 00:23:17.916 A:middle
all of your hands, to see what

00:23:17.916 --> 00:23:19.396 A:middle
kind of experiences you guys

00:23:19.716 --> 00:23:20.726 A:middle
create for our users.

00:23:21.896 --> 00:23:24.276 A:middle
Now, ARKit can allow you to

00:23:24.276 --> 00:23:26.666 A:middle
locate the device, as well as

00:23:26.666 --> 00:23:27.966 A:middle
items in the real world.

00:23:28.556 --> 00:23:29.926 A:middle
And then, it allows you to

00:23:29.976 --> 00:23:31.976 A:middle
augment on top of a camera

00:23:32.026 --> 00:23:32.556 A:middle
stream.

00:23:33.846 --> 00:23:36.376 A:middle
Now, lastly, we have NLP,

00:23:36.376 --> 00:23:37.766 A:middle
Natural Language Processing.

00:23:38.286 --> 00:23:39.856 A:middle
This allows you to identify what

00:23:39.856 --> 00:23:42.316 A:middle
language a customer may have be

00:23:42.316 --> 00:23:43.556 A:middle
entering text with, then.

00:23:44.066 --> 00:23:45.486 A:middle
And it also allows you to do

00:23:45.486 --> 00:23:47.586 A:middle
tokenization, as well as named

00:23:47.586 --> 00:23:49.096 A:middle
entity recognition.

00:23:49.866 --> 00:23:51.666 A:middle
Now, I'd encourage you to go

00:23:51.666 --> 00:23:53.616 A:middle
check out the talk introducing

00:23:53.616 --> 00:23:56.566 A:middle
CoreML, later this afternoon.

00:23:57.326 --> 00:23:59.416 A:middle
This will provide an overview of

00:23:59.416 --> 00:24:02.126 A:middle
the different features available

00:23:59.416 --> 00:24:02.126 A:middle
the different features available

00:24:02.126 --> 00:24:03.466 A:middle
that you can take advantage of

00:24:03.556 --> 00:24:04.106 A:middle
on device.

00:24:04.726 --> 00:24:07.976 A:middle
Next, I'm going to talk about a

00:24:07.976 --> 00:24:11.516 A:middle
new framework available in iOS

00:24:11.576 --> 00:24:11.816 A:middle
and tvOS.

00:24:12.996 --> 00:24:13.916 A:middle
It's called Device Check.

00:24:15.016 --> 00:24:16.846 A:middle
Now, there are many developers

00:24:17.116 --> 00:24:18.546 A:middle
who are currently using a

00:24:18.546 --> 00:24:20.666 A:middle
variety of techniques to try to

00:24:20.666 --> 00:24:21.876 A:middle
identify devices.

00:24:22.996 --> 00:24:24.386 A:middle
Now, they may be trying to

00:24:24.386 --> 00:24:26.226 A:middle
identify and answer questions

00:24:26.226 --> 00:24:28.676 A:middle
like, ''Has this device received

00:24:28.676 --> 00:24:29.376 A:middle
a free trial?

00:24:30.236 --> 00:24:32.466 A:middle
Has this device participated in

00:24:32.466 --> 00:24:35.116 A:middle
fraudulent activity?'' Or, ''Has

00:24:35.156 --> 00:24:37.416 A:middle
this device done something that

00:24:37.416 --> 00:24:39.716 A:middle
is against your app's developer

00:24:39.716 --> 00:24:43.406 A:middle
guidelines?'' Now, in order to

00:24:43.406 --> 00:24:44.926 A:middle
achieve that goal, many

00:24:44.926 --> 00:24:46.386 A:middle
developers, though, I'm sure

00:24:46.386 --> 00:24:48.726 A:middle
none of you in this room, may be

00:24:48.956 --> 00:24:50.756 A:middle
collecting lots of information

00:24:50.816 --> 00:24:52.856 A:middle
in order to associate some state

00:24:53.646 --> 00:24:54.976 A:middle
with that device.

00:24:54.976 --> 00:24:58.256 A:middle
Now, to do that, they may be

00:24:58.256 --> 00:24:59.696 A:middle
collecting lots of information

00:24:59.696 --> 00:25:01.596 A:middle
like, how's the device set up?

00:24:59.696 --> 00:25:01.596 A:middle
like, how's the device set up?

00:25:02.856 --> 00:25:04.266 A:middle
What information is stored on

00:25:05.916 --> 00:25:05.986 A:middle
it?

00:25:05.986 --> 00:25:07.496 A:middle
And these developers may not

00:25:07.496 --> 00:25:08.756 A:middle
want to have this level of

00:25:08.756 --> 00:25:09.536 A:middle
information.

00:25:10.696 --> 00:25:12.266 A:middle
All they want to do is associate

00:25:12.266 --> 00:25:13.926 A:middle
some state with that device, in

00:25:13.926 --> 00:25:14.526 A:middle
particular.

00:25:16.626 --> 00:25:18.806 A:middle
Now, DeviceCheck allows you to

00:25:18.806 --> 00:25:20.626 A:middle
associate state with the device.

00:25:21.266 --> 00:25:22.866 A:middle
And this is done in a privacy

00:25:22.926 --> 00:25:24.766 A:middle
friendly way that you can

00:25:24.766 --> 00:25:26.186 A:middle
achieve without collecting

00:25:26.286 --> 00:25:27.996 A:middle
unnecessary information.

00:25:29.326 --> 00:25:30.676 A:middle
Now, DeviceCheck allows you to

00:25:30.676 --> 00:25:32.586 A:middle
store two bits of information,

00:25:32.806 --> 00:25:34.156 A:middle
as well as a timestamp

00:25:34.436 --> 00:25:35.996 A:middle
associated with one device.

00:25:35.996 --> 00:25:38.356 A:middle
And this is per team ID.

00:25:39.286 --> 00:25:45.396 A:middle
So, you can store 00, 01, 10, or

00:25:45.396 --> 00:25:45.816 A:middle
11.

00:25:46.656 --> 00:25:49.076 A:middle
And it's up to you to think

00:25:49.076 --> 00:25:52.966 A:middle
about what this means to your

00:25:53.056 --> 00:25:56.896 A:middle
application and your app logic.

00:25:57.046 --> 00:25:59.856 A:middle
Now, this information will be

00:25:59.856 --> 00:26:02.886 A:middle
maintained by Apple through

00:25:59.856 --> 00:26:02.886 A:middle
maintained by Apple through

00:26:03.246 --> 00:26:05.646 A:middle
until you reset it, or you

00:26:05.646 --> 00:26:06.786 A:middle
update the state.

00:26:07.236 --> 00:26:08.766 A:middle
So, this means it will be stored

00:26:08.766 --> 00:26:10.796 A:middle
by Apple through deletion of

00:26:11.406 --> 00:26:13.506 A:middle
your app, reinstallation of your

00:26:13.506 --> 00:26:15.846 A:middle
app, through erase all contents

00:26:15.846 --> 00:26:18.356 A:middle
and settings, as well as

00:26:18.686 --> 00:26:20.536 A:middle
transfer of that device between

00:26:20.536 --> 00:26:20.966 A:middle
users.

00:26:21.596 --> 00:26:23.436 A:middle
Now, we know users sell devices

00:26:23.436 --> 00:26:23.906 A:middle
to others.

00:26:24.256 --> 00:26:25.946 A:middle
We know they transfer them to

00:26:25.946 --> 00:26:27.496 A:middle
other siblings or other people

00:26:27.496 --> 00:26:27.956 A:middle
they know.

00:26:28.366 --> 00:26:29.756 A:middle
So, this information will be

00:26:29.756 --> 00:26:30.756 A:middle
maintained through that.

00:26:32.466 --> 00:26:34.046 A:middle
Now, as I mentioned before, it's

00:26:34.046 --> 00:26:36.056 A:middle
up to you to figure out what

00:26:36.056 --> 00:26:37.246 A:middle
these states mean to you.

00:26:37.246 --> 00:26:40.686 A:middle
So, an example would be for app

00:26:40.686 --> 00:26:42.526 A:middle
A, if a user has completed a

00:26:42.526 --> 00:26:45.076 A:middle
free trial they will be assigned

00:26:45.246 --> 00:26:46.126 A:middle
state 01.

00:26:47.186 --> 00:26:48.486 A:middle
Now, you could have a different

00:26:48.816 --> 00:26:49.386 A:middle
app, app B.

00:26:49.426 --> 00:26:51.526 A:middle
And that same information, that

00:26:51.596 --> 00:26:53.256 A:middle
same state that a free trial has

00:26:53.256 --> 00:26:55.346 A:middle
been assigned or completed could

00:26:55.346 --> 00:26:56.596 A:middle
be assigned 11.

00:26:57.556 --> 00:26:58.646 A:middle
It's up to you to make that

00:26:58.646 --> 00:26:59.126 A:middle
decision.

00:26:59.126 --> 00:27:01.786 A:middle
Now, I want to go through the

00:26:59.126 --> 00:27:01.786 A:middle
Now, I want to go through the

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:02.946 A:middle
flow and make sure you guys

00:27:02.946 --> 00:27:05.466 A:middle
understand how this works in

00:27:05.466 --> 00:27:06.096 A:middle
practice.

00:27:07.026 --> 00:27:07.956 A:middle
So, let's say there's an app

00:27:08.356 --> 00:27:09.486 A:middle
that's a news app.

00:27:09.486 --> 00:27:11.026 A:middle
And like I said before, it

00:27:11.026 --> 00:27:12.766 A:middle
grants a seven day free trial.

00:27:13.506 --> 00:27:15.856 A:middle
So, when my free trial is

00:27:15.896 --> 00:27:18.116 A:middle
completed the app wants to set

00:27:18.296 --> 00:27:19.896 A:middle
my state to 01.

00:27:20.516 --> 00:27:21.756 A:middle
So, first thing it's going to do

00:27:21.756 --> 00:27:23.286 A:middle
is query for a device check

00:27:23.386 --> 00:27:25.776 A:middle
token on device, send it to

00:27:25.776 --> 00:27:28.046 A:middle
their app server, and then via

00:27:28.326 --> 00:27:30.046 A:middle
server communication set the

00:27:30.046 --> 00:27:31.406 A:middle
state and send it to Apple.

00:27:32.026 --> 00:27:33.556 A:middle
So, send over the token and the

00:27:33.556 --> 00:27:36.916 A:middle
state that wants to be set.

00:27:36.916 --> 00:27:39.966 A:middle
So, then I decide that maybe I'm

00:27:39.966 --> 00:27:41.506 A:middle
not a huge fan of that news app,

00:27:41.506 --> 00:27:41.846 A:middle
anymore.

00:27:42.426 --> 00:27:44.106 A:middle
I want to delete it.

00:27:44.386 --> 00:27:46.236 A:middle
But then, I miss it couple of

00:27:46.236 --> 00:27:47.946 A:middle
weeks later, so I decide I'm

00:27:48.056 --> 00:27:49.946 A:middle
going to reinstall the app.

00:27:50.046 --> 00:27:52.026 A:middle
On launch, that app wants to

00:27:52.026 --> 00:27:55.586 A:middle
decide, ''should that user or

00:27:55.586 --> 00:27:56.936 A:middle
that device be given another

00:27:56.936 --> 00:27:57.586 A:middle
free trial''?

00:27:58.686 --> 00:28:01.216 A:middle
So, query for the token, send it

00:27:58.686 --> 00:28:01.216 A:middle
So, query for the token, send it

00:28:01.216 --> 00:28:02.446 A:middle
to the app server the same way,

00:28:02.676 --> 00:28:04.226 A:middle
and this time query for the

00:28:04.226 --> 00:28:05.346 A:middle
state of the device.

00:28:06.326 --> 00:28:10.446 A:middle
So, then because that device was

00:28:10.446 --> 00:28:12.856 A:middle
last set as 01, it will be sent

00:28:12.856 --> 00:28:13.816 A:middle
back to the app server.

00:28:13.906 --> 00:28:15.946 A:middle
And at that point it's the app's

00:28:15.946 --> 00:28:17.106 A:middle
job to figure out what to do,

00:28:17.106 --> 00:28:17.266 A:middle
next.

00:28:18.326 --> 00:28:19.986 A:middle
Should that device be granted

00:28:19.986 --> 00:28:20.906 A:middle
another free trial?

00:28:21.756 --> 00:28:23.826 A:middle
Should that device be granted,

00:28:23.826 --> 00:28:24.926 A:middle
maybe, a shorter trial?

00:28:25.666 --> 00:28:26.696 A:middle
Or no trial at all?

00:28:27.016 --> 00:28:29.386 A:middle
It's up to you to make that

00:28:31.316 --> 00:28:31.556 A:middle
decision.

00:28:31.646 --> 00:28:34.126 A:middle
So, as I said before, devices

00:28:34.126 --> 00:28:35.576 A:middle
can transfer between users.

00:28:36.316 --> 00:28:37.776 A:middle
So, let's say I sell my device

00:28:37.776 --> 00:28:38.866 A:middle
to Georgios, because I want a

00:28:38.866 --> 00:28:39.316 A:middle
different phone.

00:28:39.856 --> 00:28:41.556 A:middle
I want a new gold one, this

00:28:42.276 --> 00:28:42.396 A:middle
time.

00:28:42.496 --> 00:28:45.126 A:middle
So, then Georgios wants to

00:28:45.126 --> 00:28:46.036 A:middle
install the same app.

00:28:46.036 --> 00:28:47.306 A:middle
He likes the same news app.

00:28:47.796 --> 00:28:49.086 A:middle
So, it's going to query for the

00:28:49.086 --> 00:28:51.036 A:middle
token the same way, send it to

00:28:51.036 --> 00:28:53.316 A:middle
its app server, and then, query

00:28:53.316 --> 00:28:54.146 A:middle
for the state.

00:28:55.076 --> 00:28:57.426 A:middle
Again, 01 will be returned.

00:28:58.416 --> 00:29:00.816 A:middle
And this case, Georgios has not

00:28:58.416 --> 00:29:00.816 A:middle
And this case, Georgios has not

00:29:00.926 --> 00:29:01.896 A:middle
gotten a free trial.

00:29:02.176 --> 00:29:03.366 A:middle
So, you need to think about how

00:29:03.366 --> 00:29:04.836 A:middle
to handle these type of cases.

00:29:06.006 --> 00:29:08.486 A:middle
Now, make sure that you have a

00:29:08.486 --> 00:29:10.246 A:middle
way that customers can reach out

00:29:10.556 --> 00:29:12.676 A:middle
or escalate if they are

00:29:12.676 --> 00:29:14.236 A:middle
experiencing issues with this.

00:29:14.236 --> 00:29:16.026 A:middle
And they need to come and reach

00:29:16.026 --> 00:29:18.406 A:middle
out to you, because at Apple, we

00:29:18.406 --> 00:29:20.576 A:middle
don't have any idea what these

00:29:20.576 --> 00:29:21.756 A:middle
states correspond to.

00:29:21.956 --> 00:29:25.346 A:middle
So now, I'm going to quickly go

00:29:25.346 --> 00:29:26.466 A:middle
through what a sample query

00:29:26.466 --> 00:29:26.956 A:middle
could look like.

00:29:28.086 --> 00:29:29.026 A:middle
As you can see, here's the

00:29:29.026 --> 00:29:31.236 A:middle
device token, the transaction

00:29:31.236 --> 00:29:33.336 A:middle
ID, which you generate, as well

00:29:33.336 --> 00:29:33.996 A:middle
as a timestamp.

00:29:35.086 --> 00:29:36.736 A:middle
Then, here's the response from

00:29:36.736 --> 00:29:37.906 A:middle
Apple with the state.

00:29:38.606 --> 00:29:41.416 A:middle
And then, if you want to update

00:29:41.416 --> 00:29:43.356 A:middle
the state, again have the device

00:29:43.356 --> 00:29:46.726 A:middle
token, your transaction ID that

00:29:46.726 --> 00:29:48.286 A:middle
you generate, as well as the

00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:49.686 A:middle
timestamp and the state you want

00:29:50.426 --> 00:29:51.756 A:middle
to set.

00:29:51.986 --> 00:29:53.346 A:middle
When you're using DeviceCheck

00:29:53.626 --> 00:29:55.096 A:middle
make sure to think through these

00:29:55.096 --> 00:29:55.926 A:middle
best practices.

00:29:57.136 --> 00:29:58.646 A:middle
Make sure you handle the case

00:29:58.856 --> 00:30:00.306 A:middle
where devices are transferred

00:29:58.856 --> 00:30:00.306 A:middle
where devices are transferred

00:30:00.406 --> 00:30:00.976 A:middle
between users.

00:30:01.826 --> 00:30:04.696 A:middle
A device's behavior can change

00:30:04.696 --> 00:30:05.376 A:middle
over time.

00:30:06.846 --> 00:30:08.046 A:middle
Additionally, think about the

00:30:08.046 --> 00:30:09.056 A:middle
recency of the data.

00:30:10.166 --> 00:30:11.516 A:middle
If the state was set a year,

00:30:11.516 --> 00:30:13.516 A:middle
ago, maybe that means something

00:30:13.516 --> 00:30:15.196 A:middle
different to you than if it was

00:30:15.196 --> 00:30:15.816 A:middle
this month.

00:30:17.026 --> 00:30:18.606 A:middle
This should be part of your

00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:20.616 A:middle
app's logic, but not the sole

00:30:20.616 --> 00:30:21.106 A:middle
source.

00:30:21.826 --> 00:30:22.856 A:middle
And think through how you

00:30:22.856 --> 00:30:24.396 A:middle
represent this state in the UI.

00:30:25.436 --> 00:30:26.796 A:middle
When Georgios goes to launch the

00:30:26.796 --> 00:30:28.296 A:middle
app for the first time, you want

00:30:28.296 --> 00:30:29.686 A:middle
to have a fresh experience for

00:30:29.686 --> 00:30:29.976 A:middle
him.

00:30:30.796 --> 00:30:31.786 A:middle
So, make sure you think through

00:30:32.436 --> 00:30:32.526 A:middle
that.

00:30:33.306 --> 00:30:35.576 A:middle
Now, you should be using

00:30:35.656 --> 00:30:37.856 A:middle
platform supported identifiers.

00:30:38.746 --> 00:30:39.876 A:middle
These are the application

00:30:39.876 --> 00:30:41.576 A:middle
identifier, the vendor

00:30:41.576 --> 00:30:43.116 A:middle
identifier, as well as the

00:30:43.116 --> 00:30:44.456 A:middle
advertising identifier.

00:30:45.676 --> 00:30:47.296 A:middle
We will continue to remove and

00:30:47.296 --> 00:30:48.286 A:middle
to remove entropy on our

00:30:49.296 --> 00:30:50.546 A:middle
out-of-the-app sandbox.

00:30:50.906 --> 00:30:53.026 A:middle
And as we have before, we will

00:30:53.026 --> 00:30:54.566 A:middle
continue to identify areas of

00:30:54.566 --> 00:30:57.486 A:middle
entropy and put them either

00:30:57.556 --> 00:30:59.146 A:middle
behind user control or remove

00:30:59.146 --> 00:30:59.436 A:middle
them.

00:30:59.946 --> 00:31:03.896 A:middle
Next, I'm going to talk about

00:30:59.946 --> 00:31:03.896 A:middle
Next, I'm going to talk about

00:31:04.456 --> 00:31:06.076 A:middle
Intelligent Tracking Protection.

00:31:07.006 --> 00:31:08.096 A:middle
This year, we're working to

00:31:08.096 --> 00:31:10.466 A:middle
reduce cross-web tracking.

00:31:10.966 --> 00:31:14.156 A:middle
Now, since the beginning, WebKit

00:31:14.156 --> 00:31:15.626 A:middle
and Safari have been leaders in

00:31:15.626 --> 00:31:16.516 A:middle
user privacy.

00:31:17.746 --> 00:31:19.246 A:middle
One example of this is blocking

00:31:19.246 --> 00:31:20.936 A:middle
third party cookies by default.

00:31:22.326 --> 00:31:23.756 A:middle
Now, I want to get this out

00:31:23.756 --> 00:31:25.236 A:middle
there, that Intelligent Tracking

00:31:25.236 --> 00:31:26.796 A:middle
Protection is not about blocking

00:31:26.796 --> 00:31:27.226 A:middle
content.

00:31:27.506 --> 00:31:28.796 A:middle
That's not what this technology

00:31:30.426 --> 00:31:30.536 A:middle
is.

00:31:31.376 --> 00:31:33.016 A:middle
It dynamically detects online

00:31:33.016 --> 00:31:34.916 A:middle
tracking across the sites that a

00:31:34.916 --> 00:31:35.786 A:middle
user visits.

00:31:36.346 --> 00:31:37.786 A:middle
And using an on-device

00:31:37.876 --> 00:31:39.756 A:middle
classifier, it will identify

00:31:39.756 --> 00:31:40.756 A:middle
tracking domains.

00:31:41.386 --> 00:31:42.606 A:middle
Once a tracking domain is

00:31:42.606 --> 00:31:45.116 A:middle
identified, then it will isolate

00:31:45.346 --> 00:31:47.246 A:middle
the third party cookies, as well

00:31:47.246 --> 00:31:49.656 A:middle
as website data for that

00:31:49.656 --> 00:31:49.966 A:middle
website.

00:31:49.966 --> 00:31:52.166 A:middle
And then, periodically, that

00:31:52.166 --> 00:31:53.376 A:middle
data will be purged.

00:31:53.666 --> 00:31:56.306 A:middle
Now, if the user interacts with

00:31:56.306 --> 00:31:58.306 A:middle
that domain, that is taken as a

00:31:58.346 --> 00:31:59.726 A:middle
signal that the user is

00:31:59.726 --> 00:32:00.986 A:middle
interested in that website.

00:31:59.726 --> 00:32:00.986 A:middle
interested in that website.

00:32:00.986 --> 00:32:03.016 A:middle
And then, that website will be

00:32:03.016 --> 00:32:03.686 A:middle
whitelisted.

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:05.856 A:middle
So, let's go through an example.

00:32:06.856 --> 00:32:10.116 A:middle
So, if example.com is identified

00:32:10.116 --> 00:32:11.746 A:middle
as a tracker, and the user

00:32:11.746 --> 00:32:13.666 A:middle
visits site 1, that embeds

00:32:13.666 --> 00:32:16.046 A:middle
example.com, example.com will

00:32:16.046 --> 00:32:16.986 A:middle
set the cookie foo.

00:32:18.036 --> 00:32:20.256 A:middle
Now, a user goes to site 2,

00:32:20.606 --> 00:32:22.386 A:middle
which also embeds example.com,

00:32:22.846 --> 00:32:25.066 A:middle
but here, example.com does not

00:32:25.066 --> 00:32:26.176 A:middle
have access to the cookie foo.

00:32:26.176 --> 00:32:28.666 A:middle
So, then it will set cookie bar.

00:32:29.576 --> 00:32:31.596 A:middle
And then, over time these

00:32:31.596 --> 00:32:34.186 A:middle
cookies will be purged.

00:32:35.366 --> 00:32:37.986 A:middle
Now, no cookies will be deleted

00:32:37.986 --> 00:32:39.526 A:middle
from first party websites.

00:32:40.366 --> 00:32:41.496 A:middle
Additionally, if the user

00:32:41.496 --> 00:32:43.016 A:middle
interacts with your website via

00:32:43.016 --> 00:32:46.066 A:middle
click, a tap, entering a form,

00:32:46.656 --> 00:32:48.686 A:middle
then note it will be

00:32:48.686 --> 00:32:49.356 A:middle
whitelisted.

00:32:50.646 --> 00:32:53.066 A:middle
You should not rely on storage

00:32:53.696 --> 00:32:55.316 A:middle
if the user does not interact

00:32:55.386 --> 00:32:56.306 A:middle
with your website.

00:32:56.306 --> 00:32:59.456 A:middle
And this is an important one to

00:32:59.456 --> 00:33:01.976 A:middle
understand; if your analytics

00:32:59.456 --> 00:33:01.976 A:middle
understand; if your analytics

00:33:01.976 --> 00:33:03.856 A:middle
package relies on third party

00:33:03.856 --> 00:33:08.806 A:middle
cookies, they may be affected.

00:33:08.806 --> 00:33:09.916 A:middle
So, what we're trying to

00:33:09.916 --> 00:33:11.796 A:middle
achieve, here, is that users

00:33:11.796 --> 00:33:14.056 A:middle
only have long-term persistent

00:33:14.056 --> 00:33:16.396 A:middle
tracking and cookies from sites

00:33:16.396 --> 00:33:18.056 A:middle
that they actually intersect

00:33:18.056 --> 00:33:18.276 A:middle
with.

00:33:18.546 --> 00:33:21.126 A:middle
They actually interact with.

00:33:21.126 --> 00:33:22.926 A:middle
And then, all the other tracking

00:33:23.096 --> 00:33:24.826 A:middle
as the user navigates and visits

00:33:24.826 --> 00:33:27.116 A:middle
websites will be proactively

00:33:27.666 --> 00:33:27.846 A:middle
removed.

00:33:29.576 --> 00:33:31.846 A:middle
Lastly, we have an update on

00:33:31.846 --> 00:33:33.036 A:middle
Differential Privacy.

00:33:33.646 --> 00:33:36.026 A:middle
So, Differential Privacy was

00:33:36.026 --> 00:33:38.996 A:middle
launched on iOS and macOS, last

00:33:38.996 --> 00:33:39.116 A:middle
year.

00:33:39.856 --> 00:33:42.176 A:middle
Since then, we've collected

00:33:42.176 --> 00:33:44.456 A:middle
millions of privately donated

00:33:44.456 --> 00:33:47.536 A:middle
data per day, and it allowed us

00:33:47.576 --> 00:33:49.336 A:middle
to build user features with

00:33:49.366 --> 00:33:49.886 A:middle
privacy.

00:33:49.886 --> 00:33:53.576 A:middle
Now, I want to talk about two

00:33:53.576 --> 00:33:54.806 A:middle
new use cases, this year.

00:33:55.606 --> 00:33:58.876 A:middle
The first one is collecting what

00:33:58.956 --> 00:34:00.856 A:middle
data is commonly stored in

00:33:58.956 --> 00:34:00.856 A:middle
data is commonly stored in

00:34:00.856 --> 00:34:01.376 A:middle
HealthKit.

00:34:02.096 --> 00:34:03.676 A:middle
Now, one of the challenges of

00:34:03.676 --> 00:34:05.606 A:middle
working on sensitive features,

00:34:05.816 --> 00:34:07.376 A:middle
or features that have sensitive

00:34:07.376 --> 00:34:09.565 A:middle
data, is you want to understand

00:34:09.626 --> 00:34:10.936 A:middle
how those features are being

00:34:10.936 --> 00:34:11.396 A:middle
used.

00:34:12.266 --> 00:34:13.536 A:middle
You want to understand what's

00:34:13.536 --> 00:34:15.136 A:middle
resonating, where users are

00:34:15.136 --> 00:34:16.866 A:middle
falling into issues or errors

00:34:16.866 --> 00:34:17.505 A:middle
are occurring.

00:34:17.936 --> 00:34:19.466 A:middle
But you know that collecting

00:34:19.466 --> 00:34:21.956 A:middle
data about what they're actually

00:34:21.956 --> 00:34:23.626 A:middle
interacting with may have more

00:34:23.626 --> 00:34:24.676 A:middle
information than you really

00:34:24.676 --> 00:34:24.996 A:middle
need.

00:34:25.835 --> 00:34:28.076 A:middle
So, one example here is, if you

00:34:28.076 --> 00:34:30.295 A:middle
collect what type of data, what

00:34:30.295 --> 00:34:32.666 A:middle
data types the user has stored

00:34:32.666 --> 00:34:34.716 A:middle
on their device, things like

00:34:34.716 --> 00:34:35.835 A:middle
blood glucose.

00:34:35.896 --> 00:34:37.786 A:middle
Things like Workout, that could

00:34:37.786 --> 00:34:39.136 A:middle
convey other additional

00:34:39.136 --> 00:34:41.516 A:middle
information about their health

00:34:41.666 --> 00:34:43.906 A:middle
or about any conditions they

00:34:43.906 --> 00:34:45.366 A:middle
have, or how active they are.

00:34:45.366 --> 00:34:47.056 A:middle
And we don't really need that

00:34:47.056 --> 00:34:48.116 A:middle
level of information.

00:34:48.466 --> 00:34:50.056 A:middle
So, that's why it's so exciting

00:34:50.056 --> 00:34:51.386 A:middle
to have Differential Privacy at

00:34:51.386 --> 00:34:53.735 A:middle
Apple, because we can still get

00:34:53.735 --> 00:34:55.246 A:middle
information to continue to

00:34:55.246 --> 00:34:57.246 A:middle
iterate and build our features,

00:34:57.526 --> 00:34:59.306 A:middle
while respecting user privacy.

00:34:59.826 --> 00:35:02.806 A:middle
So, last year in the Privacy

00:34:59.826 --> 00:35:02.806 A:middle
So, last year in the Privacy

00:35:02.806 --> 00:35:04.056 A:middle
session at the Developer

00:35:04.056 --> 00:35:05.346 A:middle
Conference, Julian [assumed

00:35:05.346 --> 00:35:06.186 A:middle
spelling] did a great job

00:35:06.186 --> 00:35:07.476 A:middle
deep-diving into how

00:35:07.476 --> 00:35:08.956 A:middle
Differential Privacy works at

00:35:08.956 --> 00:35:09.236 A:middle
Apple.

00:35:10.756 --> 00:35:13.406 A:middle
Basically, we collect privatized

00:35:13.406 --> 00:35:16.426 A:middle
donations like emoji, and as

00:35:16.426 --> 00:35:18.116 A:middle
more and more users contribute

00:35:18.116 --> 00:35:19.896 A:middle
these privatized emojis, we

00:35:19.896 --> 00:35:21.546 A:middle
learn what are the most popular

00:35:22.006 --> 00:35:22.666 A:middle
emojis.

00:35:23.656 --> 00:35:25.766 A:middle
But the key part here, is we

00:35:25.766 --> 00:35:27.056 A:middle
learned nothing that's

00:35:27.056 --> 00:35:28.536 A:middle
associated by an individual

00:35:28.536 --> 00:35:28.956 A:middle
user.

00:35:29.966 --> 00:35:31.416 A:middle
For more information about how

00:35:31.416 --> 00:35:32.726 A:middle
Differential Privacy works at

00:35:32.726 --> 00:35:34.146 A:middle
Apple, I would encourage you all

00:35:34.146 --> 00:35:36.346 A:middle
to look at our session from last

00:35:36.346 --> 00:35:37.486 A:middle
year's Developer's Conference.

00:35:39.066 --> 00:35:42.256 A:middle
So, this year we're applying the

00:35:42.256 --> 00:35:44.096 A:middle
same process to health data

00:35:44.096 --> 00:35:44.446 A:middle
types.

00:35:45.096 --> 00:35:46.416 A:middle
So, we will learn the most

00:35:46.416 --> 00:35:48.376 A:middle
popular health data types, but

00:35:48.376 --> 00:35:49.606 A:middle
with learning nothing about the

00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:50.696 A:middle
individual user.

00:35:51.296 --> 00:35:56.976 A:middle
The second case is trying to

00:35:57.026 --> 00:35:59.826 A:middle
learn websites that either are

00:35:59.826 --> 00:36:02.356 A:middle
very slow or take up a lot of

00:35:59.826 --> 00:36:02.356 A:middle
very slow or take up a lot of

00:36:02.356 --> 00:36:03.216 A:middle
battery life.

00:36:03.966 --> 00:36:05.976 A:middle
We all want a fast, speedy web.

00:36:06.586 --> 00:36:08.646 A:middle
But we don't necessarily want to

00:36:08.646 --> 00:36:11.456 A:middle
learn everything that a user is

00:36:11.456 --> 00:36:11.986 A:middle
visiting.

00:36:12.406 --> 00:36:13.886 A:middle
That's a lot of information

00:36:13.926 --> 00:36:15.596 A:middle
about that user, depending on

00:36:15.696 --> 00:36:16.516 A:middle
their web searches.

00:36:17.276 --> 00:36:18.476 A:middle
So, this is another example

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:19.786 A:middle
where we get to use Differential

00:36:19.786 --> 00:36:21.796 A:middle
Privacy to then, reach out to

00:36:21.796 --> 00:36:23.746 A:middle
these developers who maybe, have

00:36:23.746 --> 00:36:25.086 A:middle
issues or are writing slow

00:36:25.086 --> 00:36:25.506 A:middle
sites.

00:36:25.836 --> 00:36:27.096 A:middle
So, then we can improve the web

00:36:27.096 --> 00:36:27.726 A:middle
for everyone.

00:36:29.956 --> 00:36:33.666 A:middle
Now, in summary, we are all here

00:36:33.666 --> 00:36:36.256 A:middle
today, and listening online and

00:36:36.256 --> 00:36:37.726 A:middle
here this week in an effort to

00:36:37.726 --> 00:36:39.056 A:middle
build great features for our

00:36:39.056 --> 00:36:39.506 A:middle
users.

00:36:40.596 --> 00:36:41.736 A:middle
Make something that our users

00:36:41.736 --> 00:36:42.256 A:middle
will love.

00:36:42.786 --> 00:36:43.896 A:middle
Make something that our users

00:36:43.896 --> 00:36:45.846 A:middle
think is fun, or maybe makes

00:36:45.846 --> 00:36:47.636 A:middle
their lives easier, their jobs

00:36:47.636 --> 00:36:47.986 A:middle
easier.

00:36:47.986 --> 00:36:50.826 A:middle
And what I want you to take away

00:36:50.826 --> 00:36:52.666 A:middle
from the past 40 minutes, is

00:36:52.666 --> 00:36:54.636 A:middle
several techniques and concepts

00:36:54.756 --> 00:36:56.016 A:middle
that you can apply within your

00:36:56.056 --> 00:36:56.436 A:middle
own app.

00:36:57.646 --> 00:36:59.526 A:middle
The first one is consent and

00:36:59.526 --> 00:37:00.366 A:middle
transparency.

00:36:59.526 --> 00:37:00.366 A:middle
transparency.

00:37:01.156 --> 00:37:02.816 A:middle
Make sure to think about what

00:37:02.816 --> 00:37:04.256 A:middle
you're saying in your Purpose

00:37:04.256 --> 00:37:05.456 A:middle
Strings and be clear to your

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:05.856 A:middle
users.

00:37:06.606 --> 00:37:08.816 A:middle
Also, adopt While In Use

00:37:08.816 --> 00:37:09.486 A:middle
location.

00:37:10.696 --> 00:37:12.496 A:middle
Together, we can build a healthy

00:37:12.686 --> 00:37:14.676 A:middle
app ecosystem, and DeviceCheck

00:37:14.676 --> 00:37:15.146 A:middle
is part of that.

00:37:15.936 --> 00:37:18.676 A:middle
We want to build a healthy web

00:37:19.786 --> 00:37:21.686 A:middle
for everyone, and Intelligent

00:37:21.686 --> 00:37:23.206 A:middle
Tracking Protection is a key

00:37:23.206 --> 00:37:25.276 A:middle
part of that.

00:37:25.516 --> 00:37:27.326 A:middle
With Differential Privacy, we're

00:37:27.326 --> 00:37:29.016 A:middle
building features and learning

00:37:29.016 --> 00:37:30.326 A:middle
how to build better features,

00:37:30.326 --> 00:37:31.876 A:middle
while protecting user privacy.

00:37:33.046 --> 00:37:34.356 A:middle
Now, one of the great things

00:37:34.356 --> 00:37:36.826 A:middle
about my job at Apple is I get

00:37:36.826 --> 00:37:37.856 A:middle
to work with a bunch of

00:37:37.856 --> 00:37:38.756 A:middle
different teams.

00:37:39.206 --> 00:37:40.916 A:middle
And everyone's working so hard

00:37:40.916 --> 00:37:42.976 A:middle
to build fantastic features and

00:37:42.976 --> 00:37:44.326 A:middle
APIs for you guys to take

00:37:44.326 --> 00:37:46.376 A:middle
advantage of, that will make our

00:37:46.376 --> 00:37:48.026 A:middle
users be delighted.

00:37:48.926 --> 00:37:52.706 A:middle
And that same passion, I get to

00:37:52.706 --> 00:37:54.936 A:middle
apply and work with great people

00:37:55.146 --> 00:37:56.956 A:middle
to apply to building privacy in,

00:37:56.956 --> 00:37:57.646 A:middle
from the start.

00:37:58.186 --> 00:37:59.756 A:middle
And making sure that we all are

00:37:59.756 --> 00:38:01.926 A:middle
building great features and

00:37:59.756 --> 00:38:01.926 A:middle
building great features and

00:38:02.006 --> 00:38:03.386 A:middle
respecting users' privacy.

00:38:04.256 --> 00:38:05.796 A:middle
And what I want you to take away

00:38:05.796 --> 00:38:06.596 A:middle
from this is a bit of

00:38:06.596 --> 00:38:07.416 A:middle
inspiration.

00:38:07.816 --> 00:38:09.416 A:middle
Go home, work with the teams

00:38:09.416 --> 00:38:11.566 A:middle
that you have, and go build

00:38:11.566 --> 00:38:12.566 A:middle
great features that will

00:38:12.566 --> 00:38:15.176 A:middle
surprise and delight, but with

00:38:15.176 --> 00:38:16.036 A:middle
user privacy.

please go to this link.

00:38:29.406 --> 00:38:31.026 A:middle
And we mentioned a lot of topics

00:38:31.026 --> 00:38:31.836 A:middle
during this talk.

00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:33.246 A:middle
And so, I'd encourage you to go

00:38:33.246 --> 00:38:34.546 A:middle
check out some of these related

00:38:34.546 --> 00:38:36.606 A:middle
sessions, including the CoreML

00:38:36.606 --> 00:38:38.056 A:middle
one that's later this afternoon.

00:38:39.236 --> 00:38:40.046 A:middle
Thank you, very much.

00:38:40.046 --> 00:38:41.326 A:middle
And have a great Developer

00:38:41.326 --> 00:38:41.966 A:middle
Conference.
