WEBVTT

00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:26.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:28.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:30.106 --> 00:00:31.256 A:middle
I'm Doug LeMoine.

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:33.246 A:middle
And I'm a design evangelist here

00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:33.826 A:middle
at Apple.

00:00:33.896 --> 00:00:35.436 A:middle
I'll be joined in a bit by Jake

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:35.916 A:middle
Behrens.

00:00:36.396 --> 00:00:37.896 A:middle
He and I have teamed up to work

00:00:37.896 --> 00:00:39.316 A:middle
with Apple Watch developers

00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:40.766 A:middle
around the world over the past

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.156 A:middle
year.

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:42.826 A:middle
Helping them make their Apple

00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:44.386 A:middle
Watch apps as awesome as

00:00:44.386 --> 00:00:44.976 A:middle
possible.

00:00:45.026 --> 00:00:46.576 A:middle
And we're here today to share

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:47.536 A:middle
what we've learned.

00:00:49.046 --> 00:00:51.056 A:middle
You might be here because you've

00:00:51.056 --> 00:00:52.716 A:middle
been developing for Apple Watch

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:53.916 A:middle
and you're looking for some

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:55.716 A:middle
inspiration and ways to improve

00:00:55.716 --> 00:00:56.126 A:middle
your app.

00:00:56.636 --> 00:00:58.276 A:middle
Or you might be here because

00:00:58.276 --> 00:00:59.286 A:middle
you're new to the platform.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.296 A:middle
Welcome. You saw Monday's

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:02.536 A:middle
keynote, you heard about the

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:04.026 A:middle
improvements, and now you're

00:01:04.026 --> 00:01:05.146 A:middle
ready to get started.

00:01:05.326 --> 00:01:07.316 A:middle
We've got tips, ideas and advice

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:08.826 A:middle
that will be useful to you all.

00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:12.076 A:middle
I'm going to begin by talking

00:01:12.076 --> 00:01:14.026 A:middle
about planning, where to start.

00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:15.556 A:middle
Or, if you've already got an app

00:01:15.796 --> 00:01:17.456 A:middle
where to go next with your next

00:01:17.456 --> 00:01:17.966 A:middle
release.

00:01:18.186 --> 00:01:19.756 A:middle
I'm going to show practical

00:01:19.756 --> 00:01:21.266 A:middle
methods that you can use to

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.426 A:middle
define a great Watch app.

00:01:23.926 --> 00:01:26.316 A:middle
And then Jake is going to talk

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:28.036 A:middle
about the implementation of a

00:01:28.036 --> 00:01:29.386 A:middle
app on Apple Watch.

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:32.046 A:middle
But what he's really going to

00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:33.906 A:middle
focus on is how you can learn

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:34.786 A:middle
from building.

00:01:35.346 --> 00:01:36.766 A:middle
He's going to talk about how we

00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.536 A:middle
tested ideas and learned from

00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:40.686 A:middle
the people who use our app since

00:01:40.686 --> 00:01:41.886 A:middle
the initial launch of Apple

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:42.346 A:middle
Watch.

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:44.886 A:middle
OK, let's dive in.

00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:48.076 A:middle
So, believe it or not, it was

00:01:48.076 --> 00:01:49.406 A:middle
only 2 years ago that Apple

00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:50.836 A:middle
Watch was unveiled to the world

00:01:50.956 --> 00:01:53.036 A:middle
and since then capabilities have

00:01:53.036 --> 00:01:54.546 A:middle
increased with each hardware and

00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:55.516 A:middle
software release.

00:01:55.936 --> 00:01:57.576 A:middle
In the past year alone, the

00:01:57.576 --> 00:01:58.746 A:middle
power and performance have

00:01:58.746 --> 00:01:59.266 A:middle
doubled.

00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:01.836 A:middle
And Apple Watch Series 2 extends

00:02:01.836 --> 00:02:03.116 A:middle
what you can do with the watch

00:02:03.116 --> 00:02:04.816 A:middle
with built-in GPS and water

00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:06.356 A:middle
resistance up to 50 meters.

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:08.466 A:middle
This means it Watch apps can

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.376 A:middle
track your workouts, when you go

00:02:10.376 --> 00:02:12.006 A:middle
for a bike, ride, or a swim, or

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:12.466 A:middle
a run.

00:02:12.956 --> 00:02:14.496 A:middle
And some health and fitness apps

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:16.096 A:middle
provide inspiration for the

00:02:16.096 --> 00:02:17.126 A:middle
platform as a whole.

00:02:17.126 --> 00:02:18.066 A:middle
So, I want to walk through a

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:18.916 A:middle
couple of those.

00:02:20.336 --> 00:02:22.886 A:middle
Sweat, an app from Australia can

00:02:22.886 --> 00:02:24.376 A:middle
guide you through a variety of

00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:25.556 A:middle
different exercises.

00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:28.606 A:middle
So, these are 28-minute workouts

00:02:28.676 --> 00:02:30.046 A:middle
with literally dozens of

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:30.726 A:middle
movements.

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:32.246 A:middle
And each of them has a helpful

00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:33.786 A:middle
animation on the watch.

00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:35.716 A:middle
If you're not sure how to do a

00:02:35.716 --> 00:02:37.066 A:middle
particular movement, you can get

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:38.476 A:middle
visual guidance right there.

00:02:39.886 --> 00:02:42.456 A:middle
Zepp helps you improve your

00:02:42.456 --> 00:02:44.146 A:middle
tennis swing by using a sensor

00:02:44.146 --> 00:02:45.296 A:middle
mounted on the racket.

00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:46.106 A:middle
You might've seen this in

00:02:46.106 --> 00:02:47.006 A:middle
Monday's keynote.

00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:48.556 A:middle
But it gives you immediate

00:02:48.556 --> 00:02:50.346 A:middle
feedback on your last serve in

00:02:50.346 --> 00:02:52.376 A:middle
this case so you can adjust for

00:02:52.376 --> 00:02:53.066 A:middle
the next one.

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:54.886 A:middle
So, you can make a serve, look

00:02:54.886 --> 00:02:56.326 A:middle
at your wrist, you can see how

00:02:56.326 --> 00:02:56.826 A:middle
you did.

00:02:57.266 --> 00:02:57.806 A:middle
Pretty cool.

00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:01.496 A:middle
RunGo from Vancouver can give

00:03:01.496 --> 00:03:03.516 A:middle
you turn by turn directions on a

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:04.916 A:middle
road or a trail run.

00:03:05.316 --> 00:03:06.686 A:middle
You simply load the route that

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:07.786 A:middle
you want and go.

00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:11.866 A:middle
So, this is voiceover, which is

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:13.186 A:middle
an accessibility feature.

00:03:13.186 --> 00:03:14.726 A:middle
And the audio can play through

00:03:14.726 --> 00:03:16.306 A:middle
the Watch speaker, or through

00:03:16.306 --> 00:03:17.526 A:middle
Bluetooth headphones that you

00:03:17.526 --> 00:03:18.686 A:middle
can connect directly to the

00:03:18.686 --> 00:03:19.216 A:middle
Watch.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.766 A:middle
So, what can we learn from the

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:23.676 A:middle
success of apps like these?

00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:25.926 A:middle
Like I said, in the past year,

00:03:26.276 --> 00:03:27.636 A:middle
we've traveled around the world.

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:29.546 A:middle
And we've seen successful watch

00:03:29.546 --> 00:03:31.566 A:middle
apps, we've seen that successful

00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:33.696 A:middle
watch app development begins

00:03:34.186 --> 00:03:34.686 A:middle
with planning.

00:03:35.276 --> 00:03:37.536 A:middle
Which sounds obvious I imagine.

00:03:37.836 --> 00:03:39.286 A:middle
But for Watch, the best way to

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:41.376 A:middle
begin planning is to be ruthless

00:03:41.416 --> 00:03:44.166 A:middle
and focusing and to identify a

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:45.126 A:middle
single feature.

00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:48.206 A:middle
A single job to do on Apple

00:03:48.206 --> 00:03:48.606 A:middle
Watch.

00:03:48.606 --> 00:03:50.316 A:middle
A single task to complete.

00:03:50.806 --> 00:03:52.246 A:middle
A single goal to achieve.

00:03:52.616 --> 00:03:53.836 A:middle
So, this could be an existing

00:03:53.836 --> 00:03:56.186 A:middle
feature from your iOS app, or it

00:03:56.186 --> 00:03:57.766 A:middle
could be something new that

00:03:57.766 --> 00:03:59.876 A:middle
makes sense on the wrist and

00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:01.856 A:middle
that supplements what you do on

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:02.216 A:middle
iOS.

00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:05.296 A:middle
So, this is an app called Night

00:04:05.296 --> 00:04:06.466 A:middle
Sky, from the UK.

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:08.456 A:middle
If I see something up in the

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:10.586 A:middle
sky, I can use the Night Sky app

00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:12.006 A:middle
on Apple Watch to figure out

00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:12.576 A:middle
what it is.

00:04:13.216 --> 00:04:15.236 A:middle
In this case, it actually starts

00:04:15.236 --> 00:04:17.526 A:middle
with a notification that points

00:04:17.686 --> 00:04:19.076 A:middle
my way to the International

00:04:19.076 --> 00:04:19.936 A:middle
Space Station.

00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:22.346 A:middle
So, that's what the arrow is

00:04:22.426 --> 00:04:22.766 A:middle
there.

00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:24.716 A:middle
So, a simple feature like this

00:04:24.826 --> 00:04:27.146 A:middle
can provide a small, or even big

00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:28.266 A:middle
moment of delight.

00:04:29.696 --> 00:04:32.606 A:middle
Speaking of delight, I can also

00:04:33.016 --> 00:04:35.296 A:middle
see if a new cat toy has brought

00:04:35.296 --> 00:04:36.726 A:middle
any new cats to my yard.

00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:39.916 A:middle
This is Neko Atsume from Japan.

00:04:40.476 --> 00:04:41.546 A:middle
Let's see, are there any new

00:04:41.546 --> 00:04:42.126 A:middle
cats?

00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:44.996 A:middle
Oh, yeah. Look at that little

00:04:44.996 --> 00:04:45.236 A:middle
guy.

00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:50.246 A:middle
But to be honest I'm more of a

00:04:50.246 --> 00:04:50.876 A:middle
dog person.

00:04:51.146 --> 00:04:52.836 A:middle
But this is an awesome app.

00:04:54.176 --> 00:04:55.976 A:middle
So, what do these apps do well?

00:04:56.116 --> 00:04:57.016 A:middle
They focus.

00:04:57.146 --> 00:04:58.686 A:middle
They reduce the scope of what

00:04:58.686 --> 00:05:00.696 A:middle
they try to do down to one thing

00:05:00.696 --> 00:05:02.036 A:middle
that makes sense on the wrist.

00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:04.806 A:middle
Night Sky offers a way to answer

00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:07.636 A:middle
one question, what is that?

00:05:07.636 --> 00:05:09.386 A:middle
That's it.

00:05:09.656 --> 00:05:11.706 A:middle
Night Sky's iOS app does much,

00:05:11.706 --> 00:05:12.346 A:middle
much more.

00:05:12.606 --> 00:05:13.636 A:middle
Check out all the things you can

00:05:13.636 --> 00:05:14.146 A:middle
do here.

00:05:14.286 --> 00:05:15.916 A:middle
You can find constellations.

00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:17.276 A:middle
You can learn about stars.

00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:18.796 A:middle
You can spend minutes or even

00:05:18.796 --> 00:05:20.296 A:middle
hours in here exploring.

00:05:21.736 --> 00:05:23.496 A:middle
There are no menus in the watch

00:05:23.496 --> 00:05:23.786 A:middle
app.

00:05:23.786 --> 00:05:25.106 A:middle
There's no navigation at all,

00:05:25.106 --> 00:05:25.446 A:middle
really.

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:27.526 A:middle
Other than the cosmic navigation

00:05:27.526 --> 00:05:28.946 A:middle
of course, that the app allows

00:05:28.946 --> 00:05:29.556 A:middle
you to do.

00:05:30.376 --> 00:05:32.346 A:middle
It's things like this, in my

00:05:32.346 --> 00:05:33.576 A:middle
opinion, that really show what

00:05:33.576 --> 00:05:34.726 A:middle
the platform can do.

00:05:35.176 --> 00:05:36.896 A:middle
So, once you have your feature

00:05:37.186 --> 00:05:39.496 A:middle
what do you do next?

00:05:39.586 --> 00:05:41.046 A:middle
We've got some guidelines for

00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:43.146 A:middle
extending the UI and the UX of

00:05:43.146 --> 00:05:45.056 A:middle
your app on the Watch platform.

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:50.226 A:middle
All right, so the UI's of great

00:05:50.226 --> 00:05:51.926 A:middle
Apple Watch experiences, have

00:05:52.066 --> 00:05:53.676 A:middle
three characteristics or

00:05:53.676 --> 00:05:54.466 A:middle
qualities.

00:05:54.596 --> 00:05:56.306 A:middle
First, they're legible.

00:05:57.146 --> 00:05:58.686 A:middle
Meaning the text on the screen

00:05:58.686 --> 00:06:00.226 A:middle
is readable with sufficient

00:06:00.226 --> 00:06:00.916 A:middle
contrast.

00:06:02.486 --> 00:06:03.666 A:middle
I'm saying this like it's

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:06.126 A:middle
revolutionary, but it's actually

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:07.746 A:middle
really simple and it's really

00:06:07.746 --> 00:06:08.196 A:middle
key.

00:06:08.536 --> 00:06:09.826 A:middle
That's why it comes first.

00:06:11.096 --> 00:06:13.866 A:middle
The Watch comp that you design

00:06:14.176 --> 00:06:16.156 A:middle
might look awesome on your 5K

00:06:16.296 --> 00:06:18.096 A:middle
iMac, but you need to see how it

00:06:18.096 --> 00:06:19.886 A:middle
performs on the small screen of

00:06:19.886 --> 00:06:21.036 A:middle
the device itself.

00:06:21.036 --> 00:06:21.766 A:middle
Is it legible?

00:06:22.196 --> 00:06:23.486 A:middle
Can you read it in a glance?

00:06:24.036 --> 00:06:25.016 A:middle
In bright sunlight?

00:06:25.556 --> 00:06:27.546 A:middle
Great experiences, as we all

00:06:27.546 --> 00:06:29.326 A:middle
know, start with getting the

00:06:29.326 --> 00:06:30.316 A:middle
little things right.

00:06:30.986 --> 00:06:32.536 A:middle
So, make sure that the text and

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:34.596 A:middle
graphics on your Watch face are

00:06:34.596 --> 00:06:36.046 A:middle
readable in the specific

00:06:36.176 --> 00:06:37.586 A:middle
conditions of watch use.

00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:40.596 A:middle
So, number 2, they're concise.

00:06:40.856 --> 00:06:41.556 A:middle
To the point.

00:06:42.416 --> 00:06:43.556 A:middle
Only the information that

00:06:43.556 --> 00:06:45.376 A:middle
matters, only the actions that

00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:45.826 A:middle
matter.

00:06:46.476 --> 00:06:48.216 A:middle
Watch experiences can be truly

00:06:48.216 --> 00:06:51.506 A:middle
powerful when the Watch app has

00:06:51.736 --> 00:06:53.406 A:middle
tightly defined what it's trying

00:06:53.406 --> 00:06:55.356 A:middle
to do, and then delivers it in a

00:06:55.356 --> 00:06:57.186 A:middle
form that the user can grasp in

00:06:57.186 --> 00:06:57.806 A:middle
a glance.

00:06:59.196 --> 00:07:01.366 A:middle
And finally, they're timely.

00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:03.586 A:middle
Get it?

00:07:03.586 --> 00:07:04.716 A:middle
[ Chuckles ]

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:08.476 A:middle
Oh, man, I have to wait for

00:07:08.476 --> 00:07:10.136 A:middle
groans and uncomfortable coughs

00:07:10.136 --> 00:07:10.596 A:middle
to end.

00:07:11.116 --> 00:07:13.136 A:middle
In all seriousness, timely is

00:07:13.136 --> 00:07:14.526 A:middle
actually just the most direct

00:07:14.526 --> 00:07:16.446 A:middle
way of describing the Watch

00:07:16.446 --> 00:07:18.216 A:middle
being relevant in the moment.

00:07:18.216 --> 00:07:19.956 A:middle
Both in a temporal sense and in

00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:21.126 A:middle
a situational sense.

00:07:21.196 --> 00:07:23.766 A:middle
So, we're going to use this as a

00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:25.236 A:middle
checklist as we look through

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:26.846 A:middle
some Apple Watch experiences.

00:07:27.226 --> 00:07:28.496 A:middle
And I'd encourage you to do the

00:07:28.496 --> 00:07:31.226 A:middle
same when you plan and design

00:07:31.226 --> 00:07:31.906 A:middle
your apps.

00:07:32.196 --> 00:07:33.126 A:middle
All right, let's look at an

00:07:33.126 --> 00:07:33.726 A:middle
example.

00:07:35.696 --> 00:07:36.836 A:middle
This is Lift.

00:07:37.266 --> 00:07:39.736 A:middle
It displays 3 simple elements on

00:07:39.736 --> 00:07:40.296 A:middle
the screen.

00:07:41.656 --> 00:07:43.396 A:middle
The type is big with good

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:44.336 A:middle
contrast right.

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:46.976 A:middle
Legible. The elements are

00:07:46.976 --> 00:07:49.316 A:middle
informative, action oriented and

00:07:49.366 --> 00:07:51.786 A:middle
optimized for one thing; request

00:07:51.786 --> 00:07:52.166 A:middle
lift.

00:07:53.166 --> 00:07:57.216 A:middle
Concise. Also, the relationship

00:07:57.216 --> 00:07:58.676 A:middle
between the elements is clear.

00:07:58.816 --> 00:08:00.006 A:middle
It's got my location.

00:08:00.656 --> 00:08:02.706 A:middle
There's a 1 minute waiting time.

00:08:03.506 --> 00:08:04.276 A:middle
It's timely.

00:08:04.586 --> 00:08:05.906 A:middle
And notice that Lift is keeping

00:08:05.906 --> 00:08:07.596 A:middle
the location area simple and

00:08:07.596 --> 00:08:08.236 A:middle
glanceable.

00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:09.916 A:middle
They're also doing things behind

00:08:09.916 --> 00:08:11.696 A:middle
the scenes to populate it with

00:08:11.696 --> 00:08:12.836 A:middle
things that users might

00:08:12.836 --> 00:08:13.486 A:middle
recognize.

00:08:13.616 --> 00:08:15.676 A:middle
Favorites, previous places, or

00:08:15.676 --> 00:08:16.916 A:middle
just well-known places.

00:08:18.216 --> 00:08:19.526 A:middle
Okay let's look at another

00:08:19.526 --> 00:08:20.006 A:middle
example.

00:08:20.006 --> 00:08:21.586 A:middle
This is Major League Baseball.

00:08:22.036 --> 00:08:23.676 A:middle
The team names are big, really

00:08:23.676 --> 00:08:24.046 A:middle
big.

00:08:24.506 --> 00:08:26.316 A:middle
For the most part legibility is

00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:28.126 A:middle
about size on Apple Watch.

00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:29.546 A:middle
If you wonder whether your type

00:08:29.606 --> 00:08:31.026 A:middle
is big enough, it probably

00:08:31.026 --> 00:08:31.376 A:middle
isn't.

00:08:32.606 --> 00:08:34.206 A:middle
When the primary information is

00:08:34.206 --> 00:08:36.216 A:middle
undeniably primary, you're

00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:37.376 A:middle
heading in the right direction.

00:08:39.216 --> 00:08:41.356 A:middle
The relevant details with Major

00:08:41.356 --> 00:08:43.036 A:middle
League Baseball are concise.

00:08:43.236 --> 00:08:44.506 A:middle
Today's pitchers and their

00:08:44.506 --> 00:08:45.056 A:middle
records.

00:08:45.236 --> 00:08:46.366 A:middle
And finally, it's showing me

00:08:46.416 --> 00:08:47.656 A:middle
only today's game.

00:08:48.746 --> 00:08:52.176 A:middle
Timely. All right, now I want to

00:08:52.176 --> 00:08:53.546 A:middle
talk about concise.

00:08:53.896 --> 00:08:55.146 A:middle
This is CBS News.

00:08:55.546 --> 00:08:57.076 A:middle
We're at the home view, which

00:08:57.076 --> 00:08:58.386 A:middle
shows headlines.

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:00.376 A:middle
I can simply scroll through and

00:09:00.376 --> 00:09:01.976 A:middle
get caught up in a few seconds.

00:09:02.396 --> 00:09:03.926 A:middle
How many headlines does it show?

00:09:04.316 --> 00:09:05.636 A:middle
Usually around 8 to 10.

00:09:06.086 --> 00:09:07.086 A:middle
It seems like enough.

00:09:07.326 --> 00:09:08.976 A:middle
All right, let's drill in.

00:09:09.856 --> 00:09:11.796 A:middle
So, now we're in the article

00:09:11.796 --> 00:09:12.146 A:middle
view.

00:09:12.246 --> 00:09:13.826 A:middle
And once we get here, we can

00:09:13.826 --> 00:09:15.066 A:middle
quickly scan down through the

00:09:15.066 --> 00:09:16.626 A:middle
article using the digital crown.

00:09:17.146 --> 00:09:19.446 A:middle
And pretty quickly I get to the

00:09:19.446 --> 00:09:20.146 A:middle
bottom.

00:09:20.146 --> 00:09:21.476 A:middle
So, this is actually just a

00:09:21.476 --> 00:09:22.336 A:middle
synopsis.

00:09:22.656 --> 00:09:24.016 A:middle
And I can continue reading on my

00:09:24.186 --> 00:09:24.596 A:middle
iPhone.

00:09:24.596 --> 00:09:26.586 A:middle
Either by using Handoff or by

00:09:26.586 --> 00:09:28.136 A:middle
bookmarking it and saving it for

00:09:28.136 --> 00:09:28.516 A:middle
later.

00:09:29.316 --> 00:09:30.956 A:middle
All right, let's talk about what

00:09:30.956 --> 00:09:31.846 A:middle
they did well here.

00:09:32.426 --> 00:09:33.646 A:middle
Big, bright text.

00:09:35.336 --> 00:09:37.666 A:middle
Concise. It doesn't necessarily

00:09:37.666 --> 00:09:39.096 A:middle
mean fits on one screen.

00:09:39.096 --> 00:09:41.236 A:middle
It can simply mean one thing

00:09:41.236 --> 00:09:42.556 A:middle
that a person cares about.

00:09:42.906 --> 00:09:44.236 A:middle
So, even though this experience

00:09:44.236 --> 00:09:46.106 A:middle
involves scrolling headlines and

00:09:46.106 --> 00:09:47.806 A:middle
text it feels simple.

00:09:49.076 --> 00:09:50.506 A:middle
And finally, timely.

00:09:50.576 --> 00:09:52.426 A:middle
I have access to the latest news

00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:53.976 A:middle
in a super accessible form.

00:09:55.186 --> 00:09:57.786 A:middle
Okay, now that we talked about

00:09:57.786 --> 00:10:00.076 A:middle
the UI of apps, I want to talk

00:10:00.076 --> 00:10:01.196 A:middle
about the other side of the

00:10:01.196 --> 00:10:01.976 A:middle
experience.

00:10:02.576 --> 00:10:04.566 A:middle
The person using your app.

00:10:05.186 --> 00:10:05.856 A:middle
And I'm going to get

00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:07.806 A:middle
aspirational about the kind of

00:10:07.806 --> 00:10:10.486 A:middle
experience that can be created

00:10:10.486 --> 00:10:11.486 A:middle
on Apple Watch.

00:10:12.016 --> 00:10:16.246 A:middle
On iPhone, we all know that apps

00:10:16.376 --> 00:10:18.346 A:middle
can help people get things done,

00:10:18.346 --> 00:10:19.796 A:middle
answer questions and achieve

00:10:19.796 --> 00:10:20.346 A:middle
goals.

00:10:20.756 --> 00:10:22.716 A:middle
The Watch, the goals are the

00:10:22.716 --> 00:10:24.566 A:middle
same, but the parameters of the

00:10:24.566 --> 00:10:25.756 A:middle
experience are different.

00:10:25.946 --> 00:10:27.366 A:middle
The screen is small.

00:10:27.846 --> 00:10:29.696 A:middle
So, the information needs to be

00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:31.636 A:middle
distributed in small chunks.

00:10:31.866 --> 00:10:32.716 A:middle
Just in time.

00:10:33.646 --> 00:10:35.606 A:middle
Great Watch experiences involve

00:10:35.606 --> 00:10:37.996 A:middle
apps doing work on behalf of

00:10:38.076 --> 00:10:38.526 A:middle
people.

00:10:38.936 --> 00:10:40.456 A:middle
Working in the background and

00:10:40.456 --> 00:10:42.726 A:middle
emerging at the right time to be

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:43.276 A:middle
helpful.

00:10:44.226 --> 00:10:45.766 A:middle
Sort of like an expert.

00:10:46.316 --> 00:10:48.266 A:middle
Someone who's smart about stuff

00:10:48.266 --> 00:10:50.256 A:middle
that I care about and leaps in

00:10:50.256 --> 00:10:51.786 A:middle
to offer help when necessary.

00:10:51.936 --> 00:10:54.306 A:middle
Like an engineer or a scientist,

00:10:54.506 --> 00:10:56.316 A:middle
like mission control who helps

00:10:56.316 --> 00:10:59.066 A:middle
an astronaut navigate space, who

00:10:59.856 --> 00:11:01.966 A:middle
informs the astronaut when

00:11:01.966 --> 00:11:03.846 A:middle
decisions need to be made or

00:11:03.846 --> 00:11:04.936 A:middle
when new information is

00:11:04.936 --> 00:11:05.516 A:middle
available.

00:11:05.936 --> 00:11:06.846 A:middle
Information that helps

00:11:06.846 --> 00:11:07.676 A:middle
navigation.

00:11:08.146 --> 00:11:09.586 A:middle
The status of the spacecraft,

00:11:09.816 --> 00:11:11.206 A:middle
are the pod bay doors open.

00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:13.056 A:middle
Is it time to jump to hyper

00:11:13.056 --> 00:11:13.506 A:middle
speed.

00:11:14.096 --> 00:11:17.216 A:middle
This is how engineers behind the

00:11:17.216 --> 00:11:19.416 A:middle
scenes assist astronauts.

00:11:20.226 --> 00:11:22.116 A:middle
The scientist manages the flow

00:11:22.116 --> 00:11:24.056 A:middle
of information to the astronaut

00:11:24.296 --> 00:11:25.866 A:middle
and gets her the information she

00:11:25.866 --> 00:11:28.066 A:middle
needs just in time in a concise

00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:28.936 A:middle
and timely way.

00:11:29.576 --> 00:11:33.696 A:middle
So, the good news is being

00:11:33.696 --> 00:11:36.276 A:middle
helpful in this way is not

00:11:36.276 --> 00:11:37.256 A:middle
rocket science.

00:11:38.896 --> 00:11:40.086 A:middle
Sorry, about that.

00:11:41.086 --> 00:11:41.966 A:middle
Terrible joke.

00:11:43.066 --> 00:11:45.356 A:middle
Let's take WWDC as an example.

00:11:45.976 --> 00:11:47.436 A:middle
You spent the last 3 days,

00:11:47.436 --> 00:11:49.276 A:middle
surrounded by life forms.

00:11:49.446 --> 00:11:50.686 A:middle
You may know some of them.

00:11:50.906 --> 00:11:52.296 A:middle
Some of them may know you.

00:11:52.726 --> 00:11:54.186 A:middle
You may have connections that

00:11:54.186 --> 00:11:55.546 A:middle
neither of you even knew about.

00:11:56.586 --> 00:11:57.756 A:middle
The iPhone helps.

00:11:57.906 --> 00:11:59.146 A:middle
There are various ways of

00:11:59.146 --> 00:12:00.776 A:middle
organizing your life on iPhone;

00:12:01.086 --> 00:12:03.076 A:middle
contacts apps, social networks

00:12:03.076 --> 00:12:03.776 A:middle
and so on.

00:12:03.886 --> 00:12:04.956 A:middle
All of which are useful.

00:12:05.196 --> 00:12:07.036 A:middle
Apps like these typically

00:12:07.036 --> 00:12:09.456 A:middle
provide places that help people

00:12:09.456 --> 00:12:11.986 A:middle
begin looking for information.

00:12:13.196 --> 00:12:14.436 A:middle
Sometimes you want the

00:12:14.436 --> 00:12:16.256 A:middle
information to come to you.

00:12:16.566 --> 00:12:17.696 A:middle
You want these apps to be

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:19.456 A:middle
proactive or predictive.

00:12:19.836 --> 00:12:21.316 A:middle
You want help remembering a

00:12:21.316 --> 00:12:21.846 A:middle
name.

00:12:22.486 --> 00:12:24.166 A:middle
Or help revealing a connection

00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:25.286 A:middle
or a common interest that you

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:25.926 A:middle
might have.

00:12:27.136 --> 00:12:29.576 A:middle
My point here is that the magic

00:12:29.576 --> 00:12:31.316 A:middle
and delight of Apple Watch

00:12:31.316 --> 00:12:33.606 A:middle
happens when your apps work on

00:12:33.606 --> 00:12:36.316 A:middle
behalf of your users to get them

00:12:36.316 --> 00:12:37.796 A:middle
the information they need in the

00:12:37.796 --> 00:12:38.216 A:middle
moment.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:40.556 A:middle
And by doing this and still

00:12:40.556 --> 00:12:42.086 A:middle
trust that they will continue to

00:12:42.086 --> 00:12:43.286 A:middle
do so in the future.

00:12:45.156 --> 00:12:47.476 A:middle
So, when your app is legible,

00:12:47.476 --> 00:12:50.026 A:middle
concise and timely your users

00:12:50.026 --> 00:12:51.996 A:middle
will feel a personal connection.

00:12:51.996 --> 00:12:53.266 A:middle
So, we're going to add a fourth

00:12:53.266 --> 00:12:55.356 A:middle
quality of great Apple Watch

00:12:55.356 --> 00:12:57.506 A:middle
experiences, personal.

00:12:58.256 --> 00:12:59.596 A:middle
Being legible, concise and

00:12:59.596 --> 00:13:02.066 A:middle
timely establishes that personal

00:13:02.066 --> 00:13:03.966 A:middle
connection with each individual

00:13:03.966 --> 00:13:04.996 A:middle
who uses your app.

00:13:05.526 --> 00:13:06.526 A:middle
Knowing that they'll get the

00:13:06.526 --> 00:13:08.566 A:middle
information they need when they

00:13:09.046 --> 00:13:10.006 A:middle
need it.

00:13:10.266 --> 00:13:12.006 A:middle
Like an astronaut trust people

00:13:12.006 --> 00:13:14.206 A:middle
at mission control to pass along

00:13:14.206 --> 00:13:15.636 A:middle
the right information at the

00:13:15.636 --> 00:13:17.426 A:middle
right time, so that they can

00:13:17.426 --> 00:13:18.786 A:middle
stay focused on the mission.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.046 A:middle
OK, we're going to travel back

00:13:22.046 --> 00:13:22.676 A:middle
down to earth.

00:13:23.486 --> 00:13:24.466 A:middle
We're going to look at a quick

00:13:24.466 --> 00:13:25.116 A:middle
example.

00:13:25.986 --> 00:13:28.376 A:middle
Calendar. This is mission

00:13:28.376 --> 00:13:29.406 A:middle
control, right.

00:13:29.916 --> 00:13:32.336 A:middle
it's the big canvas.

00:13:32.606 --> 00:13:34.326 A:middle
Where you can survey the future,

00:13:34.326 --> 00:13:35.696 A:middle
see what's going on for the next

00:13:35.696 --> 00:13:36.406 A:middle
week or month.

00:13:36.786 --> 00:13:38.276 A:middle
Here you've got all the dials

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:38.856 A:middle
and levers.

00:13:38.976 --> 00:13:41.616 A:middle
You can create calendars, create

00:13:41.616 --> 00:13:43.386 A:middle
meetings, move stuff around,

00:13:43.476 --> 00:13:45.096 A:middle
tons of real estate, and tons of

00:13:45.096 --> 00:13:45.726 A:middle
tools.

00:13:46.956 --> 00:13:48.206 A:middle
As you move on the iPhone, the

00:13:48.206 --> 00:13:49.056 A:middle
view narrows.

00:13:49.056 --> 00:13:49.956 A:middle
It's just today.

00:13:50.386 --> 00:13:52.016 A:middle
Why? Well because this

00:13:52.016 --> 00:13:54.056 A:middle
accurately reflects the scope of

00:13:54.056 --> 00:13:55.446 A:middle
what you typically care about on

00:13:55.446 --> 00:13:56.286 A:middle
a mobile device.

00:13:56.366 --> 00:13:57.556 A:middle
You can still navigate through

00:13:57.556 --> 00:13:58.586 A:middle
weeks and months, but you're

00:13:58.586 --> 00:13:59.996 A:middle
focused on the near future.

00:14:00.966 --> 00:14:02.316 A:middle
Zooming in further, to the

00:14:02.316 --> 00:14:02.766 A:middle
wrist.

00:14:03.356 --> 00:14:04.716 A:middle
Apple Watch shows you the next

00:14:04.716 --> 00:14:05.106 A:middle
event.

00:14:05.826 --> 00:14:07.006 A:middle
You can scroll through events

00:14:07.006 --> 00:14:08.606 A:middle
over the day and into subsequent

00:14:08.606 --> 00:14:08.986 A:middle
days.

00:14:09.036 --> 00:14:11.046 A:middle
It's optimized for the next

00:14:12.516 --> 00:14:12.616 A:middle
thing.

00:14:12.816 --> 00:14:13.836 A:middle
Finally, the calendar

00:14:13.836 --> 00:14:14.756 A:middle
complication.

00:14:15.416 --> 00:14:16.726 A:middle
So, I can keep track of where I

00:14:16.726 --> 00:14:18.476 A:middle
need to be by simply glancing at

00:14:18.476 --> 00:14:19.816 A:middle
my wrist and seeing it right

00:14:19.816 --> 00:14:20.926 A:middle
there in the middle of my watch

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:21.346 A:middle
face.

00:14:21.346 --> 00:14:22.316 A:middle
So, we've gone from mission

00:14:22.316 --> 00:14:24.186 A:middle
control to the mission.

00:14:25.426 --> 00:14:25.836 A:middle
All right.

00:14:26.196 --> 00:14:27.176 A:middle
So, I've shown some different

00:14:27.176 --> 00:14:28.756 A:middle
components of Apple Watch, now

00:14:28.756 --> 00:14:30.356 A:middle
let's walk through each one

00:14:30.586 --> 00:14:31.016 A:middle
quickly.

00:14:31.466 --> 00:14:34.216 A:middle
Each of these can be used to

00:14:34.526 --> 00:14:35.856 A:middle
deliver information to your

00:14:35.856 --> 00:14:37.236 A:middle
users on Apple Watch.

00:14:38.006 --> 00:14:39.526 A:middle
The three components of every

00:14:39.526 --> 00:14:40.666 A:middle
Watch experience.

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:41.806 A:middle
And like they're shown here,

00:14:41.806 --> 00:14:43.036 A:middle
they're equally important.

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:45.876 A:middle
Unlike other platforms, the app

00:14:45.876 --> 00:14:47.986 A:middle
is not necessarily the center of

00:14:47.986 --> 00:14:49.586 A:middle
an experience on Apple Watch.

00:14:50.426 --> 00:14:51.916 A:middle
There are complications which

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:53.876 A:middle
are persistently displayed on

00:14:53.876 --> 00:14:54.716 A:middle
the Watch face.

00:14:55.096 --> 00:14:56.516 A:middle
They're a way for you to provide

00:14:56.516 --> 00:14:58.326 A:middle
ambient information or access to

00:14:58.326 --> 00:14:58.866 A:middle
your app.

00:15:00.106 --> 00:15:01.266 A:middle
Notifications, which you're

00:15:01.396 --> 00:15:02.716 A:middle
probably already using on iOS,

00:15:02.716 --> 00:15:04.016 A:middle
and we'll talk about what's

00:15:04.016 --> 00:15:05.376 A:middle
different on Apple Watch.

00:15:06.666 --> 00:15:08.306 A:middle
And finally, the app itself.

00:15:08.486 --> 00:15:10.576 A:middle
Important of course, but not

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.386 A:middle
necessarily more so than others.

00:15:12.846 --> 00:15:13.786 A:middle
So, let's start with the most

00:15:13.786 --> 00:15:14.976 A:middle
persistent element of the

00:15:14.976 --> 00:15:15.746 A:middle
experience.

00:15:15.746 --> 00:15:16.746 A:middle
The complication.

00:15:17.086 --> 00:15:19.116 A:middle
Information from your app on the

00:15:19.116 --> 00:15:19.966 A:middle
Watch face.

00:15:21.116 --> 00:15:23.166 A:middle
Complications are helpful when

00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:24.876 A:middle
they're continuously providing

00:15:24.876 --> 00:15:26.926 A:middle
value to users.

00:15:27.576 --> 00:15:30.246 A:middle
So, what persistently provides

00:15:30.626 --> 00:15:31.176 A:middle
value?

00:15:32.086 --> 00:15:33.326 A:middle
Well, being relevant.

00:15:34.526 --> 00:15:36.036 A:middle
Being predictive, offering a

00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:37.186 A:middle
peek into the future.

00:15:38.466 --> 00:15:39.666 A:middle
Showing progress.

00:15:40.776 --> 00:15:42.416 A:middle
Or, simply providing a launch

00:15:42.456 --> 00:15:44.026 A:middle
button for your app.

00:15:45.196 --> 00:15:47.146 A:middle
There are examples of each of

00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:48.696 A:middle
these on the Watch face.

00:15:49.916 --> 00:15:52.006 A:middle
CARROT weather is immediately

00:15:52.006 --> 00:15:53.636 A:middle
relevant to both here and now.

00:15:53.636 --> 00:15:55.076 A:middle
It shows me the temperature and

00:15:55.116 --> 00:15:56.776 A:middle
current atmospheric conditions.

00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:59.646 A:middle
Night Sky shows me that Neptune

00:15:59.646 --> 00:16:00.186 A:middle
is setting.

00:16:00.636 --> 00:16:01.966 A:middle
This is an upcoming thing that I

00:16:01.966 --> 00:16:02.566 A:middle
care about.

00:16:02.566 --> 00:16:03.966 A:middle
And then there's the calendar

00:16:03.966 --> 00:16:05.596 A:middle
complication, letting me know

00:16:05.596 --> 00:16:07.846 A:middle
what I've got coming up.

00:16:08.076 --> 00:16:09.866 A:middle
Finally, Nike Run Club shows me

00:16:09.866 --> 00:16:10.856 A:middle
the miles I've logged.

00:16:11.076 --> 00:16:12.306 A:middle
Incremental progress.

00:16:13.486 --> 00:16:14.976 A:middle
Now, as you saw on Monday, the

00:16:14.976 --> 00:16:17.396 A:middle
Siri face on watchOS4 brings

00:16:17.396 --> 00:16:18.976 A:middle
timely information to you from a

00:16:18.976 --> 00:16:20.116 A:middle
variety of places.

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:22.566 A:middle
So, this face adapts, delivering

00:16:22.566 --> 00:16:24.846 A:middle
timely, concise information

00:16:24.846 --> 00:16:26.586 A:middle
rather than requiring people to

00:16:26.586 --> 00:16:28.256 A:middle
go and find it.

00:16:28.466 --> 00:16:30.386 A:middle
OK, so those are complications.

00:16:31.016 --> 00:16:32.686 A:middle
Let's talk about notifications.

00:16:33.506 --> 00:16:35.636 A:middle
On Apple Watch, notifications

00:16:35.636 --> 00:16:37.086 A:middle
briefly take over the UI

00:16:37.656 --> 00:16:39.576 A:middle
allowing people to fully engage

00:16:39.576 --> 00:16:40.026 A:middle
with them.

00:16:40.696 --> 00:16:42.276 A:middle
This means that from the point

00:16:42.276 --> 00:16:43.946 A:middle
of view of the person using your

00:16:43.946 --> 00:16:45.996 A:middle
app a notification from your app

00:16:46.206 --> 00:16:48.866 A:middle
is essentially your app.

00:16:50.596 --> 00:16:52.616 A:middle
This notification can be styled

00:16:52.616 --> 00:16:54.716 A:middle
to look like you're app and it

00:16:54.716 --> 00:16:55.956 A:middle
can deliver information and

00:16:55.956 --> 00:16:57.386 A:middle
provide timey actions.

00:16:58.316 --> 00:16:59.596 A:middle
So, let's look at an example.

00:17:01.116 --> 00:17:02.736 A:middle
Organizing a soccer game can be

00:17:02.736 --> 00:17:03.486 A:middle
complicated.

00:17:04.416 --> 00:17:05.666 A:middle
You've got to find a field.

00:17:05.666 --> 00:17:06.876 A:middle
It takes that a big open space

00:17:06.876 --> 00:17:07.816 A:middle
to play soccer.

00:17:08.246 --> 00:17:09.216 A:middle
You've got to find a time to

00:17:09.216 --> 00:17:11.206 A:middle
play, coordinating schedules can

00:17:11.206 --> 00:17:12.206 A:middle
be complicated.

00:17:12.206 --> 00:17:14.166 A:middle
You've got to find players.

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:15.696 A:middle
If you want the game to be fun,

00:17:15.696 --> 00:17:16.576 A:middle
the players need to be of

00:17:16.576 --> 00:17:18.156 A:middle
roughly the same skill level.

00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:21.166 A:middle
And finally, you need to collect

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:23.306 A:middle
fees, sometimes for the field or

00:17:23.306 --> 00:17:23.946 A:middle
facility.

00:17:24.516 --> 00:17:26.726 A:middle
So, this is an app called

00:17:26.726 --> 00:17:27.566 A:middle
Apitador.

00:17:27.986 --> 00:17:28.816 A:middle
It's from Brazil.

00:17:29.086 --> 00:17:31.106 A:middle
It answers the question where

00:17:31.106 --> 00:17:32.876 A:middle
and when can I play a pickup

00:17:32.876 --> 00:17:33.546 A:middle
soccer game.

00:17:34.106 --> 00:17:34.896 A:middle
So, it shows me a map.

00:17:36.196 --> 00:17:37.386 A:middle
Let's say I'm at the Apple

00:17:37.386 --> 00:17:38.576 A:middle
office in São Paulo.

00:17:38.796 --> 00:17:40.296 A:middle
There tons of games going on

00:17:40.296 --> 00:17:40.796 A:middle
around me.

00:17:41.876 --> 00:17:43.246 A:middle
So, I can create a profile for

00:17:43.246 --> 00:17:45.196 A:middle
myself in iOS, including the way

00:17:45.196 --> 00:17:46.046 A:middle
that I like to play.

00:17:46.806 --> 00:17:48.116 A:middle
So, let's be honest, I have no

00:17:48.116 --> 00:17:49.676 A:middle
place in a pickup soccer game in

00:17:49.676 --> 00:17:50.136 A:middle
Brazil.

00:17:50.466 --> 00:17:51.696 A:middle
But let's go ahead and create a

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:52.536 A:middle
profile anyway.

00:17:53.006 --> 00:17:54.556 A:middle
As I start playing games, other

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:55.606 A:middle
players can rate me.

00:17:55.756 --> 00:17:56.826 A:middle
Am I a good player?

00:17:57.126 --> 00:17:58.406 A:middle
Did I show up on time?

00:17:58.816 --> 00:17:59.596 A:middle
Was I friendly?

00:18:00.906 --> 00:18:02.486 A:middle
People who are organizing games,

00:18:02.566 --> 00:18:04.006 A:middle
can see that and they can invite

00:18:04.006 --> 00:18:05.706 A:middle
me when they need a player like

00:18:06.466 --> 00:18:07.056 A:middle
me.

00:18:07.486 --> 00:18:10.516 A:middle
A "attacking midfielder" which

00:18:10.516 --> 00:18:11.816 A:middle
is I guess what I am.

00:18:12.186 --> 00:18:13.566 A:middle
So, when someone invites me to a

00:18:13.566 --> 00:18:15.846 A:middle
game, I can see this invitation

00:18:16.216 --> 00:18:17.836 A:middle
appear as a notification.

00:18:18.096 --> 00:18:19.456 A:middle
In this case, a person who is

00:18:19.456 --> 00:18:20.906 A:middle
organizing a game has reached

00:18:20.906 --> 00:18:21.446 A:middle
out to me.

00:18:21.816 --> 00:18:23.766 A:middle
There's a game on Friday at 7pm.

00:18:24.206 --> 00:18:25.276 A:middle
So, I can swipe down in the

00:18:25.276 --> 00:18:27.466 A:middle
notification and see a quick map

00:18:27.466 --> 00:18:29.006 A:middle
of where the game is, not far

00:18:29.006 --> 00:18:29.826 A:middle
from the office.

00:18:31.106 --> 00:18:33.186 A:middle
And super helpful actions that I

00:18:33.186 --> 00:18:33.666 A:middle
can tap.

00:18:34.286 --> 00:18:36.266 A:middle
So, I can say, I'm in, or out,

00:18:36.456 --> 00:18:38.286 A:middle
or dismiss it.

00:18:38.936 --> 00:18:40.896 A:middle
So, let's quickly evaluate this.

00:18:41.836 --> 00:18:44.066 A:middle
Super readable, uses their brand

00:18:44.066 --> 00:18:45.546 A:middle
shade of green really well.

00:18:46.446 --> 00:18:47.816 A:middle
That's soccer green.

00:18:49.246 --> 00:18:50.156 A:middle
Very legible.

00:18:51.926 --> 00:18:53.746 A:middle
Super concise as well, all the

00:18:53.746 --> 00:18:55.336 A:middle
information is there in a swipe.

00:18:57.056 --> 00:18:58.776 A:middle
This is pickup soccer, which can

00:18:58.776 --> 00:18:59.956 A:middle
be pretty spontaneous.

00:18:59.956 --> 00:19:02.156 A:middle
So, getting a notification about

00:19:02.156 --> 00:19:03.786 A:middle
a game that might happen soon is

00:19:03.786 --> 00:19:04.796 A:middle
also really helpful.

00:19:05.146 --> 00:19:06.196 A:middle
The fact that I can take

00:19:06.196 --> 00:19:08.166 A:middle
appropriate action directly from

00:19:08.166 --> 00:19:10.456 A:middle
the notification is pretty cool.

00:19:13.936 --> 00:19:15.656 A:middle
And receiving simple,

00:19:15.786 --> 00:19:17.536 A:middle
informative notifications from

00:19:17.536 --> 00:19:19.306 A:middle
an app that I trust about

00:19:19.306 --> 00:19:21.026 A:middle
something that I love doing

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.076 A:middle
makes me feel pretty great.

00:19:23.076 --> 00:19:24.946 A:middle
It's pretty amazing to be able

00:19:24.946 --> 00:19:26.536 A:middle
to act immediately without

00:19:26.536 --> 00:19:28.216 A:middle
reaching into my pocket and

00:19:28.216 --> 00:19:30.326 A:middle
pulling out my phone to respond.

00:19:31.176 --> 00:19:32.796 A:middle
Pretty personal.

00:19:35.176 --> 00:19:36.856 A:middle
So, what I've really liked about

00:19:36.856 --> 00:19:38.316 A:middle
this is that they extended their

00:19:38.316 --> 00:19:40.896 A:middle
app to the wrist in a helpful

00:19:40.896 --> 00:19:42.836 A:middle
delightful way that made sense

00:19:43.076 --> 00:19:44.576 A:middle
for what they do, organize

00:19:44.576 --> 00:19:45.366 A:middle
soccer games.

00:19:47.306 --> 00:19:51.886 A:middle
I'm much more likely to continue

00:19:51.886 --> 00:19:53.896 A:middle
to engage with apps like this

00:19:53.996 --> 00:19:55.086 A:middle
when they reach out to me with

00:19:55.086 --> 00:19:56.846 A:middle
valuable information and give me

00:19:56.846 --> 00:19:58.626 A:middle
easy ways to take action or make

00:19:58.626 --> 00:19:59.366 A:middle
decisions.

00:20:00.326 --> 00:20:02.106 A:middle
Okay, that's notifications.

00:20:02.516 --> 00:20:04.266 A:middle
Let's talk about apps.

00:20:04.266 --> 00:20:05.536 A:middle
So, the app as I said, isn't

00:20:05.536 --> 00:20:06.786 A:middle
necessarily the center of the

00:20:06.786 --> 00:20:08.656 A:middle
experience on Apple Watch, but

00:20:08.656 --> 00:20:09.856 A:middle
obviously, it's important to

00:20:09.856 --> 00:20:11.756 A:middle
consider what kind of experience

00:20:11.756 --> 00:20:13.366 A:middle
you can provide in it.

00:20:14.166 --> 00:20:15.906 A:middle
Notifications and complications

00:20:15.906 --> 00:20:17.456 A:middle
can feel proactive and

00:20:17.456 --> 00:20:18.146 A:middle
predictive.

00:20:18.456 --> 00:20:20.016 A:middle
Apps on the other hand are best

00:20:20.016 --> 00:20:21.316 A:middle
when they provide simple and

00:20:21.316 --> 00:20:23.656 A:middle
direct actions, or tools, or

00:20:23.656 --> 00:20:24.436 A:middle
information.

00:20:25.296 --> 00:20:27.076 A:middle
This is an app called Elk, it's

00:20:27.076 --> 00:20:27.816 A:middle
from Singapore.

00:20:28.466 --> 00:20:29.866 A:middle
It's a currency converter that

00:20:30.136 --> 00:20:31.706 A:middle
uses simple gestures in the

00:20:31.706 --> 00:20:33.406 A:middle
digital crown to quickly figure

00:20:33.406 --> 00:20:35.086 A:middle
out how expensive a thing is.

00:20:35.546 --> 00:20:37.446 A:middle
So, to be clear, the question

00:20:37.446 --> 00:20:39.286 A:middle
they're answering this how much

00:20:39.286 --> 00:20:40.016 A:middle
is this thing.

00:20:40.556 --> 00:20:43.346 A:middle
So, in this case, I'm in Canada,

00:20:44.296 --> 00:20:46.636 A:middle
I'm buying something, maple

00:20:46.636 --> 00:20:47.046 A:middle
syrup.

00:20:47.906 --> 00:20:51.796 A:middle
With a couple of swipes, there

00:20:51.796 --> 00:20:53.666 A:middle
we go, we can swipe out some

00:20:53.666 --> 00:20:55.766 A:middle
decimal places and a couple of

00:20:55.766 --> 00:20:56.796 A:middle
digital crowns.

00:20:56.996 --> 00:20:58.146 A:middle
I can have increment it.

00:20:59.056 --> 00:21:00.886 A:middle
All right, one last tweak.

00:21:01.536 --> 00:21:04.126 A:middle
Is that right?

00:21:04.126 --> 00:21:06.636 A:middle
It seems kind of expensive for

00:21:06.636 --> 00:21:07.456 A:middle
maple syrup.

00:21:08.256 --> 00:21:09.776 A:middle
So, what did they do well?

00:21:10.456 --> 00:21:11.356 A:middle
Well, they've allowed me to

00:21:11.356 --> 00:21:13.096 A:middle
quickly calculate a price, and

00:21:13.096 --> 00:21:14.796 A:middle
they've also kept it discrete,

00:21:15.096 --> 00:21:17.556 A:middle
it saves me the embarrassment of

00:21:17.686 --> 00:21:19.066 A:middle
not knowing that this is how

00:21:19.066 --> 00:21:19.906 A:middle
much it costs.

00:21:19.986 --> 00:21:21.656 A:middle
It's very simple to do this with

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:23.286 A:middle
a couple of gestures, and

00:21:23.286 --> 00:21:24.196 A:middle
they've also saved me some

00:21:24.196 --> 00:21:24.536 A:middle
money.

00:21:25.916 --> 00:21:26.646 A:middle
All right.

00:21:26.646 --> 00:21:27.606 A:middle
Let's evaluate it.

00:21:28.306 --> 00:21:30.016 A:middle
Big type, legible.

00:21:31.316 --> 00:21:33.676 A:middle
All on one screen, concise.

00:21:34.256 --> 00:21:37.496 A:middle
Helpful and discrete, timely.

00:21:38.466 --> 00:21:40.236 A:middle
Totally trustworthy and helps me

00:21:40.236 --> 00:21:42.016 A:middle
solve a real-world problem.

00:21:43.416 --> 00:21:46.546 A:middle
Awesome. OK before I turn it

00:21:46.546 --> 00:21:48.266 A:middle
over to Jake, I'm going to take

00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:50.226 A:middle
you through a quick app planning

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:52.266 A:middle
exercise where we will put to

00:21:52.266 --> 00:21:53.936 A:middle
use the things that we just saw.

00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:55.496 A:middle
So, we're going to plan an app,

00:21:56.416 --> 00:21:58.006 A:middle
from start to finish in just a

00:21:58.006 --> 00:21:58.896 A:middle
couple of minutes.

00:22:00.446 --> 00:22:03.016 A:middle
Let's say Jake and I work for a

00:22:03.016 --> 00:22:05.076 A:middle
company called SailBoss.

00:22:06.546 --> 00:22:08.056 A:middle
Now, that Apple Watch Series 2

00:22:08.056 --> 00:22:09.696 A:middle
is water resistant with onboard

00:22:09.696 --> 00:22:12.056 A:middle
GPS, it seems like it's time to

00:22:12.056 --> 00:22:14.056 A:middle
bring our iOS app to Apple

00:22:14.056 --> 00:22:14.606 A:middle
Watch.

00:22:15.456 --> 00:22:17.256 A:middle
So, I open up Sketch and I grab

00:22:17.256 --> 00:22:17.936 A:middle
an art board.

00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:19.476 A:middle
Start thinking about what we

00:22:19.476 --> 00:22:20.296 A:middle
could bring over.

00:22:20.836 --> 00:22:22.286 A:middle
We worked on some cool graphs

00:22:22.286 --> 00:22:24.036 A:middle
and visualizations for the iOS

00:22:24.036 --> 00:22:24.316 A:middle
app.

00:22:25.276 --> 00:22:27.256 A:middle
It would really be a shame to

00:22:27.256 --> 00:22:28.956 A:middle
not bring them over to Watch.

00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:31.566 A:middle
This one shows wind with an

00:22:31.566 --> 00:22:32.646 A:middle
animated arrow.

00:22:32.806 --> 00:22:33.846 A:middle
It's pretty cool, right?

00:22:34.956 --> 00:22:36.356 A:middle
And this one shows swell.

00:22:36.536 --> 00:22:37.806 A:middle
This helps people understand

00:22:37.806 --> 00:22:38.926 A:middle
whether the conditions on the

00:22:38.926 --> 00:22:40.296 A:middle
water will be in their comfort

00:22:40.296 --> 00:22:40.696 A:middle
zone.

00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:43.356 A:middle
Finally, there's the temperature

00:22:43.356 --> 00:22:44.276 A:middle
of the air and water.

00:22:45.136 --> 00:22:46.196 A:middle
Obviously, there are plenty of

00:22:46.196 --> 00:22:47.926 A:middle
other metrics that determine

00:22:47.926 --> 00:22:49.756 A:middle
good sailing conditions; tides,

00:22:49.756 --> 00:22:51.756 A:middle
and seasons, and whether Neptune

00:22:51.756 --> 00:22:53.676 A:middle
is rising and setting, and so

00:22:53.676 --> 00:22:53.916 A:middle
on.

00:22:54.156 --> 00:22:55.946 A:middle
But at SailBoss we focused on

00:22:55.946 --> 00:22:56.396 A:middle
these.

00:22:56.796 --> 00:22:57.246 A:middle
All right.

00:22:57.246 --> 00:22:58.396 A:middle
So, now we want to take these

00:22:58.396 --> 00:23:00.826 A:middle
graphs into a Watch UI.

00:23:01.066 --> 00:23:02.386 A:middle
So, back to Sketch.

00:23:02.576 --> 00:23:03.886 A:middle
Let's see if we can represent

00:23:03.926 --> 00:23:05.516 A:middle
all the metrics that matter to

00:23:05.516 --> 00:23:06.346 A:middle
our users.

00:23:07.036 --> 00:23:08.236 A:middle
All right I need to adapt the

00:23:08.236 --> 00:23:09.846 A:middle
wind graphic a little bit to fit

00:23:09.846 --> 00:23:10.286 A:middle
it in.

00:23:10.746 --> 00:23:11.876 A:middle
So, I've strung it across the

00:23:11.876 --> 00:23:13.076 A:middle
top, because it's the most

00:23:13.076 --> 00:23:13.666 A:middle
important.

00:23:14.696 --> 00:23:15.936 A:middle
And here's the swell.

00:23:17.136 --> 00:23:18.376 A:middle
Wow, that's pretty small.

00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:20.526 A:middle
Then we'll put the air

00:23:20.526 --> 00:23:22.056 A:middle
temperature down at the bottom.

00:23:22.466 --> 00:23:23.586 A:middle
Can't really fit in the water

00:23:23.586 --> 00:23:24.196 A:middle
temperature.

00:23:25.656 --> 00:23:26.916 A:middle
Let's see how we did.

00:23:28.156 --> 00:23:31.466 A:middle
So, it's like an iOS app but

00:23:31.466 --> 00:23:32.496 A:middle
miniaturized.

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:34.786 A:middle
All right.

00:23:35.646 --> 00:23:36.876 A:middle
I'm going to evaluate this

00:23:36.876 --> 00:23:38.256 A:middle
against the four qualities.

00:23:38.486 --> 00:23:40.016 A:middle
First of all, is it readable?

00:23:40.776 --> 00:23:42.626 A:middle
I guess it's actually possible

00:23:42.626 --> 00:23:43.976 A:middle
that it is readable in this room

00:23:43.976 --> 00:23:45.116 A:middle
on this massive screen.

00:23:45.596 --> 00:23:47.806 A:middle
But on the wrist, no way.

00:23:48.416 --> 00:23:49.316 A:middle
Not readable.

00:23:49.316 --> 00:23:51.166 A:middle
We tried. It's just not readable

00:23:51.166 --> 00:23:51.786 A:middle
on Watch.

00:23:52.536 --> 00:23:54.046 A:middle
Is it direct in answering the

00:23:54.046 --> 00:23:55.876 A:middle
question should I go sailing

00:23:55.876 --> 00:23:56.306 A:middle
today?

00:23:56.726 --> 00:23:58.736 A:middle
Graphs are nice and there's lots

00:23:58.736 --> 00:24:00.456 A:middle
of information, but there's no

00:24:00.456 --> 00:24:02.006 A:middle
way to glance at this and answer

00:24:02.006 --> 00:24:02.746 A:middle
the question.

00:24:03.146 --> 00:24:05.846 A:middle
So, no. Is it timely?

00:24:06.416 --> 00:24:07.826 A:middle
I mean technically, I have the

00:24:07.826 --> 00:24:09.546 A:middle
times listed across the top,

00:24:09.976 --> 00:24:10.836 A:middle
that doesn't count.

00:24:11.096 --> 00:24:12.756 A:middle
It doesn't make the information

00:24:12.756 --> 00:24:13.956 A:middle
itself timely.

00:24:14.506 --> 00:24:16.956 A:middle
And finally, personal.

00:24:17.726 --> 00:24:19.686 A:middle
In our little scenario, Jake and

00:24:19.686 --> 00:24:21.606 A:middle
I know a lot of information

00:24:21.606 --> 00:24:24.446 A:middle
about the users who use our app.

00:24:25.106 --> 00:24:26.406 A:middle
We know what their preferences

00:24:26.406 --> 00:24:27.356 A:middle
are for their sailing

00:24:27.356 --> 00:24:29.016 A:middle
conditions, but the UI is not

00:24:29.016 --> 00:24:30.656 A:middle
really making this clear at all.

00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:34.586 A:middle
Ok, back to the drawing board.

00:24:35.206 --> 00:24:36.946 A:middle
We could just allow a chart or

00:24:36.946 --> 00:24:38.696 A:middle
graph to take over the entire

00:24:38.696 --> 00:24:39.356 A:middle
screen.

00:24:40.106 --> 00:24:41.876 A:middle
The wind seems like the primary

00:24:41.876 --> 00:24:42.236 A:middle
thing.

00:24:42.236 --> 00:24:43.366 A:middle
So, let's start there.

00:24:43.416 --> 00:24:46.046 A:middle
We can even add the title up in

00:24:46.046 --> 00:24:48.176 A:middle
the status bar, that would help

00:24:48.176 --> 00:24:49.466 A:middle
with overall clarity.

00:24:49.776 --> 00:24:51.016 A:middle
Okay, let's test this out on a

00:24:51.016 --> 00:24:51.776 A:middle
Watch screen.

00:24:52.556 --> 00:24:53.836 A:middle
Definitely more legible.

00:24:54.256 --> 00:24:55.306 A:middle
Also, concise.

00:24:55.546 --> 00:24:56.706 A:middle
Seems like it could be pretty

00:24:56.706 --> 00:24:58.016 A:middle
helpful to have on the wrist.

00:24:58.326 --> 00:24:59.496 A:middle
You launch the app and see the

00:24:59.496 --> 00:25:00.736 A:middle
current wind conditions.

00:25:01.966 --> 00:25:03.746 A:middle
Actually, this gives me an idea.

00:25:04.526 --> 00:25:06.116 A:middle
This could be helpful on the

00:25:06.286 --> 00:25:07.616 A:middle
face of the Watch.

00:25:07.716 --> 00:25:10.096 A:middle
A sailing complication.

00:25:10.146 --> 00:25:11.746 A:middle
It'd be a nice way to glance at

00:25:11.746 --> 00:25:13.716 A:middle
the current wind conditions.

00:25:14.196 --> 00:25:15.056 A:middle
So, it's relevant.

00:25:15.586 --> 00:25:16.916 A:middle
It's information about the here

00:25:16.916 --> 00:25:17.316 A:middle
and now.

00:25:17.956 --> 00:25:19.546 A:middle
Persistent information that's

00:25:19.546 --> 00:25:20.136 A:middle
useful.

00:25:20.896 --> 00:25:21.936 A:middle
Now we're getting somewhere.

00:25:22.706 --> 00:25:24.796 A:middle
Now, not all apps have something

00:25:24.796 --> 00:25:26.556 A:middle
like this, but I think this one

00:25:26.556 --> 00:25:26.986 A:middle
does.

00:25:27.486 --> 00:25:28.616 A:middle
All right let's go back into the

00:25:28.616 --> 00:25:28.926 A:middle
app.

00:25:29.716 --> 00:25:32.186 A:middle
We could include other graphs as

00:25:32.186 --> 00:25:34.936 A:middle
additional pages, we can put

00:25:34.936 --> 00:25:36.136 A:middle
some page dots in there.

00:25:36.136 --> 00:25:37.916 A:middle
And then bring the other graphs

00:25:38.066 --> 00:25:38.226 A:middle
in.

00:25:38.756 --> 00:25:40.596 A:middle
With watchOS4, you can even

00:25:40.596 --> 00:25:42.236 A:middle
launch the app on the second

00:25:42.236 --> 00:25:44.526 A:middle
page, put the wind there and

00:25:44.526 --> 00:25:46.126 A:middle
that would mean temperature and

00:25:46.126 --> 00:25:48.266 A:middle
swell are both just one page

00:25:48.266 --> 00:25:49.536 A:middle
away from the most important

00:25:49.536 --> 00:25:50.266 A:middle
information.

00:25:50.266 --> 00:25:51.556 A:middle
I'll have to ask Jake about that

00:25:51.556 --> 00:25:52.996 A:middle
one, but I kind of like that

00:25:52.996 --> 00:25:53.396 A:middle
idea.

00:25:55.616 --> 00:25:57.406 A:middle
Still, it's complete, but it's

00:25:57.406 --> 00:25:58.486 A:middle
not concise.

00:25:58.546 --> 00:26:00.016 A:middle
It would take much longer than a

00:26:00.016 --> 00:26:01.856 A:middle
glance to see whether conditions

00:26:01.856 --> 00:26:02.676 A:middle
were favorable.

00:26:02.896 --> 00:26:03.936 A:middle
And you'd have to be swiping

00:26:03.936 --> 00:26:05.926 A:middle
back and forth, and tracking the

00:26:05.926 --> 00:26:06.526 A:middle
time.

00:26:06.966 --> 00:26:08.666 A:middle
We could highlight the type

00:26:08.666 --> 00:26:09.796 A:middle
range when conditions are

00:26:09.796 --> 00:26:10.886 A:middle
favorable, right?

00:26:12.356 --> 00:26:13.966 A:middle
So, let's imagine that this is a

00:26:13.966 --> 00:26:16.996 A:middle
user's preferences announced as

00:26:16.996 --> 00:26:18.766 A:middle
a primary visual element in the

00:26:18.766 --> 00:26:19.366 A:middle
graphs.

00:26:20.226 --> 00:26:21.176 A:middle
It seems like it's getting

00:26:21.176 --> 00:26:23.146 A:middle
closer to being personal, but

00:26:23.146 --> 00:26:24.156 A:middle
it's still not great.

00:26:24.496 --> 00:26:25.506 A:middle
You still have to do too much

00:26:25.506 --> 00:26:26.806 A:middle
swiping back and forth and

00:26:26.806 --> 00:26:27.966 A:middle
figuring out whether those

00:26:28.376 --> 00:26:30.546 A:middle
highlighted areas are going to

00:26:30.546 --> 00:26:31.746 A:middle
match up.

00:26:32.756 --> 00:26:34.236 A:middle
So, let's think about another

00:26:34.236 --> 00:26:35.976 A:middle
element of the Watch platform,

00:26:35.976 --> 00:26:36.986 A:middle
notifications.

00:26:36.986 --> 00:26:37.936 A:middle
I think they could actually be

00:26:37.936 --> 00:26:38.986 A:middle
pretty helpful here.

00:26:39.376 --> 00:26:41.596 A:middle
I think we could actually create

00:26:41.596 --> 00:26:43.116 A:middle
a pretty awesome experience with

00:26:43.116 --> 00:26:44.846 A:middle
these given that we know about

00:26:44.846 --> 00:26:45.976 A:middle
the conditions that people

00:26:45.976 --> 00:26:46.566 A:middle
prefer.

00:26:47.206 --> 00:26:49.186 A:middle
We could fire off a notification

00:26:49.456 --> 00:26:51.436 A:middle
when the wind, and temperature

00:26:51.436 --> 00:26:53.346 A:middle
and swell all got into the

00:26:53.346 --> 00:26:55.516 A:middle
comfort zone of a person using

00:26:55.516 --> 00:26:55.916 A:middle
our app.

00:26:56.336 --> 00:26:57.996 A:middle
No need to launch the Watch app

00:26:57.996 --> 00:26:59.636 A:middle
and swipe from page to page.

00:26:59.966 --> 00:27:02.376 A:middle
People can trust that SailBoss

00:27:02.426 --> 00:27:03.496 A:middle
will let them know when

00:27:03.496 --> 00:27:04.636 A:middle
conditions are awesome.

00:27:05.766 --> 00:27:07.056 A:middle
In fact, we could even include

00:27:07.056 --> 00:27:08.366 A:middle
some graphics to show that the

00:27:08.366 --> 00:27:09.806 A:middle
wind is in their comfort zone,

00:27:10.036 --> 00:27:12.856 A:middle
highlighted and vivid SailBoss

00:27:12.916 --> 00:27:13.366 A:middle
green.

00:27:14.026 --> 00:27:15.986 A:middle
And we could provide actions.

00:27:16.186 --> 00:27:17.706 A:middle
Simple stuff that could help us

00:27:17.746 --> 00:27:19.486 A:middle
tune future notifications.

00:27:19.926 --> 00:27:21.026 A:middle
This would help us learn more

00:27:21.026 --> 00:27:23.206 A:middle
about each person who taps each

00:27:23.206 --> 00:27:24.846 A:middle
one of these actions, and

00:27:25.046 --> 00:27:26.926 A:middle
therefore provide even more

00:27:26.926 --> 00:27:28.456 A:middle
personalized information to them

00:27:28.456 --> 00:27:29.086 A:middle
in the future.

00:27:29.656 --> 00:27:35.106 A:middle
Ok. In this example, we focused

00:27:35.186 --> 00:27:36.336 A:middle
on a single feature.

00:27:36.456 --> 00:27:37.436 A:middle
A single question.

00:27:37.436 --> 00:27:39.026 A:middle
And we've arrived at what I

00:27:39.026 --> 00:27:40.776 A:middle
think is a decent hypothesis for

00:27:40.776 --> 00:27:41.666 A:middle
what we should build.

00:27:42.936 --> 00:27:44.486 A:middle
This is what I mean by planning

00:27:44.486 --> 00:27:45.726 A:middle
for Apple Watch, clearly

00:27:45.726 --> 00:27:48.036 A:middle
defining how your app will take

00:27:48.036 --> 00:27:49.886 A:middle
advantage of the small screen,

00:27:50.366 --> 00:27:52.276 A:middle
the context of use, and the

00:27:52.276 --> 00:27:54.266 A:middle
Apple Watch platform components.

00:27:54.996 --> 00:27:57.376 A:middle
But, too much of anything is

00:27:57.376 --> 00:27:58.006 A:middle
unhealthy.

00:27:59.296 --> 00:28:00.936 A:middle
You need to know how this lands

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:02.396 A:middle
with the people who you're your

00:28:02.396 --> 00:28:02.636 A:middle
app.

00:28:03.036 --> 00:28:04.886 A:middle
You need to see how people use,

00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:06.966 A:middle
or don't use your feature.

00:28:07.116 --> 00:28:08.006 A:middle
What they love and what they

00:28:08.006 --> 00:28:08.356 A:middle
don't.

00:28:08.706 --> 00:28:10.096 A:middle
So, I'm going to turn it over to

00:28:10.096 --> 00:28:11.906 A:middle
Jake to walk you through a

00:28:11.906 --> 00:28:14.036 A:middle
real-life example of what we've

00:28:14.036 --> 00:28:15.196 A:middle
learned over the past three

00:28:15.196 --> 00:28:17.456 A:middle
versions of the WWDC app.

00:28:18.516 --> 00:28:25.166 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:25.666 --> 00:28:26.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Doug.

00:28:27.606 --> 00:28:29.386 A:middle
My name is Jake Behrens, and I'm

00:28:29.386 --> 00:28:30.836 A:middle
the Apple Watch Technologies

00:28:30.836 --> 00:28:31.606 A:middle
Evangelist.

00:28:32.336 --> 00:28:33.736 A:middle
Now, as well as being an

00:28:33.736 --> 00:28:36.126 A:middle
evangelist, I'm also an engineer

00:28:36.126 --> 00:28:38.566 A:middle
on the WWDC App.

00:28:39.476 --> 00:28:41.636 A:middle
At Apple we're pretty secretive

00:28:41.636 --> 00:28:43.536 A:middle
about our development process.

00:28:43.796 --> 00:28:46.126 A:middle
But today I want to do something

00:28:46.126 --> 00:28:46.616 A:middle
different.

00:28:47.196 --> 00:28:49.496 A:middle
I want to pull back that curtain

00:28:49.746 --> 00:28:51.036 A:middle
and I want to give you a

00:28:51.036 --> 00:28:53.506 A:middle
behind-the-scenes look at how we

00:28:53.506 --> 00:28:56.226 A:middle
developed the WWDC app on

00:28:56.226 --> 00:28:57.076 A:middle
watchOS.

00:28:57.426 --> 00:28:59.516 A:middle
Version by version, over the

00:28:59.516 --> 00:29:01.246 A:middle
last three years.

00:29:01.806 --> 00:29:03.736 A:middle
Now, I want to share with you

00:29:03.736 --> 00:29:06.656 A:middle
our experiences and our missteps

00:29:06.656 --> 00:29:07.466 A:middle
along the way.

00:29:08.466 --> 00:29:10.376 A:middle
In doing this, I'm hoping to

00:29:10.376 --> 00:29:12.536 A:middle
impart some things for you to

00:29:12.536 --> 00:29:15.016 A:middle
gain insight on and areas for

00:29:15.016 --> 00:29:17.306 A:middle
you to stay mindful of as you

00:29:17.306 --> 00:29:19.606 A:middle
develop your own Watch apps.

00:29:20.096 --> 00:29:21.806 A:middle
Maybe you have a great app

00:29:21.806 --> 00:29:23.206 A:middle
that's doing well in the store.

00:29:23.606 --> 00:29:25.216 A:middle
Or maybe you're just starting to

00:29:25.216 --> 00:29:26.466 A:middle
think of creating one.

00:29:27.066 --> 00:29:29.016 A:middle
Either way, I think you'll come

00:29:29.016 --> 00:29:29.916 A:middle
away with something.

00:29:31.296 --> 00:29:34.646 A:middle
So, our current app is optimized

00:29:34.646 --> 00:29:37.986 A:middle
for watchOS 3.2, but to give you

00:29:37.986 --> 00:29:39.866 A:middle
the full scope of where we've

00:29:39.946 --> 00:29:42.366 A:middle
been and how we got here, we

00:29:42.366 --> 00:29:43.856 A:middle
need to step all the way back.

00:29:44.476 --> 00:29:46.756 A:middle
All the way back to watchOS 1.

00:29:46.986 --> 00:29:48.916 A:middle
And the app that we created for

00:29:49.396 --> 00:29:49.463 A:middle
it.

00:29:49.926 --> 00:29:52.626 A:middle
Now, when watchOS 1 was

00:29:52.626 --> 00:29:56.846 A:middle
released, well WWDC 2015 was

00:29:56.846 --> 00:29:57.976 A:middle
right around the corner.

00:29:58.466 --> 00:30:00.636 A:middle
And we were already preparing

00:30:00.636 --> 00:30:02.586 A:middle
the iOS app for that year.

00:30:03.496 --> 00:30:04.836 A:middle
Now, this app would let you

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:06.946 A:middle
browse the schedule, add

00:30:06.946 --> 00:30:08.286 A:middle
favorite sessions.

00:30:09.026 --> 00:30:10.686 A:middle
Look at the maps to the venue,

00:30:11.236 --> 00:30:12.936 A:middle
read news throughout the week,

00:30:13.396 --> 00:30:16.146 A:middle
and view streaming videos, or

00:30:16.146 --> 00:30:17.926 A:middle
videos from previous years.

00:30:18.846 --> 00:30:20.586 A:middle
But, now it was time for us to

00:30:20.586 --> 00:30:22.496 A:middle
decide what contextually made

00:30:22.496 --> 00:30:23.576 A:middle
sense for the wrist.

00:30:24.896 --> 00:30:27.536 A:middle
So, we had these 4 areas.

00:30:28.236 --> 00:30:30.706 A:middle
First we had schedule, and the

00:30:30.706 --> 00:30:32.126 A:middle
schedule was a no-brainer.

00:30:32.326 --> 00:30:34.146 A:middle
That was the most crucial piece

00:30:34.146 --> 00:30:35.386 A:middle
of information that we could

00:30:35.386 --> 00:30:37.806 A:middle
provide at a glance to somebody

00:30:37.806 --> 00:30:38.776 A:middle
on the go.

00:30:39.736 --> 00:30:42.726 A:middle
Next, we had maps.

00:30:42.726 --> 00:30:43.926 A:middle
Maps not so much.

00:30:44.416 --> 00:30:45.706 A:middle
When you're at the actual

00:30:45.706 --> 00:30:47.236 A:middle
conference, the venue is

00:30:47.236 --> 00:30:49.666 A:middle
typically one building with

00:30:49.666 --> 00:30:51.286 A:middle
multiple floors and different

00:30:51.286 --> 00:30:52.266 A:middle
rooms everywhere.

00:30:52.616 --> 00:30:54.146 A:middle
And to get through that

00:30:54.146 --> 00:30:56.306 A:middle
experience on Apple Watch, well

00:30:56.306 --> 00:30:57.396 A:middle
we felt that that was best

00:30:57.396 --> 00:30:59.036 A:middle
served through the iOS app.

00:30:59.356 --> 00:31:00.666 A:middle
And really, honestly, if you're

00:31:00.926 --> 00:31:02.456 A:middle
staring that iOS app at the

00:31:02.456 --> 00:31:04.176 A:middle
conference, you could also look

00:31:04.176 --> 00:31:06.016 A:middle
up into the real world and see

00:31:06.016 --> 00:31:07.046 A:middle
the signs around you.

00:31:07.506 --> 00:31:08.556 A:middle
I know it's farfetched.

00:31:09.376 --> 00:31:10.206 A:middle
But you can.

00:31:11.356 --> 00:31:13.306 A:middle
Then, we had news.

00:31:13.616 --> 00:31:15.426 A:middle
And for the time being we

00:31:15.426 --> 00:31:16.916 A:middle
thought that news made sense.

00:31:17.176 --> 00:31:18.846 A:middle
We have critical information

00:31:18.846 --> 00:31:19.746 A:middle
that we shared throughout the

00:31:19.746 --> 00:31:21.626 A:middle
week, and so we wanted to make

00:31:21.626 --> 00:31:23.236 A:middle
sure that somebody had access to

00:31:23.236 --> 00:31:23.986 A:middle
that quickly.

00:31:24.836 --> 00:31:26.556 A:middle
More on that in a bit.

00:31:27.006 --> 00:31:28.696 A:middle
Finally, we had videos.

00:31:28.966 --> 00:31:31.206 A:middle
And videos, we cut right away.

00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:33.086 A:middle
It just didn't seem to make

00:31:33.146 --> 00:31:34.876 A:middle
sense to have that long form

00:31:34.876 --> 00:31:36.296 A:middle
video on your wrist.

00:31:36.676 --> 00:31:38.116 A:middle
Could you imagine holding your

00:31:38.116 --> 00:31:39.856 A:middle
wrist for 40 to 60 minutes.

00:31:40.636 --> 00:31:42.326 A:middle
The arm gets a lot more beefier

00:31:42.326 --> 00:31:42.936 A:middle
than the other.

00:31:43.966 --> 00:31:46.806 A:middle
So, we have these key areas.

00:31:47.216 --> 00:31:48.726 A:middle
So, let's look at the original

00:31:48.726 --> 00:31:50.926 A:middle
Photoshop mockup that we made

00:31:51.096 --> 00:31:52.166 A:middle
for Watch app.

00:31:52.756 --> 00:31:53.856 A:middle
You can see here that we

00:31:53.856 --> 00:31:55.276 A:middle
actually took the schedule and

00:31:55.276 --> 00:31:56.896 A:middle
we broke it down into three

00:31:56.896 --> 00:31:57.856 A:middle
distinct areas.

00:31:58.256 --> 00:32:00.246 A:middle
We had sessions, labs and

00:32:00.246 --> 00:32:00.966 A:middle
favorites.

00:32:01.616 --> 00:32:03.446 A:middle
And we also had the news.

00:32:04.156 --> 00:32:05.456 A:middle
Now, why did we break the

00:32:05.456 --> 00:32:06.366 A:middle
schedule part?

00:32:06.796 --> 00:32:08.486 A:middle
Well, there was a lot of

00:32:08.486 --> 00:32:10.056 A:middle
information to get across.

00:32:10.476 --> 00:32:11.576 A:middle
I mean at the beginning of the

00:32:11.576 --> 00:32:13.726 A:middle
week, you'd have over 100

00:32:13.726 --> 00:32:16.166 A:middle
sessions, and over 100 labs.

00:32:16.456 --> 00:32:17.886 A:middle
And we wanted to make sure that

00:32:17.886 --> 00:32:19.126 A:middle
someone could get around

00:32:19.126 --> 00:32:20.896 A:middle
exploring all of that content

00:32:20.896 --> 00:32:22.216 A:middle
really easily and quickly.

00:32:23.356 --> 00:32:25.736 A:middle
Now, full disclosure here.

00:32:26.226 --> 00:32:28.266 A:middle
This should've sent up huge red

00:32:28.266 --> 00:32:30.206 A:middle
flags that we were putting way

00:32:30.206 --> 00:32:31.596 A:middle
too much information into the

00:32:31.596 --> 00:32:32.946 A:middle
Watch app experience.

00:32:33.446 --> 00:32:34.916 A:middle
We were trying to break apart

00:32:34.916 --> 00:32:36.646 A:middle
all this content so that you

00:32:36.646 --> 00:32:38.206 A:middle
could get in and out.

00:32:39.006 --> 00:32:40.686 A:middle
Well we'll talk more about this.

00:32:41.226 --> 00:32:42.396 A:middle
I mean, I can definitely

00:32:42.396 --> 00:32:44.396 A:middle
sympathize that when you first

00:32:44.396 --> 00:32:46.576 A:middle
start creating apps for watchOS,

00:32:47.006 --> 00:32:48.686 A:middle
it's a whole different ballgame.

00:32:49.026 --> 00:32:50.236 A:middle
You're used to creating these

00:32:50.306 --> 00:32:52.496 A:middle
deep, reach experiences for iOS

00:32:53.166 --> 00:32:54.636 A:middle
and you start stripping things

00:32:54.636 --> 00:32:56.306 A:middle
away for a great Watch app

00:32:56.306 --> 00:32:58.066 A:middle
experience, but then you start

00:32:58.066 --> 00:32:59.676 A:middle
feeling like you're stripping

00:32:59.676 --> 00:33:00.606 A:middle
too much away.

00:33:00.746 --> 00:33:02.266 A:middle
And it's getting too minimal.

00:33:02.796 --> 00:33:04.886 A:middle
And you start feeling that maybe

00:33:04.886 --> 00:33:06.996 A:middle
you should add more features to

00:33:06.996 --> 00:33:10.066 A:middle
add "value" to that experience.

00:33:10.426 --> 00:33:11.716 A:middle
And we've learned over time that

00:33:11.716 --> 00:33:13.196 A:middle
that's just not the case.

00:33:13.376 --> 00:33:15.086 A:middle
But when you first start out,

00:33:15.086 --> 00:33:17.096 A:middle
that's a tricky scenario to get

00:33:17.096 --> 00:33:17.546 A:middle
into.

00:33:18.766 --> 00:33:20.766 A:middle
So, we also had news.

00:33:21.036 --> 00:33:22.116 A:middle
Let's talk about that.

00:33:23.036 --> 00:33:25.676 A:middle
With news, we found taking that

00:33:25.676 --> 00:33:27.826 A:middle
plan and actually implementing

00:33:27.826 --> 00:33:30.196 A:middle
it and walking around for a week

00:33:30.196 --> 00:33:32.366 A:middle
with it on our wrist, that you

00:33:32.366 --> 00:33:34.426 A:middle
had these news items, but the

00:33:34.426 --> 00:33:35.806 A:middle
items were a bit long.

00:33:35.806 --> 00:33:37.066 A:middle
So, we couldn't have just one

00:33:37.066 --> 00:33:38.426 A:middle
gigantic list of them.

00:33:38.756 --> 00:33:40.496 A:middle
So, we actually needed to tap on

00:33:40.496 --> 00:33:42.306 A:middle
news, get to a list of news

00:33:42.306 --> 00:33:44.276 A:middle
items, then you tap on one, and

00:33:44.276 --> 00:33:46.456 A:middle
go into the details, where then

00:33:46.456 --> 00:33:47.626 A:middle
you had all this text that you

00:33:47.626 --> 00:33:48.546 A:middle
would scroll through.

00:33:48.826 --> 00:33:50.206 A:middle
And just the whole process of

00:33:50.206 --> 00:33:51.726 A:middle
going in that navigation

00:33:51.726 --> 00:33:53.546 A:middle
structure and back out to get to

00:33:53.546 --> 00:33:54.796 A:middle
your sessions, it was just

00:33:54.796 --> 00:33:55.796 A:middle
taking too long.

00:33:56.206 --> 00:33:58.126 A:middle
So, we actually decided before

00:33:58.126 --> 00:33:59.626 A:middle
release to even cut that out.

00:34:01.736 --> 00:34:03.636 A:middle
So, here's what we actually

00:34:03.966 --> 00:34:06.086 A:middle
shipped for watchOS 1.

00:34:06.656 --> 00:34:08.756 A:middle
We shipped the sessions, labs

00:34:08.886 --> 00:34:09.746 A:middle
and favorites.

00:34:10.426 --> 00:34:13.186 A:middle
Now if I were Doug right now I

00:34:13.186 --> 00:34:15.256 A:middle
would say is this legible?

00:34:15.496 --> 00:34:17.766 A:middle
Yes. Is it concise?

00:34:17.766 --> 00:34:20.426 A:middle
Well, it wasn't as concise as it

00:34:20.466 --> 00:34:21.156 A:middle
could have been.

00:34:21.896 --> 00:34:23.266 A:middle
So, we needed to learn from that

00:34:23.266 --> 00:34:24.016 A:middle
experience.

00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:26.516 A:middle
Now, we had some built-in

00:34:26.516 --> 00:34:28.996 A:middle
analytics to see where people

00:34:28.996 --> 00:34:31.046 A:middle
were landing and what area of

00:34:31.046 --> 00:34:32.646 A:middle
the app that they really valued

00:34:32.906 --> 00:34:34.636 A:middle
to make it really personal for

00:34:34.636 --> 00:34:34.746 A:middle
them.

00:34:34.746 --> 00:34:36.916 A:middle
And we found that they loved

00:34:36.916 --> 00:34:38.356 A:middle
this list of favorites.

00:34:39.106 --> 00:34:41.046 A:middle
Even from this list, we had

00:34:41.116 --> 00:34:42.316 A:middle
where you could tap on one of

00:34:42.316 --> 00:34:43.996 A:middle
these favorites and then it

00:34:43.996 --> 00:34:45.096 A:middle
would give you more detailed

00:34:45.096 --> 00:34:46.786 A:middle
information; like the session

00:34:46.786 --> 00:34:47.486 A:middle
description.

00:34:48.046 --> 00:34:49.316 A:middle
And you could use the force

00:34:49.316 --> 00:34:50.826 A:middle
touch menu to favorite or

00:34:50.826 --> 00:34:52.086 A:middle
unfavorite a session.

00:34:52.546 --> 00:34:55.586 A:middle
But, what we found was that that

00:34:55.586 --> 00:34:58.286 A:middle
process was taking too long, and

00:34:58.606 --> 00:35:00.136 A:middle
not a lot of people were using

00:35:00.136 --> 00:35:00.376 A:middle
this.

00:35:00.836 --> 00:35:02.616 A:middle
They were all using that list

00:35:02.616 --> 00:35:04.056 A:middle
right in the middle, because it

00:35:04.056 --> 00:35:05.706 A:middle
was the things they cared about

00:35:05.706 --> 00:35:07.156 A:middle
and it was really quick to

00:35:07.156 --> 00:35:07.886 A:middle
glance at.

00:35:07.936 --> 00:35:11.256 A:middle
I mean we now know, as of

00:35:11.306 --> 00:35:13.996 A:middle
watchOS 3 that really great

00:35:14.146 --> 00:35:16.926 A:middle
tasks on Apple Watch take about

00:35:16.926 --> 00:35:18.046 A:middle
2 seconds.

00:35:18.596 --> 00:35:20.766 A:middle
And for a non-nervous,

00:35:20.766 --> 00:35:22.516 A:middle
non-jittery person it takes

00:35:22.516 --> 00:35:24.966 A:middle
about 2 seconds to say 2

00:35:24.966 --> 00:35:25.726 A:middle
seconds.

00:35:27.256 --> 00:35:29.416 A:middle
But, this whole process of going

00:35:29.416 --> 00:35:30.936 A:middle
down the navigation stack and

00:35:30.936 --> 00:35:33.156 A:middle
coming back up, it was actually

00:35:33.156 --> 00:35:35.156 A:middle
taking more like 5 seconds.

00:35:35.306 --> 00:35:36.756 A:middle
And that was just too long of an

00:35:36.756 --> 00:35:37.576 A:middle
experience.

00:35:37.576 --> 00:35:41.176 A:middle
So, what did we learn?

00:35:42.016 --> 00:35:43.836 A:middle
Well, watchOS 1 taught us that

00:35:44.006 --> 00:35:45.816 A:middle
we really needed to identify

00:35:45.816 --> 00:35:47.286 A:middle
what was most essential.

00:35:47.446 --> 00:35:49.676 A:middle
Find that single feature.

00:35:49.756 --> 00:35:51.246 A:middle
That one thing that you can

00:35:51.246 --> 00:35:54.176 A:middle
provide for the person.

00:35:54.716 --> 00:35:56.176 A:middle
All right.

00:35:56.416 --> 00:35:59.386 A:middle
So, we moved from watchOS 1 and

00:35:59.386 --> 00:35:59.956 A:middle
we learned.

00:36:00.236 --> 00:36:01.646 A:middle
And we went to watchOS 2 the

00:36:01.646 --> 00:36:02.326 A:middle
next year.

00:36:02.566 --> 00:36:05.086 A:middle
And we needed to do one key

00:36:05.086 --> 00:36:06.496 A:middle
thing in watchOS 2.

00:36:06.496 --> 00:36:08.706 A:middle
We needed to focus.

00:36:09.436 --> 00:36:10.146 A:middle
Seriously.

00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:12.736 A:middle
We really needed to focus on the

00:36:12.736 --> 00:36:13.636 A:middle
feature set.

00:36:13.936 --> 00:36:16.366 A:middle
We needed to focus on the person

00:36:16.576 --> 00:36:17.636 A:middle
and what they wanted.

00:36:18.976 --> 00:36:20.426 A:middle
We needed to hone in on those

00:36:20.426 --> 00:36:22.226 A:middle
principles that Doug has spoken

00:36:22.226 --> 00:36:22.616 A:middle
about.

00:36:23.176 --> 00:36:24.366 A:middle
And we needed to re-ask

00:36:24.366 --> 00:36:26.636 A:middle
ourselves, what do people really

00:36:26.636 --> 00:36:28.716 A:middle
want on their wrist.

00:36:29.436 --> 00:36:30.916 A:middle
But not just anyone.

00:36:31.436 --> 00:36:33.616 A:middle
What do people really want from

00:36:33.616 --> 00:36:36.086 A:middle
the WWDC app on their wrist.

00:36:36.386 --> 00:36:37.986 A:middle
What is the one thing?

00:36:37.986 --> 00:36:39.576 A:middle
That one piece of information

00:36:39.576 --> 00:36:40.786 A:middle
that we can provide them?

00:36:41.816 --> 00:36:45.026 A:middle
Well, we knew from feedback that

00:36:45.026 --> 00:36:46.966 A:middle
they really loved the glance in

00:36:46.966 --> 00:36:49.156 A:middle
watchOS 1 because it showed them

00:36:49.156 --> 00:36:52.056 A:middle
this concise view of what was

00:36:52.056 --> 00:36:52.836 A:middle
right now.

00:36:52.836 --> 00:36:54.546 A:middle
What was upcoming.

00:36:54.966 --> 00:36:57.326 A:middle
And they really liked that.

00:36:57.606 --> 00:36:59.696 A:middle
So, we knew that we needed to

00:36:59.696 --> 00:37:01.346 A:middle
provide the schedule in some

00:37:01.346 --> 00:37:02.796 A:middle
sort of way, right.

00:37:03.646 --> 00:37:04.836 A:middle
So, we looked at what we were

00:37:04.836 --> 00:37:05.626 A:middle
offering here.

00:37:05.716 --> 00:37:06.826 A:middle
We had sessions.

00:37:07.206 --> 00:37:08.576 A:middle
We had labs, and we had

00:37:08.576 --> 00:37:09.306 A:middle
favorites.

00:37:09.596 --> 00:37:12.126 A:middle
Well, as I said it was a lot of

00:37:12.126 --> 00:37:13.806 A:middle
content if you wanted to

00:37:13.806 --> 00:37:14.666 A:middle
explore.

00:37:15.046 --> 00:37:17.816 A:middle
So, we decided maybe we should

00:37:17.816 --> 00:37:19.736 A:middle
just take sessions and labs out.

00:37:20.556 --> 00:37:22.446 A:middle
Maybe we should go all the way

00:37:22.746 --> 00:37:25.066 A:middle
and just make it very, very

00:37:25.066 --> 00:37:27.226 A:middle
personal of an experience and

00:37:27.226 --> 00:37:28.946 A:middle
really focus on favorites.

00:37:30.566 --> 00:37:32.106 A:middle
We had this master detail

00:37:32.106 --> 00:37:34.666 A:middle
navigation structure and so we

00:37:34.666 --> 00:37:36.566 A:middle
looked at it spread out, and we

00:37:36.566 --> 00:37:38.056 A:middle
just said, well this seems

00:37:38.566 --> 00:37:39.856 A:middle
pretty straightforward.

00:37:40.056 --> 00:37:40.936 A:middle
We're going to take this

00:37:40.936 --> 00:37:42.506 A:middle
navigation structure and just

00:37:42.546 --> 00:37:43.596 A:middle
condense it down.

00:37:44.276 --> 00:37:46.516 A:middle
Get that list of favorites that

00:37:46.516 --> 00:37:47.396 A:middle
everyone wanted.

00:37:48.796 --> 00:37:50.116 A:middle
So, this is what we shipped for

00:37:50.116 --> 00:37:50.996 A:middle
watchOS 2.

00:37:51.456 --> 00:37:54.446 A:middle
We went down to only favorites.

00:37:54.696 --> 00:37:56.846 A:middle
And now, not only did we go down

00:37:56.846 --> 00:37:57.626 A:middle
to favorites.

00:37:57.886 --> 00:37:59.906 A:middle
We also made it so that it was

00:37:59.906 --> 00:38:02.556 A:middle
only favorites from now until

00:38:02.556 --> 00:38:03.766 A:middle
the end of the conference.

00:38:04.136 --> 00:38:05.676 A:middle
So, this was something that we

00:38:05.676 --> 00:38:07.886 A:middle
don't even provide in the iOS

00:38:07.886 --> 00:38:08.116 A:middle
app.

00:38:08.346 --> 00:38:10.666 A:middle
This is a feature that is only

00:38:10.666 --> 00:38:12.206 A:middle
on Apple Watch, right.

00:38:12.206 --> 00:38:14.276 A:middle
On iOS you can actually look at

00:38:14.276 --> 00:38:15.716 A:middle
your previous favorites from the

00:38:15.716 --> 00:38:17.276 A:middle
week, because you can get that

00:38:17.276 --> 00:38:18.236 A:middle
rich experience.

00:38:18.236 --> 00:38:19.286 A:middle
You can explore.

00:38:19.846 --> 00:38:21.666 A:middle
But on the Watch, it really

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:23.666 A:middle
makes more sense to just have

00:38:24.166 --> 00:38:26.056 A:middle
what's now and what's coming.

00:38:28.156 --> 00:38:30.326 A:middle
Another thing to note here is a

00:38:30.326 --> 00:38:31.206 A:middle
small detail.

00:38:32.056 --> 00:38:34.086 A:middle
In watchOS 1, our table section

00:38:34.086 --> 00:38:35.926 A:middle
headers above sessions, were

00:38:35.926 --> 00:38:37.636 A:middle
dates, and time ranges.

00:38:38.096 --> 00:38:39.386 A:middle
Not very glanceable.

00:38:39.816 --> 00:38:42.126 A:middle
So, what we did was we actually

00:38:42.216 --> 00:38:44.076 A:middle
made this more legible.

00:38:44.226 --> 00:38:47.136 A:middle
It's amazing what one word, the

00:38:47.296 --> 00:38:49.536 A:middle
placement of one word can do for

00:38:49.536 --> 00:38:50.886 A:middle
your apps experience.

00:38:51.316 --> 00:38:53.446 A:middle
You can see here that we used

00:38:53.446 --> 00:38:56.466 A:middle
words like now and upcoming to

00:38:56.466 --> 00:38:58.976 A:middle
show you what was actually going

00:38:58.976 --> 00:38:59.416 A:middle
on.

00:38:59.416 --> 00:39:00.856 A:middle
You could quickly glance at the

00:39:00.856 --> 00:39:04.006 A:middle
app and know, oh okay, I can't

00:39:04.006 --> 00:39:05.696 A:middle
go for coffee right now because

00:39:05.696 --> 00:39:06.696 A:middle
I'm actually supposed to be in

00:39:06.696 --> 00:39:07.656 A:middle
this other session.

00:39:07.946 --> 00:39:09.796 A:middle
Later, I don't have one upcoming

00:39:09.796 --> 00:39:11.866 A:middle
until further out, so I can go.

00:39:12.956 --> 00:39:14.816 A:middle
It's these small details that

00:39:14.816 --> 00:39:16.626 A:middle
add to that personal experience.

00:39:18.576 --> 00:39:21.636 A:middle
Now, in watchOS 2, we took full

00:39:21.636 --> 00:39:23.386 A:middle
advantage of complications,

00:39:23.386 --> 00:39:24.986 A:middle
which were introduced in watchOS

00:39:24.986 --> 00:39:25.256 A:middle
2.

00:39:25.626 --> 00:39:26.816 A:middle
That timeliness.

00:39:27.506 --> 00:39:29.616 A:middle
And if people wanted to have

00:39:29.616 --> 00:39:30.876 A:middle
their favorites on their Watch

00:39:30.876 --> 00:39:32.776 A:middle
face, they could enable the

00:39:32.776 --> 00:39:34.706 A:middle
large slot on the modular Watch

00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:36.396 A:middle
face and take advantage of that.

00:39:37.036 --> 00:39:38.686 A:middle
But we also wanted them to be

00:39:38.686 --> 00:39:40.596 A:middle
able to get to our content no

00:39:40.596 --> 00:39:42.446 A:middle
matter what kind of Watch face

00:39:42.446 --> 00:39:43.036 A:middle
they used.

00:39:43.526 --> 00:39:45.736 A:middle
And we went through a lot of

00:39:45.736 --> 00:39:48.356 A:middle
struggle of like, do we provide

00:39:48.546 --> 00:39:49.876 A:middle
something that just launches

00:39:49.876 --> 00:39:51.726 A:middle
them to our app, or what can we

00:39:51.726 --> 00:39:53.456 A:middle
provide in these smaller areas.

00:39:53.486 --> 00:39:55.146 A:middle
And really when it came down to

00:39:55.146 --> 00:39:56.856 A:middle
it, we found that with the

00:39:56.856 --> 00:39:58.046 A:middle
information that we had, there

00:39:58.046 --> 00:39:59.186 A:middle
wasn't anything that was

00:39:59.186 --> 00:40:00.766 A:middle
amazingly valuable in that

00:40:00.766 --> 00:40:02.616 A:middle
constrained, confined amount of

00:40:02.616 --> 00:40:02.976 A:middle
space.

00:40:03.676 --> 00:40:05.356 A:middle
And so, we actually went ahead

00:40:05.356 --> 00:40:06.886 A:middle
and used launchers.

00:40:07.166 --> 00:40:08.606 A:middle
But we made some custom ones for

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:10.316 A:middle
the different slot styles, so

00:40:10.546 --> 00:40:12.366 A:middle
that you know it blended in a

00:40:12.366 --> 00:40:13.676 A:middle
little bit more nicely with the

00:40:13.676 --> 00:40:16.186 A:middle
experience, and we did this for

00:40:16.186 --> 00:40:17.126 A:middle
two reasons.

00:40:17.266 --> 00:40:18.846 A:middle
The first reason I spoke about

00:40:18.846 --> 00:40:20.446 A:middle
was that preference factor,

00:40:20.716 --> 00:40:21.606 A:middle
right.

00:40:21.606 --> 00:40:22.986 A:middle
What if they use a different

00:40:22.986 --> 00:40:24.026 A:middle
kind of watch face?

00:40:24.026 --> 00:40:26.436 A:middle
We want to allow them to do that

00:40:26.436 --> 00:40:28.146 A:middle
and still have quick access to

00:40:28.146 --> 00:40:28.866 A:middle
the content.

00:40:29.676 --> 00:40:31.416 A:middle
But, we did this for a second

00:40:31.416 --> 00:40:32.386 A:middle
reason as well.

00:40:33.296 --> 00:40:34.556 A:middle
App discovery.

00:40:35.476 --> 00:40:38.596 A:middle
If you only support one or a few

00:40:38.596 --> 00:40:40.656 A:middle
type of complication styles,

00:40:41.276 --> 00:40:43.326 A:middle
then if they use a different

00:40:43.326 --> 00:40:45.226 A:middle
type of Watch face, say utility,

00:40:45.226 --> 00:40:47.436 A:middle
and we don't supply any of those

00:40:47.436 --> 00:40:49.876 A:middle
types of utility slots of

00:40:49.876 --> 00:40:51.536 A:middle
complications, when they go to

00:40:51.536 --> 00:40:53.376 A:middle
configure their Watch face, they

00:40:53.376 --> 00:40:55.036 A:middle
won't even see our app name.

00:40:55.086 --> 00:40:57.326 A:middle
And so, they may think, well I

00:40:57.326 --> 00:40:58.246 A:middle
guess they just don't have a

00:40:58.246 --> 00:40:59.136 A:middle
complication.

00:40:59.396 --> 00:41:00.396 A:middle
So, we wanted to be

00:41:00.396 --> 00:41:01.286 A:middle
discoverable.

00:41:01.556 --> 00:41:03.556 A:middle
And fit in to how they use Apple

00:41:03.556 --> 00:41:04.166 A:middle
Watch.

00:41:05.346 --> 00:41:07.666 A:middle
So, as I said, we provided

00:41:07.666 --> 00:41:09.386 A:middle
launchers because this really is

00:41:09.386 --> 00:41:10.106 A:middle
constrained.

00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:12.826 A:middle
You want to talk constrained, 36

00:41:12.826 --> 00:41:14.876 A:middle
x 36 pixels for this one.

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:16.576 A:middle
Right? If you want to sound

00:41:16.576 --> 00:41:18.526 A:middle
super fancy, you can say 18

00:41:18.526 --> 00:41:20.286 A:middle
points by 18 points at 2x,

00:41:20.346 --> 00:41:21.626 A:middle
because it's a retina screen,

00:41:22.506 --> 00:41:22.886 A:middle
but.

00:41:24.316 --> 00:41:26.696 A:middle
Here for watchOS 2 what did we

00:41:26.696 --> 00:41:27.066 A:middle
learn?

00:41:27.786 --> 00:41:29.556 A:middle
Well, we learned that you really

00:41:29.556 --> 00:41:30.886 A:middle
need to focus your feature set.

00:41:31.276 --> 00:41:32.366 A:middle
Really look at what you're

00:41:32.366 --> 00:41:35.736 A:middle
providing and hone in on what

00:41:35.736 --> 00:41:36.756 A:middle
means the most.

00:41:37.226 --> 00:41:39.346 A:middle
What's that one thing?

00:41:40.706 --> 00:41:43.616 A:middle
Okay, so now we go to watchOS 2

00:41:44.186 --> 00:41:46.446 A:middle
to watchOS 3, and where our app

00:41:46.446 --> 00:41:47.306 A:middle
currently is.

00:41:48.596 --> 00:41:50.106 A:middle
So, if you look at the current

00:41:50.106 --> 00:41:51.736 A:middle
app, you may even have it right

00:41:51.736 --> 00:41:54.386 A:middle
now, it doesn't look a whole lot

00:41:54.386 --> 00:41:54.836 A:middle
different.

00:41:54.836 --> 00:41:56.216 A:middle
Actually, if you look at it side

00:41:56.216 --> 00:41:58.396 A:middle
by side with watchOS 2, you'll

00:41:58.396 --> 00:42:00.016 A:middle
notice we didn't change the

00:42:00.016 --> 00:42:00.856 A:middle
design at all.

00:42:01.456 --> 00:42:02.716 A:middle
And that's because we found

00:42:02.716 --> 00:42:04.026 A:middle
something that was working

00:42:04.026 --> 00:42:06.356 A:middle
really well, that was applying

00:42:06.356 --> 00:42:07.386 A:middle
these principles.

00:42:08.306 --> 00:42:09.666 A:middle
But that doesn't mean that we

00:42:09.666 --> 00:42:10.556 A:middle
just left it.

00:42:11.176 --> 00:42:12.796 A:middle
We moved it to the current

00:42:12.796 --> 00:42:14.306 A:middle
version of the OS so that we

00:42:14.306 --> 00:42:16.446 A:middle
could take advantage of what

00:42:16.446 --> 00:42:17.816 A:middle
that offers.

00:42:18.526 --> 00:42:20.086 A:middle
Staying current and staying

00:42:20.086 --> 00:42:21.826 A:middle
state-of-the-art, is just as

00:42:21.826 --> 00:42:23.636 A:middle
important as adding new

00:42:23.636 --> 00:42:24.326 A:middle
features.

00:42:24.906 --> 00:42:25.996 A:middle
You don't need to add new

00:42:25.996 --> 00:42:27.816 A:middle
features just to add them.

00:42:28.186 --> 00:42:30.526 A:middle
So, what we did was, we added

00:42:30.526 --> 00:42:32.036 A:middle
support for the extra-large

00:42:32.036 --> 00:42:33.376 A:middle
complication that was now

00:42:33.376 --> 00:42:34.826 A:middle
offered in watchOS 3.

00:42:35.376 --> 00:42:37.246 A:middle
And it's funny, when I put this

00:42:37.246 --> 00:42:38.786 A:middle
in the build, there was a person

00:42:38.786 --> 00:42:40.776 A:middle
in my team, and they first saw

00:42:40.776 --> 00:42:41.746 A:middle
it and they're like oh, this is

00:42:41.746 --> 00:42:42.656 A:middle
really cool.

00:42:42.766 --> 00:42:43.806 A:middle
And they were really excited and

00:42:43.806 --> 00:42:45.526 A:middle
they're like yeah, WWDC is

00:42:45.526 --> 00:42:47.106 A:middle
coming up I can put it all on my

00:42:47.106 --> 00:42:47.956 A:middle
Watch face.

00:42:48.326 --> 00:42:49.516 A:middle
I was like great.

00:42:50.606 --> 00:42:51.126 A:middle
That was me.

00:42:51.476 --> 00:42:55.846 A:middle
But the point is that it adhered

00:42:55.846 --> 00:42:57.866 A:middle
to whatever your preference is.

00:42:57.866 --> 00:42:59.226 A:middle
Whatever you want that

00:42:59.226 --> 00:43:00.786 A:middle
experience to be, you can still

00:43:00.786 --> 00:43:02.636 A:middle
get into that content quickly

00:43:02.636 --> 00:43:03.416 A:middle
and easily.

00:43:04.396 --> 00:43:06.016 A:middle
Another thing that we did was,

00:43:06.016 --> 00:43:08.316 A:middle
we made use of background app

00:43:08.316 --> 00:43:10.046 A:middle
refresh, which was introduced in

00:43:10.046 --> 00:43:10.916 A:middle
watchOS 3.

00:43:11.226 --> 00:43:13.076 A:middle
So, that if you added our app

00:43:13.076 --> 00:43:14.966 A:middle
into the dock, or if you had it

00:43:14.966 --> 00:43:17.396 A:middle
set as an active complication on

00:43:17.396 --> 00:43:19.226 A:middle
your active Watch face, it would

00:43:19.226 --> 00:43:20.916 A:middle
follow you through the day,

00:43:21.136 --> 00:43:22.626 A:middle
updating the schedule and the

00:43:22.686 --> 00:43:24.286 A:middle
time, so that when you went to

00:43:24.286 --> 00:43:25.746 A:middle
the app for more information, it

00:43:25.746 --> 00:43:27.176 A:middle
was already up to date.

00:43:27.176 --> 00:43:29.136 A:middle
And it already should be.

00:43:30.326 --> 00:43:34.436 A:middle
Timely. So, even though we've

00:43:34.436 --> 00:43:37.396 A:middle
only had the app out for about

00:43:37.396 --> 00:43:39.626 A:middle
two weeks, we've already learned

00:43:39.896 --> 00:43:41.996 A:middle
that keeping what works is

00:43:41.996 --> 00:43:42.916 A:middle
really important.

00:43:43.156 --> 00:43:44.306 A:middle
It's very valuable.

00:43:44.306 --> 00:43:45.976 A:middle
Like I said just moving to the

00:43:45.976 --> 00:43:49.386 A:middle
current platform in OS and

00:43:49.386 --> 00:43:51.386 A:middle
taking advantage of it is just

00:43:51.386 --> 00:43:52.106 A:middle
as important.

00:43:53.506 --> 00:43:55.356 A:middle
Now, you may think that this is

00:43:55.356 --> 00:43:56.766 A:middle
where we end, right?

00:43:56.766 --> 00:43:57.646 A:middle
This is our journey.

00:43:57.746 --> 00:43:59.716 A:middle
We're on watchOS 3, we're done.

00:44:00.386 --> 00:44:02.506 A:middle
But, as I said I want to do

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:03.716 A:middle
something different, and I want

00:44:03.716 --> 00:44:05.136 A:middle
to go through this planning

00:44:05.136 --> 00:44:06.976 A:middle
exercise and this thought.

00:44:07.436 --> 00:44:09.356 A:middle
So, let's actually look into the

00:44:09.356 --> 00:44:09.966 A:middle
future.

00:44:10.546 --> 00:44:12.116 A:middle
With the announcement this week

00:44:12.116 --> 00:44:14.246 A:middle
of watchOS 4, we're excited as

00:44:14.246 --> 00:44:15.536 A:middle
well to use some of the new

00:44:15.536 --> 00:44:16.326 A:middle
enhancements.

00:44:16.836 --> 00:44:18.126 A:middle
But, we really need to answer

00:44:18.126 --> 00:44:20.326 A:middle
that question can we make this

00:44:20.376 --> 00:44:20.756 A:middle
better?

00:44:20.756 --> 00:44:22.526 A:middle
Can we make the app experience

00:44:22.606 --> 00:44:24.686 A:middle
even more concise, or even more

00:44:24.686 --> 00:44:26.196 A:middle
legible than before.

00:44:26.566 --> 00:44:28.366 A:middle
And I actually think we can.

00:44:28.556 --> 00:44:29.716 A:middle
I've been kicking around some

00:44:29.716 --> 00:44:30.256 A:middle
ideas.

00:44:30.666 --> 00:44:32.756 A:middle
Doug hasn't really paid too much

00:44:32.756 --> 00:44:34.786 A:middle
attention to them, but we'll get

00:44:34.826 --> 00:44:35.226 A:middle
there.

00:44:35.896 --> 00:44:37.366 A:middle
So, this is our current app on

00:44:37.366 --> 00:44:38.326 A:middle
watchOS 3.

00:44:38.716 --> 00:44:40.416 A:middle
And one thing that I'd like to

00:44:40.416 --> 00:44:42.576 A:middle
do is sometimes when you have a

00:44:42.576 --> 00:44:43.986 A:middle
session title that's pretty

00:44:43.986 --> 00:44:46.576 A:middle
long, it actually almost takes

00:44:46.576 --> 00:44:48.036 A:middle
up the entire screen.

00:44:48.216 --> 00:44:50.326 A:middle
Well, what if we just used the

00:44:50.326 --> 00:44:52.196 A:middle
entire screen per session.

00:44:52.536 --> 00:44:53.946 A:middle
What if we were able to bump up

00:44:53.946 --> 00:44:55.356 A:middle
the text size to make it more

00:44:55.356 --> 00:44:55.976 A:middle
legible.

00:44:56.166 --> 00:44:57.596 A:middle
Make it more concise so that it

00:44:57.596 --> 00:44:59.736 A:middle
is only one session at a time.

00:45:00.846 --> 00:45:02.736 A:middle
So, this is kind of what I put

00:45:02.736 --> 00:45:03.986 A:middle
together so far.

00:45:04.286 --> 00:45:06.296 A:middle
And I found that we can actually

00:45:06.296 --> 00:45:07.666 A:middle
make use of the new vertical

00:45:07.666 --> 00:45:10.046 A:middle
pagination introduced in watchOS

00:45:10.046 --> 00:45:10.476 A:middle
4.

00:45:10.906 --> 00:45:12.346 A:middle
And in the new vertical

00:45:12.346 --> 00:45:14.426 A:middle
pagination, you don't have to

00:45:14.426 --> 00:45:16.366 A:middle
have a master detail navigation

00:45:16.366 --> 00:45:16.946 A:middle
structure.

00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:19.176 A:middle
You can actually just have those

00:45:19.176 --> 00:45:21.256 A:middle
pages as the core part of your

00:45:21.946 --> 00:45:22.026 A:middle
app.

00:45:22.026 --> 00:45:24.386 A:middle
And so, by doing this, we can

00:45:24.456 --> 00:45:26.606 A:middle
increase the text size, so that

00:45:26.606 --> 00:45:28.986 A:middle
we can use the full screen per

00:45:28.986 --> 00:45:29.676 A:middle
session.

00:45:30.036 --> 00:45:31.396 A:middle
And allow the design to breathe

00:45:31.396 --> 00:45:32.256 A:middle
a little bit.

00:45:32.256 --> 00:45:34.216 A:middle
Also, we can add in the track

00:45:34.216 --> 00:45:34.596 A:middle
name.

00:45:35.276 --> 00:45:37.496 A:middle
And then, we can take those

00:45:37.496 --> 00:45:39.436 A:middle
table session headers and we can

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:41.396 A:middle
move those up into the status

00:45:41.466 --> 00:45:41.766 A:middle
bar.

00:45:42.106 --> 00:45:43.656 A:middle
And so, we can still have that

00:45:43.656 --> 00:45:46.956 A:middle
experience of now, upcoming,

00:45:47.416 --> 00:45:48.256 A:middle
tomorrow.

00:45:48.256 --> 00:45:51.316 A:middle
I think that this is something

00:45:51.316 --> 00:45:52.526 A:middle
that could actually work.

00:45:54.696 --> 00:45:57.756 A:middle
So, this also gives us something

00:45:57.756 --> 00:45:58.166 A:middle
else.

00:45:59.066 --> 00:46:01.356 A:middle
By going to this, we can improve

00:46:01.496 --> 00:46:02.316 A:middle
Handoff.

00:46:02.846 --> 00:46:04.596 A:middle
We currently support Handoff,

00:46:04.866 --> 00:46:06.636 A:middle
but as the current app is a list

00:46:06.636 --> 00:46:08.196 A:middle
of favorites, when you use

00:46:08.196 --> 00:46:10.006 A:middle
Handoff, you arrive in an iOS

00:46:10.006 --> 00:46:12.196 A:middle
app at the list of favorites.

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:14.616 A:middle
And that's pretty good, but I

00:46:14.616 --> 00:46:15.856 A:middle
think that we can now take that

00:46:15.856 --> 00:46:18.476 A:middle
a step further by focusing on

00:46:18.476 --> 00:46:20.626 A:middle
one session per page, we can

00:46:20.626 --> 00:46:23.466 A:middle
actually change the information

00:46:23.466 --> 00:46:26.066 A:middle
per page that handoff uses and

00:46:26.066 --> 00:46:27.666 A:middle
get you directly into the

00:46:27.666 --> 00:46:28.296 A:middle
session.

00:46:28.566 --> 00:46:30.106 A:middle
So, that right when you swipe up

00:46:30.106 --> 00:46:31.796 A:middle
from your lock screen, you can

00:46:31.796 --> 00:46:33.396 A:middle
get into the app, you can tap

00:46:33.396 --> 00:46:35.206 A:middle
the play button, and bam, you're

00:46:35.206 --> 00:46:36.136 A:middle
right in the video.

00:46:36.436 --> 00:46:37.396 A:middle
I think that would be a lot

00:46:37.396 --> 00:46:38.626 A:middle
smoother of a process.

00:46:39.416 --> 00:46:41.706 A:middle
So, like I said, we'll have to

00:46:41.706 --> 00:46:42.066 A:middle
see.

00:46:42.236 --> 00:46:43.416 A:middle
We're going to keep looking at

00:46:43.416 --> 00:46:44.536 A:middle
things and iterating.

00:46:44.906 --> 00:46:46.866 A:middle
It's funny because even when we

00:46:46.866 --> 00:46:49.266 A:middle
were planning this session, Doug

00:46:49.716 --> 00:46:51.276 A:middle
and I, we were texting back and

00:46:51.276 --> 00:46:52.676 A:middle
forth, and we were saying, you

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:54.806 A:middle
know, do we actually need the

00:46:54.806 --> 00:46:55.976 A:middle
favorites for tomorrow.

00:46:55.976 --> 00:46:57.546 A:middle
Does that really make sense?

00:46:57.666 --> 00:46:59.256 A:middle
And we have kind of gone back

00:46:59.256 --> 00:47:00.796 A:middle
and forth on it of like how

00:47:00.796 --> 00:47:01.926 A:middle
valuable that would be.

00:47:01.926 --> 00:47:02.976 A:middle
Or if it should be like a

00:47:02.976 --> 00:47:05.106 A:middle
rolling 24-hour window or

00:47:05.106 --> 00:47:05.976 A:middle
something like that.

00:47:05.976 --> 00:47:08.226 A:middle
I mean we're still continuing to

00:47:08.256 --> 00:47:09.576 A:middle
iterate, just like you do on

00:47:09.576 --> 00:47:10.216 A:middle
your apps.

00:47:10.706 --> 00:47:12.866 A:middle
So, you know, we'll see where we

00:47:12.866 --> 00:47:14.116 A:middle
land for next year.

00:47:15.946 --> 00:47:18.286 A:middle
Now, we went version by version,

00:47:18.336 --> 00:47:19.816 A:middle
but there are somethings that

00:47:19.816 --> 00:47:22.046 A:middle
are evergreen on Apple Watch.

00:47:23.316 --> 00:47:25.086 A:middle
Take for instance, notification.

00:47:25.616 --> 00:47:27.626 A:middle
Notifications are one of the

00:47:27.626 --> 00:47:30.486 A:middle
greatest pieces of Apple Watch.

00:47:30.486 --> 00:47:32.146 A:middle
I mean definitely for me when

00:47:32.146 --> 00:47:33.956 A:middle
people ask me why I love Apple

00:47:33.956 --> 00:47:35.716 A:middle
Watch so much, that's usually

00:47:35.716 --> 00:47:37.706 A:middle
the one thing that I rave about.

00:47:37.956 --> 00:47:39.396 A:middle
It's like you get these

00:47:39.396 --> 00:47:41.646 A:middle
notifications, and they're

00:47:41.646 --> 00:47:43.216 A:middle
information coming to you.

00:47:43.216 --> 00:47:44.306 A:middle
It's personal.

00:47:44.616 --> 00:47:45.796 A:middle
It's relevant.

00:47:45.886 --> 00:47:46.896 A:middle
It's contextual.

00:47:47.186 --> 00:47:48.066 A:middle
It's amazing.

00:47:49.076 --> 00:47:51.916 A:middle
So, we have notifications like

00:47:51.976 --> 00:47:52.326 A:middle
these.

00:47:52.326 --> 00:47:54.066 A:middle
Take for instance CARROT weather

00:47:54.066 --> 00:47:54.926 A:middle
in the US.

00:47:55.556 --> 00:47:57.626 A:middle
I set up in the app to get

00:47:57.916 --> 00:47:59.956 A:middle
tomorrow's forecast every night

00:47:59.956 --> 00:48:01.036 A:middle
at 9 PM.

00:48:01.496 --> 00:48:03.616 A:middle
And what I get is the app sends

00:48:03.616 --> 00:48:05.206 A:middle
a notification based on my

00:48:05.206 --> 00:48:07.256 A:middle
location and it takes over the

00:48:07.256 --> 00:48:10.156 A:middle
screen and shows me in a very

00:48:10.326 --> 00:48:12.846 A:middle
beautiful format the high, the

00:48:12.846 --> 00:48:15.086 A:middle
low, possible precipitation for

00:48:15.086 --> 00:48:15.676 A:middle
tomorrow.

00:48:15.916 --> 00:48:17.786 A:middle
And all I have to do is glance

00:48:17.786 --> 00:48:19.596 A:middle
at that, and then I know when I

00:48:19.596 --> 00:48:21.066 A:middle
wake up the next morning how I

00:48:21.066 --> 00:48:21.776 A:middle
need to dress.

00:48:21.776 --> 00:48:23.046 A:middle
How I need to prepare for my

00:48:23.046 --> 00:48:23.376 A:middle
day.

00:48:23.586 --> 00:48:24.886 A:middle
This is just coming to me.

00:48:25.176 --> 00:48:26.656 A:middle
It's wonderful.

00:48:27.636 --> 00:48:29.816 A:middle
Now, a lot of notifications that

00:48:29.816 --> 00:48:31.986 A:middle
I get, they look like this.

00:48:32.426 --> 00:48:35.326 A:middle
This is the default.

00:48:36.036 --> 00:48:37.386 A:middle
Now the default looks nice and

00:48:37.386 --> 00:48:39.866 A:middle
all but also look at this text.

00:48:40.196 --> 00:48:41.646 A:middle
It says check out the latest

00:48:41.646 --> 00:48:42.356 A:middle
news update.

00:48:42.946 --> 00:48:44.336 A:middle
Well, that's not very helpful.

00:48:44.526 --> 00:48:45.976 A:middle
Now I have to go to the app and

00:48:46.246 --> 00:48:47.436 A:middle
check out the news update.

00:48:47.696 --> 00:48:49.676 A:middle
OK is it relevant to me, I don't

00:48:49.676 --> 00:48:50.086 A:middle
know.

00:48:50.086 --> 00:48:53.466 A:middle
I guess. But with only about

00:48:53.466 --> 00:48:55.976 A:middle
four minutes worth of work, what

00:48:55.976 --> 00:48:57.456 A:middle
you can do is you can open your

00:48:57.456 --> 00:48:59.266 A:middle
storyboard in your project.

00:48:59.556 --> 00:49:01.946 A:middle
You can use the colors of your

00:49:02.466 --> 00:49:03.656 A:middle
app and apply those.

00:49:04.176 --> 00:49:06.236 A:middle
And you can apply them like this

00:49:06.536 --> 00:49:09.456 A:middle
to your apps name, to the sash,

00:49:10.196 --> 00:49:11.246 A:middle
to the background.

00:49:11.416 --> 00:49:14.056 A:middle
You can use spacing, textiles.

00:49:14.366 --> 00:49:15.626 A:middle
Make it more legible.

00:49:15.716 --> 00:49:16.746 A:middle
Make it more visually

00:49:16.746 --> 00:49:17.546 A:middle
interesting.

00:49:18.126 --> 00:49:19.286 A:middle
You'll also notice here that

00:49:19.286 --> 00:49:20.276 A:middle
there's more text.

00:49:20.276 --> 00:49:21.466 A:middle
So that right when I get the

00:49:21.466 --> 00:49:24.006 A:middle
notification, I know what it's

00:49:24.006 --> 00:49:24.536 A:middle
about.

00:49:25.246 --> 00:49:27.816 A:middle
Now, pay attention here, because

00:49:27.816 --> 00:49:29.806 A:middle
this text for the notification

00:49:30.006 --> 00:49:31.736 A:middle
is actually custom written for

00:49:31.736 --> 00:49:32.836 A:middle
the notifications.

00:49:33.126 --> 00:49:34.326 A:middle
Just for the notification

00:49:34.326 --> 00:49:34.856 A:middle
payload.

00:49:35.276 --> 00:49:37.056 A:middle
Now, the news in the app could

00:49:37.056 --> 00:49:38.936 A:middle
be longer, include more detail.

00:49:39.106 --> 00:49:40.096 A:middle
But this is the gist.

00:49:40.456 --> 00:49:42.306 A:middle
This is the important piece of

00:49:42.306 --> 00:49:43.686 A:middle
relevant information that we

00:49:43.686 --> 00:49:44.856 A:middle
want you to see.

00:49:46.126 --> 00:49:46.886 A:middle
Four minutes.

00:49:47.336 --> 00:49:48.066 A:middle
I'm telling you.

00:49:49.266 --> 00:49:51.216 A:middle
If we work our way backwards, we

00:49:51.216 --> 00:49:52.396 A:middle
can see the short look

00:49:52.396 --> 00:49:53.306 A:middle
notification.

00:49:53.406 --> 00:49:55.366 A:middle
Now, this is what displays on

00:49:55.366 --> 00:49:57.036 A:middle
Apple Watch, right when you feel

00:49:57.036 --> 00:49:58.376 A:middle
that haptic and raise your

00:49:58.376 --> 00:49:59.656 A:middle
wrist, when a notification

00:49:59.656 --> 00:50:00.286 A:middle
arrives.

00:50:00.916 --> 00:50:02.656 A:middle
It has your app icon, bit and

00:50:02.656 --> 00:50:02.976 A:middle
beautiful.

00:50:03.046 --> 00:50:04.946 A:middle
And it has your app name.

00:50:05.416 --> 00:50:06.926 A:middle
Now, notice the app name is in

00:50:06.926 --> 00:50:07.176 A:middle
white.

00:50:08.306 --> 00:50:10.146 A:middle
Again, this is the default.

00:50:10.486 --> 00:50:12.996 A:middle
But with one line of code in

00:50:12.996 --> 00:50:15.056 A:middle
your payload, you can use the

00:50:15.056 --> 00:50:17.566 A:middle
title key value pair and what

00:50:17.566 --> 00:50:19.396 A:middle
this allows you to do is provide

00:50:19.396 --> 00:50:21.146 A:middle
some more context as to what

00:50:21.146 --> 00:50:23.296 A:middle
this notification is about.

00:50:24.206 --> 00:50:26.106 A:middle
And so, what happens is this is

00:50:26.106 --> 00:50:27.166 A:middle
what it will look like.

00:50:27.376 --> 00:50:28.716 A:middle
When it arrives on your wrist,

00:50:28.716 --> 00:50:30.246 A:middle
it will have your beautiful

00:50:30.246 --> 00:50:33.176 A:middle
icon, but it will also have that

00:50:33.276 --> 00:50:35.446 A:middle
title string between the icon

00:50:35.546 --> 00:50:36.606 A:middle
and your app's name.

00:50:37.206 --> 00:50:39.836 A:middle
And so, immediately, I can see

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:40.956 A:middle
is this relevant to my

00:50:40.956 --> 00:50:41.776 A:middle
interests.

00:50:41.986 --> 00:50:43.596 A:middle
Can I look at this later?

00:50:43.696 --> 00:50:45.186 A:middle
Maybe I'm playing with my kids,

00:50:45.186 --> 00:50:46.816 A:middle
or I'm in a meeting, right?

00:50:47.566 --> 00:50:48.786 A:middle
And the other thing that you'll

00:50:48.786 --> 00:50:50.886 A:middle
notice is that the app name is

00:50:50.886 --> 00:50:52.836 A:middle
in the primary tint color for

00:50:52.836 --> 00:50:53.386 A:middle
the app.

00:50:53.776 --> 00:50:56.086 A:middle
So, it takes on more visual

00:50:56.306 --> 00:50:59.566 A:middle
sensibilities of your app.

00:50:59.806 --> 00:51:02.786 A:middle
So, truly four minutes and one

00:51:02.786 --> 00:51:05.046 A:middle
line of additional text, can

00:51:05.046 --> 00:51:06.536 A:middle
take you from default

00:51:06.536 --> 00:51:09.776 A:middle
notifications, to much more

00:51:10.466 --> 00:51:13.166 A:middle
relevant, contextual, visually

00:51:13.166 --> 00:51:15.016 A:middle
interesting notifications.

00:51:16.926 --> 00:51:19.646 A:middle
OK, so we've spoken about a lot

00:51:19.646 --> 00:51:22.206 A:middle
today and planning is key.

00:51:22.806 --> 00:51:24.476 A:middle
Really think about that process

00:51:24.476 --> 00:51:26.376 A:middle
of planning and designing your

00:51:26.376 --> 00:51:27.206 A:middle
Watch apps.

00:51:27.556 --> 00:51:29.616 A:middle
I'm telling you this process

00:51:29.616 --> 00:51:31.666 A:middle
should actually be the majority

00:51:31.956 --> 00:51:34.386 A:middle
of the entire development cycle

00:51:34.386 --> 00:51:35.386 A:middle
for your Watch app.

00:51:35.746 --> 00:51:37.876 A:middle
The implementation will be a lot

00:51:37.876 --> 00:51:39.416 A:middle
smaller timeframe.

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:41.386 A:middle
Then all the planning and design

00:51:41.386 --> 00:51:42.536 A:middle
to really make a great

00:51:42.536 --> 00:51:43.336 A:middle
experience.

00:51:44.696 --> 00:51:47.036 A:middle
Also. try to start simple.

00:51:47.276 --> 00:51:48.996 A:middle
You can see, even we made that

00:51:48.996 --> 00:51:49.566 A:middle
mistake.

00:51:49.726 --> 00:51:50.836 A:middle
We thought we were starting

00:51:50.836 --> 00:51:53.206 A:middle
simple, but we still had more

00:51:53.206 --> 00:51:54.756 A:middle
that we could do to make it

00:51:54.756 --> 00:51:56.226 A:middle
concise, to make it more

00:51:56.226 --> 00:51:56.906 A:middle
personal.

00:51:57.186 --> 00:51:58.286 A:middle
Think about that in your own

00:51:59.226 --> 00:51:59.366 A:middle
apps.

00:52:00.236 --> 00:52:03.516 A:middle
Finally, iterate, refine.

00:52:03.896 --> 00:52:06.506 A:middle
When the OS moves up to another

00:52:06.506 --> 00:52:08.616 A:middle
version, take advantage of what

00:52:08.616 --> 00:52:10.616 A:middle
you can, but don't feel like you

00:52:10.616 --> 00:52:12.576 A:middle
need to completely reinvent your

00:52:12.576 --> 00:52:14.696 A:middle
app just because it's the next

00:52:14.696 --> 00:52:15.296 A:middle
version.

00:52:17.886 --> 00:52:20.136 A:middle
For more information please

00:52:20.136 --> 00:52:21.116 A:middle
check out this link.

00:52:21.116 --> 00:52:22.556 A:middle
We've got links to our

00:52:22.556 --> 00:52:24.236 A:middle
resources, the watchOS human

00:52:24.236 --> 00:52:26.176 A:middle
interface guidelines and much

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:26.556 A:middle
more.

00:52:27.566 --> 00:52:28.576 A:middle
There are also some related

00:52:28.576 --> 00:52:30.036 A:middle
sessions you should definitely

00:52:30.036 --> 00:52:31.826 A:middle
check out if you haven't, such

00:52:31.826 --> 00:52:33.426 A:middle
as "What's New in watchOS," you

00:52:33.426 --> 00:52:34.696 A:middle
can see what you can take

00:52:34.696 --> 00:52:36.526 A:middle
advantage of in watchOS 4.

00:52:37.296 --> 00:52:39.126 A:middle
With that, thank you very much.

00:52:40.516 --> 00:52:44.500 A:middle
