[ Applause ]

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:25.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:27.876 A:middle
Welcome to Session 304, What's

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:28.916 A:middle
New in Device Management.

00:00:29.316 --> 00:00:30.996 A:middle
I'm Todd Fernandez and I'm very

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:32.356 A:middle
pleased to be your host on this

00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:33.846 A:middle
tour through new developments

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:35.326 A:middle
and how Apple devices can be

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.796 A:middle
managed in schools and

00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:38.426 A:middle
businesses around the world.

00:00:41.176 --> 00:00:42.626 A:middle
I just love this photo.

00:00:43.036 --> 00:00:45.586 A:middle
As Tim said on Monday, iPad has

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:47.806 A:middle
changed the way we teach, learn

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:50.096 A:middle
and create, which is why we work

00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:52.276 A:middle
so hard to make it easy to bring

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.936 A:middle
Apple devices into schools so

00:00:54.936 --> 00:00:56.456 A:middle
that students like these girls

00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:58.266 A:middle
can do amazing things with their

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.546 A:middle
iPads or Macs as the case may be

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.546 A:middle
iPads or Macs as the case may be

00:01:00.606 --> 00:01:02.616 A:middle
and get excited about learning

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:03.516 A:middle
and creating.

00:01:05.706 --> 00:01:07.186 A:middle
We also want to unlock new

00:01:07.186 --> 00:01:09.366 A:middle
solutions in enterprise to help

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.956 A:middle
employees be more productive and

00:01:11.396 --> 00:01:13.156 A:middle
enable businesses to create new

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.966 A:middle
ways of serving their customers

00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:17.046 A:middle
by providing experiences in

00:01:17.046 --> 00:01:19.096 A:middle
their hotels, restaurants and

00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:20.636 A:middle
hospitals that were not

00:01:20.636 --> 00:01:21.596 A:middle
previously possible.

00:01:23.486 --> 00:01:25.486 A:middle
Last year, we introduced three

00:01:25.486 --> 00:01:26.706 A:middle
huge new device management

00:01:26.706 --> 00:01:28.336 A:middle
features to support iPad

00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:29.536 A:middle
deployments in schools.

00:01:30.946 --> 00:01:33.036 A:middle
Classroom, an assistant which

00:01:33.036 --> 00:01:34.916 A:middle
helps teachers focus on teaching

00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:36.446 A:middle
rather than managing student

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:37.096 A:middle
devices.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.486 A:middle
Shared iPad, a great way to

00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:42.716 A:middle
provide a personalized

00:01:42.716 --> 00:01:44.726 A:middle
experience on an iPad shared by

00:01:44.726 --> 00:01:46.666 A:middle
many students each day in the

00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:47.286 A:middle
classroom.

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:50.666 A:middle
And last but not least, Apple

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.736 A:middle
School Manager, one place for

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:54.336 A:middle
school IT administrators to

00:01:54.336 --> 00:01:56.106 A:middle
create and manage all of their

00:01:56.106 --> 00:01:58.226 A:middle
schools' accounts, devices and

00:01:58.226 --> 00:01:58.706 A:middle
content.

00:02:00.836 --> 00:02:04.486 A:middle
Just like 2016, 2017 has already

00:02:04.486 --> 00:02:06.036 A:middle
been another big year for device

00:02:06.036 --> 00:02:07.746 A:middle
management as our releases

00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:09.806 A:middle
earlier this spring continued to

00:02:09.806 --> 00:02:11.736 A:middle
address the most important needs

00:02:11.946 --> 00:02:13.466 A:middle
in education and enterprise.

00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:16.336 A:middle
Introducing many more

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.106 A:middle
capabilities to management via

00:02:18.106 --> 00:02:19.866 A:middle
MDM and configuration profiles.

00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:23.626 A:middle
Connecting Apple TV fully into

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:27.006 A:middle
device management and conversely

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:28.086 A:middle
removing the management

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:29.826 A:middle
requirement for classroom by

00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:31.296 A:middle
empowering teachers to create

00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:33.046 A:middle
their own classes bringing

00:02:33.046 --> 00:02:34.496 A:middle
Classroom to a much wider

00:02:34.496 --> 00:02:36.276 A:middle
audience, including enabling

00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:37.436 A:middle
schools with bring your own

00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:39.056 A:middle
device programs around the

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:40.686 A:middle
world, good day Australia, can

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:42.536 A:middle
take advantage of Classroom.

00:02:43.416 --> 00:02:44.626 A:middle
But of course, we didn't stop

00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:44.916 A:middle
there.

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:46.986 A:middle
Today we'll announce a number of

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:48.636 A:middle
additional capabilities in each

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:50.536 A:middle
of these areas to enable people

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:52.296 A:middle
to make use of Apple devices in

00:02:52.296 --> 00:02:53.486 A:middle
new and exciting ways.

00:02:53.486 --> 00:02:54.816 A:middle
I don't want to spoil the

00:02:54.816 --> 00:02:56.766 A:middle
surprises so we'll cover each as

00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:57.916 A:middle
it comes up during today's

00:02:57.916 --> 00:02:58.316 A:middle
session.

00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:02.186 A:middle
As has become tradition, today's

00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:02.186 A:middle
As has become tradition, today's

00:03:02.186 --> 00:03:03.476 A:middle
session will follow deployment

00:03:03.476 --> 00:03:04.926 A:middle
lifecycle, beginning with

00:03:04.926 --> 00:03:06.416 A:middle
enrollment, getting your devices

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:07.476 A:middle
ready to be managed.

00:03:07.966 --> 00:03:09.346 A:middle
Continuing with distribution,

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:10.676 A:middle
loading those devices with

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:11.996 A:middle
compelling apps and content.

00:03:12.636 --> 00:03:14.216 A:middle
Management, performing the

00:03:14.216 --> 00:03:15.726 A:middle
ongoing day-to-day management of

00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:16.736 A:middle
all of your devices.

00:03:17.256 --> 00:03:18.636 A:middle
And finally, I'll give a brief

00:03:18.636 --> 00:03:20.516 A:middle
update on Apple's tools for both

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:22.486 A:middle
administrators and our MDM

00:03:22.486 --> 00:03:24.016 A:middle
solution partners which take

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:25.406 A:middle
advantage of all of these new

00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:25.996 A:middle
features.

00:03:27.086 --> 00:03:28.666 A:middle
In a break from tradition, I

00:03:28.736 --> 00:03:30.116 A:middle
will mostly serve as an emcee

00:03:30.116 --> 00:03:31.296 A:middle
this year and leave the

00:03:31.296 --> 00:03:32.726 A:middle
presentation to the engineers

00:03:32.726 --> 00:03:34.426 A:middle
who have designed, built and

00:03:34.426 --> 00:03:35.546 A:middle
tested all of the new

00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:36.636 A:middle
capabilities we will cover

00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:37.006 A:middle
today.

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:39.136 A:middle
We have so much to share I've

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:40.626 A:middle
brought along a supporting cast

00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:41.946 A:middle
larger than the Game of Thrones,

00:03:42.426 --> 00:03:44.606 A:middle
well okay seven engineers, to

00:03:44.936 --> 00:03:45.936 A:middle
help me get through it all.

00:03:45.936 --> 00:03:47.326 A:middle
But I promise that we will

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:48.636 A:middle
conclude in less time than it

00:03:48.636 --> 00:03:49.546 A:middle
takes the Oscars.

00:03:50.306 --> 00:03:52.096 A:middle
So, without further ado, I'd

00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:53.486 A:middle
like to ask Bob Whiteman to come

00:03:53.486 --> 00:03:55.466 A:middle
on stage and get us started by

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:56.786 A:middle
telling you all about how we've

00:03:56.786 --> 00:03:58.076 A:middle
improved enrollment this year.

00:03:58.466 --> 00:03:58.756 A:middle
Bob.

00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:05.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Game of Thrones, will we make

00:04:05.986 --> 00:04:07.106 A:middle
it through the season, who

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:08.466 A:middle
knows.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.656 A:middle
I'm Bob Whiteman, one of the

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:12.606 A:middle
Apple engineers responsible for

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:13.536 A:middle
the new device management

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:14.516 A:middle
features you'll see today.

00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:16.856 A:middle
In this section, you'll find out

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:18.516 A:middle
about major additions to Apple

00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:20.966 A:middle
TV management, new features of

00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:22.196 A:middle
the Device Enrollment Program,

00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:24.836 A:middle
security enhancements of the MDM

00:04:24.836 --> 00:04:27.986 A:middle
protocol, best practices for MDM

00:04:27.986 --> 00:04:29.746 A:middle
administrators and MDM server

00:04:29.746 --> 00:04:31.996 A:middle
developers, and a major update

00:04:31.996 --> 00:04:33.016 A:middle
to Apple School Manager.

00:04:34.656 --> 00:04:36.326 A:middle
First of Apple TV.

00:04:36.996 --> 00:04:38.766 A:middle
I'm happy to say that Apple TV

00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:40.166 A:middle
can now participate in the

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:41.486 A:middle
Device Enrollment Program.

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:45.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:47.316 A:middle
Apple TV devices have all the

00:04:47.316 --> 00:04:49.086 A:middle
same features as iOS devices,

00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:50.756 A:middle
zero touch configuration,

00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:52.946 A:middle
streamline setup, and wireless

00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:53.596 A:middle
supervision.

00:04:54.236 --> 00:04:56.596 A:middle
You plug in power, an ethernet

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.426 A:middle
and the device is automatically

00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:00.226 A:middle
configured, you don't even need

00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:00.226 A:middle
configured, you don't even need

00:05:00.226 --> 00:05:01.466 A:middle
the remote.

00:05:03.216 --> 00:05:04.626 A:middle
There's also a change to the

00:05:04.626 --> 00:05:06.106 A:middle
supervision of Apple TVs,

00:05:06.526 --> 00:05:08.036 A:middle
previously all Apple TVs were

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:10.386 A:middle
treated as supervised now they

00:05:10.386 --> 00:05:12.116 A:middle
are unsupervised by default.

00:05:12.356 --> 00:05:14.466 A:middle
If you don't want the elevated

00:05:14.466 --> 00:05:16.136 A:middle
privileges of supervision you

00:05:16.136 --> 00:05:19.196 A:middle
don't need to claim them.

00:05:19.896 --> 00:05:21.256 A:middle
We've expanded the Device

00:05:21.256 --> 00:05:22.716 A:middle
Enrollment Program with a new

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:24.476 A:middle
way to introduce devices into

00:05:24.476 --> 00:05:25.146 A:middle
the program.

00:05:25.936 --> 00:05:27.966 A:middle
Previously, DEP only supported

00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:29.656 A:middle
devices that were purchased from

00:05:29.656 --> 00:05:30.826 A:middle
a supported sales channel.

00:05:31.616 --> 00:05:33.976 A:middle
Now you can also enroll your own

00:05:33.976 --> 00:05:36.616 A:middle
devices in DEP regardless of how

00:05:36.616 --> 00:05:37.426 A:middle
you purchased them.

00:05:38.106 --> 00:05:39.066 A:middle
This will particularly help

00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:40.566 A:middle
schools that received donated

00:05:40.566 --> 00:05:40.976 A:middle
devices.

00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:46.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:48.986 A:middle
Now this new enrollment method

00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:50.166 A:middle
differs in two ways.

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:52.046 A:middle
The first is that the device is

00:05:52.096 --> 00:05:53.786 A:middle
always supervised and MDM

00:05:53.826 --> 00:05:55.876 A:middle
management is always mandatory.

00:05:57.076 --> 00:05:58.986 A:middle
The second is a 30-day

00:05:59.596 --> 00:06:01.866 A:middle
provisional period, when you add

00:05:59.596 --> 00:06:01.866 A:middle
provisional period, when you add

00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:04.026 A:middle
a device to DEP it erases the

00:06:04.026 --> 00:06:04.616 A:middle
device.

00:06:05.326 --> 00:06:06.446 A:middle
Then the provisional period

00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:08.656 A:middle
starts when the device is

00:06:08.726 --> 00:06:10.116 A:middle
subsequently activated.

00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:12.356 A:middle
During the provisional period

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:13.966 A:middle
the lock screen and setup

00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:15.646 A:middle
assistant indicates the device

00:06:15.686 --> 00:06:17.996 A:middle
is provisionally enrolled and

00:06:18.156 --> 00:06:19.816 A:middle
the user can remove the device

00:06:19.876 --> 00:06:22.146 A:middle
from DEP and set up assistant or

00:06:22.146 --> 00:06:24.576 A:middle
settings, which also erases the

00:06:24.576 --> 00:06:25.236 A:middle
device.

00:06:26.016 --> 00:06:27.946 A:middle
But after the 30 days expire,

00:06:28.236 --> 00:06:29.876 A:middle
the user can no longer do so.

00:06:31.076 --> 00:06:32.746 A:middle
Both during and after the

00:06:32.746 --> 00:06:34.966 A:middle
provisional period all DEP

00:06:34.966 --> 00:06:36.286 A:middle
features are available,

00:06:36.286 --> 00:06:38.676 A:middle
including streamline setup and

00:06:38.676 --> 00:06:40.006 A:middle
mandatory MDM enrollment.

00:06:42.496 --> 00:06:44.026 A:middle
Now let's switch over to the

00:06:44.026 --> 00:06:46.146 A:middle
other DEP enrollment method.

00:06:46.686 --> 00:06:48.356 A:middle
When you add a device to DEP

00:06:48.636 --> 00:06:50.306 A:middle
while purchasing the device from

00:06:50.306 --> 00:06:52.466 A:middle
an approved sales channel, the

00:06:52.466 --> 00:06:53.666 A:middle
device does not need to be

00:06:53.666 --> 00:06:55.896 A:middle
supervised and MDM management

00:06:55.896 --> 00:06:57.736 A:middle
can be optional, which lets the

00:06:57.736 --> 00:06:59.686 A:middle
user opt out of MDM management.

00:07:00.206 --> 00:07:01.996 A:middle
But only a vanishingly small

00:07:01.996 --> 00:07:03.196 A:middle
number of devices are in this

00:07:03.196 --> 00:07:04.506 A:middle
state and it was always kind of

00:07:04.506 --> 00:07:07.196 A:middle
an odd fit for DEP so we're

00:07:07.196 --> 00:07:08.196 A:middle
deprecating these.

00:07:08.516 --> 00:07:10.256 A:middle
In the future, all DEP enrolled

00:07:10.256 --> 00:07:11.526 A:middle
devices will need to be

00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:13.546 A:middle
supervised and MDM enrollment

00:07:13.686 --> 00:07:14.576 A:middle
will be mandatory.

00:07:15.216 --> 00:07:18.866 A:middle
And here's a little

00:07:18.866 --> 00:07:20.306 A:middle
housekeeping, with each new

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:22.106 A:middle
release of iOS there are new

00:07:22.106 --> 00:07:23.536 A:middle
panes in the setup assistant.

00:07:23.856 --> 00:07:25.586 A:middle
DEP configuration allows you to

00:07:25.586 --> 00:07:27.776 A:middle
skip these panes, so these are

00:07:27.776 --> 00:07:29.046 A:middle
the new skip keys.

00:07:29.126 --> 00:07:30.166 A:middle
I won't go over each one of

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:32.376 A:middle
these, but let me mention that

00:07:32.636 --> 00:07:34.216 A:middle
the keyboard user's pane only

00:07:34.216 --> 00:07:37.286 A:middle
appears on devices which are

00:07:37.286 --> 00:07:39.216 A:middle
non-US English regions, such as

00:07:39.216 --> 00:07:39.906 A:middle
China and Japan.

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:45.186 A:middle
Moving on to some security

00:07:45.186 --> 00:07:45.926 A:middle
enhancements.

00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:48.666 A:middle
In iOS 10.3 we introduced

00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:50.286 A:middle
partial trust for manually

00:07:50.286 --> 00:07:51.826 A:middle
installed certificates and

00:07:51.826 --> 00:07:53.116 A:middle
certificate profiles.

00:07:53.776 --> 00:07:55.266 A:middle
When a certificate has partial

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:57.386 A:middle
trust, it is trusted for all

00:07:57.386 --> 00:07:58.966 A:middle
purposes except SSL.

00:08:00.006 --> 00:08:01.246 A:middle
When a certificate is installed

00:08:01.276 --> 00:08:03.276 A:middle
noninteractively via MDM or

00:08:03.276 --> 00:08:05.006 A:middle
Configurator the certificate is

00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:07.336 A:middle
given full trust, but if it's

00:08:07.336 --> 00:08:09.126 A:middle
installed manually the

00:08:09.126 --> 00:08:10.686 A:middle
certificate gets partial trust

00:08:10.686 --> 00:08:11.426 A:middle
at first.

00:08:11.756 --> 00:08:13.686 A:middle
The user can go to Settings,

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:15.576 A:middle
About, Certificate Trust

00:08:15.576 --> 00:08:17.446 A:middle
Settings and enable Full Trust

00:08:17.686 --> 00:08:19.126 A:middle
which gives an appropriate

00:08:19.126 --> 00:08:20.006 A:middle
additional warning.

00:08:20.726 --> 00:08:22.866 A:middle
Now this is a speedbump that

00:08:22.866 --> 00:08:24.976 A:middle
gets users to reconsider whether

00:08:24.976 --> 00:08:26.666 A:middle
they should trust whatever

00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:28.326 A:middle
certificate they have just been

00:08:28.326 --> 00:08:29.546 A:middle
asked to trust.

00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:31.966 A:middle
Often MDM enrollments require

00:08:31.966 --> 00:08:33.226 A:middle
trusting the MDM server

00:08:33.226 --> 00:08:33.836 A:middle
certificate.

00:08:34.626 --> 00:08:36.226 A:middle
To avoid complicating MDM

00:08:36.226 --> 00:08:39.696 A:middle
onboarding we put a small gap in

00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:40.405 A:middle
the speedbump.

00:08:40.696 --> 00:08:42.525 A:middle
If the certificate is manually

00:08:42.525 --> 00:08:45.316 A:middle
installed by a profile that also

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:47.416 A:middle
contains an MDM payload that

00:08:47.416 --> 00:08:49.316 A:middle
certificate is given full trust.

00:08:49.656 --> 00:08:51.526 A:middle
So, if your MDM deployment

00:08:51.706 --> 00:08:53.946 A:middle
requires trust, make sure you're

00:08:53.946 --> 00:08:55.626 A:middle
distributing the certificate in

00:08:55.626 --> 00:08:57.456 A:middle
the same profile as the MDM

00:08:57.456 --> 00:08:59.386 A:middle
enrollment payload to make sure

00:08:59.386 --> 00:09:02.366 A:middle
that you're driving your users

00:08:59.386 --> 00:09:02.366 A:middle
that you're driving your users

00:09:02.516 --> 00:09:03.396 A:middle
through that gap in the

00:09:03.396 --> 00:09:03.866 A:middle
speedbump.

00:09:08.046 --> 00:09:10.886 A:middle
In 2018, MDM will require your

00:09:10.986 --> 00:09:12.766 A:middle
server to support App Transport

00:09:12.766 --> 00:09:14.916 A:middle
Security or ATS.

00:09:15.316 --> 00:09:16.606 A:middle
This is a set of security

00:09:16.606 --> 00:09:18.246 A:middle
requirements for secure

00:09:18.246 --> 00:09:19.756 A:middle
communication introduced

00:09:19.756 --> 00:09:20.256 A:middle
previously.

00:09:21.106 --> 00:09:22.966 A:middle
ATS requires specific protocol

00:09:22.966 --> 00:09:24.716 A:middle
details and cryptographic

00:09:24.716 --> 00:09:26.226 A:middle
algorithms to harden secure

00:09:26.226 --> 00:09:27.126 A:middle
communications.

00:09:27.256 --> 00:09:30.366 A:middle
For now, MDM is exempted from

00:09:30.366 --> 00:09:32.396 A:middle
ATS, but this exemption will be

00:09:32.396 --> 00:09:34.016 A:middle
ending in 2018.

00:09:34.246 --> 00:09:36.086 A:middle
If your MDM server does not

00:09:36.186 --> 00:09:38.626 A:middle
currently meet ATS requirements

00:09:38.626 --> 00:09:40.006 A:middle
in the future the MDM client

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:41.826 A:middle
will refuse to communicate with

00:09:41.826 --> 00:09:41.896 A:middle
it.

00:09:42.546 --> 00:09:44.006 A:middle
But regardless of that, the time

00:09:44.006 --> 00:09:45.596 A:middle
to update your MDM server is

00:09:45.596 --> 00:09:45.916 A:middle
now.

00:09:46.266 --> 00:09:47.946 A:middle
After all, these changes are a

00:09:47.946 --> 00:09:49.576 A:middle
good idea for security, whether

00:09:49.576 --> 00:09:51.766 A:middle
or not the device requires them.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.916 A:middle
MDM enrollment involves a SCEP

00:09:57.916 --> 00:09:59.566 A:middle
server to generate the device

00:09:59.566 --> 00:09:59.966 A:middle
identity.

00:10:00.586 --> 00:10:02.156 A:middle
This involves negotiating the

00:10:02.156 --> 00:10:04.456 A:middle
cryptographic algorithms used

00:10:04.456 --> 00:10:05.646 A:middle
for encryption and hashing.

00:10:06.626 --> 00:10:07.876 A:middle
We've dropped support for the

00:10:08.036 --> 00:10:09.466 A:middle
outdated DES algorithm.

00:10:11.256 --> 00:10:12.996 A:middle
And make sure you SCEP server

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:14.776 A:middle
advertises its capabilities

00:10:14.776 --> 00:10:16.786 A:middle
properly in the CA Caps field.

00:10:17.106 --> 00:10:18.716 A:middle
A couple of MDM servers out

00:10:18.776 --> 00:10:21.086 A:middle
there didn't and that forced the

00:10:21.126 --> 00:10:22.846 A:middle
MDM client to fall back to the

00:10:22.846 --> 00:10:24.446 A:middle
lowest quality algorithm triple

00:10:24.446 --> 00:10:26.216 A:middle
DES even though the SCEP servers

00:10:26.216 --> 00:10:27.386 A:middle
in question supported better

00:10:27.386 --> 00:10:28.026 A:middle
algorithms.

00:10:28.876 --> 00:10:30.976 A:middle
And on that note, add support

00:10:30.976 --> 00:10:32.456 A:middle
for the best algorithms which

00:10:32.456 --> 00:10:33.876 A:middle
are currently AES for bulk

00:10:33.876 --> 00:10:35.616 A:middle
encryption and SHA-512 for

00:10:35.616 --> 00:10:35.966 A:middle
hashing.

00:10:36.676 --> 00:10:41.396 A:middle
On the macOS side, we've

00:10:41.396 --> 00:10:42.566 A:middle
hardened the server certificate

00:10:42.566 --> 00:10:44.466 A:middle
evaluation for MDM communication

00:10:44.466 --> 00:10:45.326 A:middle
in High Sierra.

00:10:46.266 --> 00:10:47.866 A:middle
This involves three new keys in

00:10:47.866 --> 00:10:49.236 A:middle
the MDM enrollment payload.

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:51.796 A:middle
The first two keys specify white

00:10:51.796 --> 00:10:53.476 A:middle
lists of certificates to use

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:55.606 A:middle
when evaluating server trust.

00:10:55.606 --> 00:10:57.816 A:middle
One set for the server URL and

00:10:57.816 --> 00:10:59.226 A:middle
the other for the checking URL.

00:11:00.556 --> 00:11:02.616 A:middle
The third key specifies hard or

00:11:02.616 --> 00:11:04.516 A:middle
soft revocation checking on

00:11:04.516 --> 00:11:05.966 A:middle
those pinned certificates.

00:11:06.476 --> 00:11:07.996 A:middle
Hard revocation checking means

00:11:07.996 --> 00:11:10.256 A:middle
that the trust evaluation fails

00:11:10.546 --> 00:11:12.086 A:middle
if the device cannot get a

00:11:12.086 --> 00:11:13.286 A:middle
positive response from the

00:11:13.286 --> 00:11:15.176 A:middle
revocation server for any

00:11:15.176 --> 00:11:15.536 A:middle
reason.

00:11:16.846 --> 00:11:18.256 A:middle
Now these are generally good

00:11:18.256 --> 00:11:19.596 A:middle
security features for securing

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.846 A:middle
communications, but if you're

00:11:21.896 --> 00:11:24.246 A:middle
only administrating Macs this

00:11:24.246 --> 00:11:26.556 A:middle
can be particularly useful it

00:11:26.676 --> 00:11:28.306 A:middle
can save you the cost and effort

00:11:28.306 --> 00:11:29.536 A:middle
of getting a certificate for a

00:11:29.536 --> 00:11:30.146 A:middle
public CA.

00:11:31.446 --> 00:11:33.046 A:middle
Just remember to be particularly

00:11:33.116 --> 00:11:34.506 A:middle
careful when rolling out these

00:11:34.506 --> 00:11:36.296 A:middle
features, especially pinning the

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:37.706 A:middle
server URL certificate.

00:11:38.196 --> 00:11:40.416 A:middle
A misconfiguration could cut off

00:11:40.416 --> 00:11:41.626 A:middle
your Macs from communicating

00:11:41.626 --> 00:11:43.246 A:middle
with your MDM server which makes

00:11:43.246 --> 00:11:44.576 A:middle
it very difficult to correct the

00:11:44.576 --> 00:11:45.476 A:middle
misconfiguration.

00:11:46.176 --> 00:11:50.366 A:middle
I'd like to share some best

00:11:50.366 --> 00:11:52.226 A:middle
practices for administrators.

00:11:53.416 --> 00:11:55.226 A:middle
For those administering Shared

00:11:55.226 --> 00:11:57.056 A:middle
iPad, please enable diagnostic

00:11:57.056 --> 00:11:58.866 A:middle
submission using the diagnostic

00:11:58.866 --> 00:11:59.766 A:middle
submission command.

00:12:00.276 --> 00:12:01.666 A:middle
This lets us collect the raw

00:12:01.666 --> 00:12:03.236 A:middle
data that we need in order to

00:12:03.236 --> 00:12:04.626 A:middle
help us improve the product for

00:12:04.626 --> 00:12:05.096 A:middle
everyone.

00:12:05.676 --> 00:12:09.576 A:middle
Also for Shared iPad there's an

00:12:09.576 --> 00:12:11.226 A:middle
interaction between the user

00:12:11.226 --> 00:12:13.766 A:middle
quota setting and the APFS file

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:14.206 A:middle
system.

00:12:14.866 --> 00:12:16.296 A:middle
A user quota controls two

00:12:16.296 --> 00:12:17.086 A:middle
different things.

00:12:17.366 --> 00:12:18.816 A:middle
It sets a maximum number of

00:12:18.816 --> 00:12:21.386 A:middle
users that can have data stored

00:12:21.386 --> 00:12:23.826 A:middle
on the device and it ensures

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.316 A:middle
that individual users aren't

00:12:25.316 --> 00:12:26.876 A:middle
consuming too much file system

00:12:26.876 --> 00:12:28.596 A:middle
space which would crowd out

00:12:28.596 --> 00:12:29.386 A:middle
other users.

00:12:30.306 --> 00:12:31.716 A:middle
If you already have Shared iPad

00:12:31.716 --> 00:12:33.886 A:middle
devices with the user quota that

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:36.306 A:middle
second control of storage space

00:12:36.376 --> 00:12:38.266 A:middle
is effectively disabled by the

00:12:38.266 --> 00:12:40.256 A:middle
upgrade that APFS introduced in

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:41.486 A:middle
iOS 10.3.

00:12:42.266 --> 00:12:43.176 A:middle
There's a one-time

00:12:43.176 --> 00:12:45.176 A:middle
administration task to restore

00:12:45.456 --> 00:12:46.226 A:middle
the storage quote.

00:12:47.516 --> 00:12:50.246 A:middle
Upgrade to the latest iOS and

00:12:50.246 --> 00:12:51.816 A:middle
wipe all of the existing user

00:12:51.816 --> 00:12:53.026 A:middle
counts on the iPad.

00:12:53.226 --> 00:12:54.426 A:middle
You can either erase the iPad

00:12:54.426 --> 00:12:56.566 A:middle
and set it up again or use the

00:12:56.566 --> 00:12:57.656 A:middle
delete user command.

00:12:58.446 --> 00:12:59.806 A:middle
And don't forget to shut down

00:12:59.806 --> 00:13:01.306 A:middle
the iPad after you're done so

00:12:59.806 --> 00:13:01.306 A:middle
the iPad after you're done so

00:13:01.306 --> 00:13:02.216 A:middle
that it's ready to go when the

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:02.976 A:middle
users first get it.

00:13:07.046 --> 00:13:08.276 A:middle
If you're using startup profiles

00:13:08.306 --> 00:13:10.126 A:middle
on macOS you've been putting the

00:13:10.126 --> 00:13:11.996 A:middle
profiles in a special location

00:13:11.996 --> 00:13:13.526 A:middle
in the file system this is now

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:14.326 A:middle
deprecated.

00:13:14.896 --> 00:13:16.526 A:middle
Instead, there's a new option to

00:13:16.526 --> 00:13:18.326 A:middle
the profiles command line tool

00:13:18.566 --> 00:13:19.816 A:middle
that lets you specify startup

00:13:19.876 --> 00:13:21.406 A:middle
profiles, the details are in the

00:13:21.406 --> 00:13:22.796 A:middle
main page for the profiles

00:13:22.796 --> 00:13:22.976 A:middle
command.

00:13:27.046 --> 00:13:28.286 A:middle
And now some best practices for

00:13:28.286 --> 00:13:28.976 A:middle
those of you that are

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:30.706 A:middle
implementing MDM servers.

00:13:31.196 --> 00:13:32.376 A:middle
I just mentioned how useful the

00:13:32.376 --> 00:13:34.176 A:middle
diagnostic submission command

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:35.776 A:middle
is, so please make sure that

00:13:35.776 --> 00:13:36.786 A:middle
your server supports it.

00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:42.786 A:middle
In 2018, APNs tokens will likely

00:13:42.786 --> 00:13:44.666 A:middle
increase in size, verify that

00:13:44.666 --> 00:13:46.496 A:middle
your server can handle APNs

00:13:46.496 --> 00:13:48.656 A:middle
tokens up to 100 bytes in size.

00:13:49.006 --> 00:13:50.596 A:middle
Don't just hardcode the size of

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:51.736 A:middle
APNs tokens that you've been

00:13:51.736 --> 00:13:52.946 A:middle
receiving from devices.

00:13:57.046 --> 00:13:58.536 A:middle
When the MDM server generates

00:13:58.676 --> 00:14:00.356 A:middle
its enrollment profile limit it

00:13:58.676 --> 00:14:00.356 A:middle
its enrollment profile limit it

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:02.436 A:middle
to just the MDM payload and

00:14:02.436 --> 00:14:04.226 A:middle
payloads necessary to ensure

00:14:04.226 --> 00:14:05.656 A:middle
that the enrollment succeeds,

00:14:05.806 --> 00:14:07.936 A:middle
such as Wi-Fi payload or

00:14:07.936 --> 00:14:08.946 A:middle
certificate payload.

00:14:09.446 --> 00:14:11.196 A:middle
Don't use this profile to

00:14:11.196 --> 00:14:12.736 A:middle
configure other things like

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.286 A:middle
restrictions or accounts,

00:14:14.526 --> 00:14:15.856 A:middle
instead push those payloads

00:14:15.916 --> 00:14:17.346 A:middle
after the enrollment completes.

00:14:17.976 --> 00:14:22.286 A:middle
And last, I'd like to challenge

00:14:22.416 --> 00:14:24.346 A:middle
MDM solution providers to make

00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:25.916 A:middle
the life of an administrator

00:14:26.026 --> 00:14:26.456 A:middle
easier.

00:14:26.926 --> 00:14:28.036 A:middle
Device management provides a

00:14:28.036 --> 00:14:29.866 A:middle
large number of individual

00:14:29.866 --> 00:14:31.866 A:middle
controls and we're adding more

00:14:31.866 --> 00:14:33.296 A:middle
with each new release.

00:14:33.676 --> 00:14:34.916 A:middle
This makes device management

00:14:35.056 --> 00:14:37.256 A:middle
powerful, but complex.

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:39.496 A:middle
Administrators may not know all

00:14:39.496 --> 00:14:40.566 A:middle
of the details of how these

00:14:40.566 --> 00:14:42.566 A:middle
controls interact and that

00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:43.476 A:middle
raises the risk of a

00:14:43.476 --> 00:14:44.386 A:middle
misconfiguration.

00:14:45.046 --> 00:14:47.346 A:middle
For instance, an administrator

00:14:47.346 --> 00:14:49.376 A:middle
may restrict the App Store to

00:14:49.376 --> 00:14:51.596 A:middle
prevent unauthorized apps, but

00:14:51.596 --> 00:14:52.686 A:middle
not realize that they should

00:14:52.776 --> 00:14:54.796 A:middle
also restrict pairings so that

00:14:54.796 --> 00:14:56.026 A:middle
apps can't be installed with

00:14:56.136 --> 00:14:57.536 A:middle
Configurator or iTunes.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.246 A:middle
So, do what you can in both

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.246 A:middle
So, do what you can in both

00:15:00.296 --> 00:15:02.966 A:middle
documentation and software to

00:15:02.966 --> 00:15:05.096 A:middle
meet administrator's needs, not

00:15:05.096 --> 00:15:05.976 A:middle
just allow them to set settings.

00:15:12.056 --> 00:15:12.756 A:middle
If you're troubleshooting device

00:15:12.756 --> 00:15:14.156 A:middle
management problems I have some

00:15:14.156 --> 00:15:15.046 A:middle
tips for that.

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:16.506 A:middle
Your best source of information

00:15:16.506 --> 00:15:17.616 A:middle
is the system logs.

00:15:17.976 --> 00:15:19.336 A:middle
You can view them with the macOS

00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:21.216 A:middle
apps Console or Apple

00:15:21.216 --> 00:15:22.046 A:middle
Configurator 2.

00:15:23.026 --> 00:15:25.266 A:middle
On iOS, filter the logs by

00:15:25.366 --> 00:15:27.136 A:middle
process name to hone in on the

00:15:27.136 --> 00:15:28.596 A:middle
most useful messages.

00:15:29.286 --> 00:15:31.376 A:middle
Profiling is responsible for

00:15:31.376 --> 00:15:32.426 A:middle
installation and removal of

00:15:32.466 --> 00:15:33.956 A:middle
profiles and restrictions and

00:15:33.956 --> 00:15:34.436 A:middle
other things.

00:15:35.426 --> 00:15:37.386 A:middle
MDM is responsible for

00:15:37.386 --> 00:15:38.726 A:middle
communicating with the MDM

00:15:38.726 --> 00:15:40.736 A:middle
server and tracking management

00:15:40.736 --> 00:15:42.916 A:middle
of apps, systems and accounts.

00:15:43.946 --> 00:15:45.016 A:middle
If you have a device that's not

00:15:45.016 --> 00:15:46.106 A:middle
communicating with the MDM

00:15:46.106 --> 00:15:50.336 A:middle
server you want to examine mdmd.

00:15:50.336 --> 00:15:52.696 A:middle
DMD relays management commands

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:53.996 A:middle
to other parts of the operating

00:15:53.996 --> 00:15:54.456 A:middle
system.

00:15:55.626 --> 00:15:57.556 A:middle
And appstored installs and

00:15:57.556 --> 00:16:00.346 A:middle
removes apps and if those apps

00:15:57.556 --> 00:16:00.346 A:middle
removes apps and if those apps

00:16:00.346 --> 00:16:02.456 A:middle
come from iTunes itunesstored is

00:16:02.456 --> 00:16:03.186 A:middle
involved as well.

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:05.226 A:middle
So, when you're looking through

00:16:05.226 --> 00:16:06.816 A:middle
the logs your best bet is to

00:16:06.816 --> 00:16:08.646 A:middle
look for log messages of error

00:16:08.646 --> 00:16:10.496 A:middle
type first and if nothing jumps

00:16:10.496 --> 00:16:12.136 A:middle
out at you look at the warning

00:16:12.136 --> 00:16:14.366 A:middle
level as well.

00:16:14.796 --> 00:16:17.376 A:middle
On macOS, don't filter the logs

00:16:17.446 --> 00:16:19.756 A:middle
by process instead, filter the

00:16:19.756 --> 00:16:21.266 A:middle
logs by setting the subsystem to

00:16:21.336 --> 00:16:24.416 A:middle
com.apple.ManagedClient which

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:25.606 A:middle
covers all appropriate

00:16:25.606 --> 00:16:26.306 A:middle
processes.

00:16:26.806 --> 00:16:28.496 A:middle
But for both operating systems

00:16:28.896 --> 00:16:30.466 A:middle
you may want to install a debug

00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:32.216 A:middle
logging profile to get more

00:16:32.216 --> 00:16:33.256 A:middle
detailed information.

00:16:33.666 --> 00:16:34.966 A:middle
Just remember the caveats

00:16:34.966 --> 00:16:36.296 A:middle
involved when using debug

00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:36.706 A:middle
logging.

00:16:36.806 --> 00:16:38.526 A:middle
For instance, don't habitually

00:16:38.596 --> 00:16:40.346 A:middle
push the logging profiles to all

00:16:40.346 --> 00:16:41.706 A:middle
the devices in your population.

00:16:42.696 --> 00:16:43.866 A:middle
If you have any troubleshooting

00:16:43.866 --> 00:16:45.806 A:middle
questions make sure to come to

00:16:45.806 --> 00:16:46.646 A:middle
the lab sessions.

00:16:47.776 --> 00:16:48.786 A:middle
And now I'm going to turn it

00:16:48.786 --> 00:16:50.996 A:middle
over to my colleagues, Can Aran

00:16:50.996 --> 00:16:52.616 A:middle
and Juan [inaudible] to demo

00:16:52.616 --> 00:16:54.346 A:middle
some of these.

00:16:55.746 --> 00:16:56.436 A:middle
Can.

00:16:57.516 --> 00:17:00.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:16:57.516 --> 00:17:00.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:05.276 --> 00:17:06.675 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, I'm Can Aran, iOS

00:17:06.675 --> 00:17:07.675 A:middle
engineer in the device

00:17:07.675 --> 00:17:10.455 A:middle
management team and I must say

00:17:10.455 --> 00:17:12.016 A:middle
I'm very excited to be here.

00:17:13.476 --> 00:17:15.136 A:middle
I will be using Configurator,

00:17:15.136 --> 00:17:17.215 A:middle
Apple Configurator 2 to enroll

00:17:17.215 --> 00:17:20.126 A:middle
this device and let's get

00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:22.786 A:middle
started with that.

00:17:22.786 --> 00:17:23.915 A:middle
I'll choose the device,

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:27.195 A:middle
right-click on it and hit

00:17:27.195 --> 00:17:28.205 A:middle
Prepare.

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:30.456 A:middle
In the new version of

00:17:30.456 --> 00:17:32.216 A:middle
Configurator, we have this

00:17:32.216 --> 00:17:34.246 A:middle
option to add the device to

00:17:34.246 --> 00:17:36.216 A:middle
Device Enrollment Program, so

00:17:36.216 --> 00:17:38.586 A:middle
we'll check that and hit Next.

00:17:39.636 --> 00:17:41.596 A:middle
Just a quick note, I had already

00:17:41.596 --> 00:17:44.366 A:middle
logged in to my DP Organization

00:17:44.566 --> 00:17:46.056 A:middle
Configurator prompted me for

00:17:46.056 --> 00:17:48.586 A:middle
that and saved my credentials.

00:17:49.716 --> 00:17:51.806 A:middle
Here we can specify our MDM

00:17:51.806 --> 00:17:54.926 A:middle
server, we can enter our

00:17:54.926 --> 00:17:59.926 A:middle
organization information, and we

00:17:59.926 --> 00:18:01.466 A:middle
can skip these steps in Setup

00:17:59.926 --> 00:18:01.466 A:middle
can skip these steps in Setup

00:18:01.466 --> 00:18:05.406 A:middle
Assistant and we will need to

00:18:05.406 --> 00:18:08.316 A:middle
provide a Wi-Fi profile for the

00:18:08.316 --> 00:18:09.926 A:middle
device to be able to communicate

00:18:09.926 --> 00:18:10.536 A:middle
with the server.

00:18:13.476 --> 00:18:16.096 A:middle
And we may enter our credentials

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.966 A:middle
for the MDM server, but we do

00:18:17.966 --> 00:18:19.076 A:middle
not need to for now.

00:18:20.326 --> 00:18:22.926 A:middle
So, once I hit Prepare here

00:18:22.926 --> 00:18:25.646 A:middle
device will get added to DEP and

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:27.816 A:middle
after that it will erase itself

00:18:28.136 --> 00:18:29.566 A:middle
which will take some time to

00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:31.106 A:middle
land on Setup Assistant.

00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:34.176 A:middle
So, for the sake of our time

00:18:34.476 --> 00:18:38.146 A:middle
we'll use another device to go

00:18:38.146 --> 00:18:39.276 A:middle
through Setup Assistant.

00:18:39.576 --> 00:18:41.406 A:middle
This device is already added to

00:18:41.406 --> 00:18:42.766 A:middle
DEP beforehand.

00:18:45.076 --> 00:18:48.666 A:middle
So, let's hit Prepare and switch

00:18:48.666 --> 00:18:49.966 A:middle
to the other device.

00:19:00.236 --> 00:19:00.556 A:middle
All right.

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.506 A:middle
So, we have a new pane for

00:19:02.506 --> 00:19:04.136 A:middle
Device Enrollment now it's

00:19:04.136 --> 00:19:06.616 A:middle
called Remote Management, can

00:19:06.616 --> 00:19:07.986 A:middle
see the details about what

00:19:07.986 --> 00:19:10.336 A:middle
Remote Management does here and

00:19:10.446 --> 00:19:13.266 A:middle
also, we can remove the device

00:19:13.386 --> 00:19:15.816 A:middle
from DEP by just clicking on

00:19:15.816 --> 00:19:17.316 A:middle
Leave Remote Management button.

00:19:18.536 --> 00:19:20.746 A:middle
This button will appear in the

00:19:20.746 --> 00:19:23.396 A:middle
first 30 days of enrollments as

00:19:23.396 --> 00:19:24.686 A:middle
my colleague Bob said.

00:19:24.896 --> 00:19:26.846 A:middle
Once we hit that it will remove

00:19:26.846 --> 00:19:30.786 A:middle
the device from DEP.

00:19:37.156 --> 00:19:40.706 A:middle
Also, this button is there

00:19:40.706 --> 00:19:42.586 A:middle
because we would like to protect

00:19:42.586 --> 00:19:45.916 A:middle
our users, we don't want our

00:19:45.916 --> 00:19:47.816 A:middle
users' devices to get added to

00:19:47.816 --> 00:19:50.186 A:middle
DEP without their consent or

00:19:50.186 --> 00:19:50.916 A:middle
accidentally.

00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:54.036 A:middle
So, let's apply the

00:19:54.036 --> 00:19:57.866 A:middle
configuration by hitting Next

00:19:57.866 --> 00:20:00.196 A:middle
and let's enter our secret

00:19:57.866 --> 00:20:00.196 A:middle
and let's enter our secret

00:20:01.196 --> 00:20:02.976 A:middle
credentials for the MDM server.

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.356 A:middle
And let's read the terms and

00:20:14.356 --> 00:20:16.436 A:middle
conditions as I know every one

00:20:16.436 --> 00:20:16.976 A:middle
of you do.

00:20:23.046 --> 00:20:25.106 A:middle
And that's it device has the

00:20:25.106 --> 00:20:26.556 A:middle
configuration that has been

00:20:26.556 --> 00:20:29.126 A:middle
specified by the MDM server and

00:20:29.126 --> 00:20:32.416 A:middle
it's been added to DEP just as

00:20:32.416 --> 00:20:34.406 A:middle
if it was purchased from a

00:20:34.406 --> 00:20:35.716 A:middle
supported sales channel.

00:20:36.666 --> 00:20:39.056 A:middle
So regardless of how the device

00:20:39.056 --> 00:20:42.606 A:middle
is purchased it can be added to

00:20:43.216 --> 00:20:43.716 A:middle
DEP now.

00:20:43.716 --> 00:20:44.806 A:middle
Now that I have enrolled my

00:20:44.806 --> 00:20:47.306 A:middle
device I would like to invite my

00:20:47.306 --> 00:20:49.056 A:middle
colleague Juan [inaudible] to

00:20:49.056 --> 00:20:51.146 A:middle
stage to show you how this

00:20:51.146 --> 00:20:52.906 A:middle
connects to Apple School Manager

00:20:52.906 --> 00:20:53.186 A:middle
world.

00:20:53.556 --> 00:20:53.876 A:middle
Thank you.

00:20:54.516 --> 00:20:58.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:03.046 --> 00:21:03.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Can.

00:21:04.446 --> 00:21:05.866 A:middle
Hi, my name is Juan [inaudible]

00:21:05.866 --> 00:21:08.206 A:middle
and I'm the UI Manager for Apple

00:21:08.206 --> 00:21:08.706 A:middle
School.

00:21:09.426 --> 00:21:10.936 A:middle
And today I'm really proud to

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.206 A:middle
show you the latest version that

00:21:13.206 --> 00:21:14.926 A:middle
came out of preview on May 17.

00:21:16.136 --> 00:21:17.046 A:middle
But for those that are not

00:21:17.046 --> 00:21:18.306 A:middle
familiar with Apple School what

00:21:18.306 --> 00:21:18.906 A:middle
is Apple School?

00:21:19.706 --> 00:21:21.046 A:middle
Apple School is your one

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:24.016 A:middle
destination for your institution

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:25.806 A:middle
to manage your devices,

00:21:26.186 --> 00:21:29.206 A:middle
accounts, and content.

00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:33.326 A:middle
So, these are some of the new

00:21:33.326 --> 00:21:34.856 A:middle
features that came out in the

00:21:34.856 --> 00:21:35.816 A:middle
latest release.

00:21:36.336 --> 00:21:37.956 A:middle
We have a new streamlined user

00:21:37.956 --> 00:21:41.566 A:middle
interface, the ability to create

00:21:41.566 --> 00:21:43.566 A:middle
up to five administrators and

00:21:43.566 --> 00:21:44.726 A:middle
support for PowerSchool.

00:21:45.376 --> 00:21:46.976 A:middle
But nothing better than a demo

00:21:47.696 --> 00:21:49.236 A:middle
to show you our new streamlined

00:21:49.236 --> 00:21:50.356 A:middle
user interface.

00:21:50.356 --> 00:21:52.986 A:middle
Today I'm going to be an

00:21:52.986 --> 00:21:55.576 A:middle
administrator at my organization

00:21:56.016 --> 00:21:59.706 A:middle
and I'm going to start talking

00:21:59.706 --> 00:22:02.636 A:middle
to you guys about managing

00:21:59.706 --> 00:22:02.636 A:middle
to you guys about managing

00:22:03.306 --> 00:22:03.786 A:middle
devices.

00:22:05.466 --> 00:22:08.016 A:middle
Can just enrolled two devices to

00:22:08.016 --> 00:22:10.336 A:middle
the DEP program and you can see

00:22:10.336 --> 00:22:12.066 A:middle
the two devices up here on

00:22:12.066 --> 00:22:13.296 A:middle
devices added by Apple

00:22:13.296 --> 00:22:14.166 A:middle
Configurator 2.

00:22:15.276 --> 00:22:18.026 A:middle
And we just realized that I

00:22:18.026 --> 00:22:19.546 A:middle
should have assigned one of

00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:21.756 A:middle
those devices to this MDM server

00:22:22.446 --> 00:22:24.356 A:middle
in a different location.

00:22:24.946 --> 00:22:27.766 A:middle
So, let's do that.

00:22:28.356 --> 00:22:31.486 A:middle
I'm going to search for my

00:22:31.486 --> 00:22:36.916 A:middle
device, here is the last iPad

00:22:36.916 --> 00:22:38.446 A:middle
that he added to the DEP

00:22:38.476 --> 00:22:38.826 A:middle
program.

00:22:39.256 --> 00:22:40.396 A:middle
And I'm just going to switch it

00:22:40.396 --> 00:22:41.906 A:middle
to Abraham Lincoln Elementary,

00:22:43.056 --> 00:22:45.316 A:middle
click Done and now I'm ready to

00:22:45.476 --> 00:22:47.546 A:middle
wipe that device and the next

00:22:47.546 --> 00:22:49.226 A:middle
time it boots up it's ready to

00:22:49.226 --> 00:22:51.376 A:middle
start to be managed by his new

00:22:51.376 --> 00:22:52.266 A:middle
MDM server.

00:22:52.266 --> 00:22:56.106 A:middle
Now let's talk about managing

00:22:56.106 --> 00:22:56.876 A:middle
your accounts.

00:22:57.436 --> 00:23:00.566 A:middle
So, imagine the following

00:22:57.436 --> 00:23:00.566 A:middle
So, imagine the following

00:23:00.566 --> 00:23:02.336 A:middle
scenario, it's the beginning of

00:23:02.336 --> 00:23:05.086 A:middle
the school year in at Abraham

00:23:05.086 --> 00:23:07.266 A:middle
Lincoln Elementary and we have a

00:23:07.326 --> 00:23:09.576 A:middle
new group of students, of

00:23:09.626 --> 00:23:10.346 A:middle
first-graders.

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:13.406 A:middle
So, we need to create new

00:23:13.406 --> 00:23:15.036 A:middle
credentials for these students.

00:23:16.736 --> 00:23:17.826 A:middle
So, let's do that.

00:23:18.056 --> 00:23:21.066 A:middle
I'm going to navigate to

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:23.526 A:middle
locations, here's my elementary

00:23:23.526 --> 00:23:26.436 A:middle
school, now I want to see the

00:23:26.436 --> 00:23:27.666 A:middle
accounts related to this school.

00:23:28.656 --> 00:23:30.946 A:middle
Notice that my filtering UI is

00:23:30.946 --> 00:23:31.576 A:middle
now visible.

00:23:32.086 --> 00:23:34.846 A:middle
Now I just need to add a couple

00:23:34.846 --> 00:23:40.026 A:middle
filters, I want my students and

00:23:40.076 --> 00:23:40.976 A:middle
my first-graders.

00:23:41.506 --> 00:23:45.476 A:middle
As you can tell, I've been

00:23:45.476 --> 00:23:47.336 A:middle
changing -- the search results

00:23:47.336 --> 00:23:49.146 A:middle
have changed and there's this

00:23:49.146 --> 00:23:50.366 A:middle
first row that allows me to

00:23:50.366 --> 00:23:52.206 A:middle
select all the students in this

00:23:52.206 --> 00:23:52.526 A:middle
filter.

00:23:53.026 --> 00:23:57.116 A:middle
On your right, you can see

00:23:57.276 --> 00:23:58.916 A:middle
several different bulk actions

00:23:58.916 --> 00:24:00.486 A:middle
that I can execute as an

00:23:58.916 --> 00:24:00.486 A:middle
that I can execute as an

00:24:00.486 --> 00:24:01.036 A:middle
administrator.

00:24:02.856 --> 00:24:05.086 A:middle
Now let's create a sign-in sheet

00:24:05.296 --> 00:24:06.056 A:middle
for these students.

00:24:06.496 --> 00:24:08.036 A:middle
You might be wondering why a

00:24:08.036 --> 00:24:09.906 A:middle
sign-in sheet, well it turns out

00:24:09.906 --> 00:24:11.256 A:middle
that most first-graders don't

00:24:11.256 --> 00:24:12.646 A:middle
have a phone number or an e-mail

00:24:12.646 --> 00:24:15.656 A:middle
address so we need this

00:24:15.656 --> 00:24:17.516 A:middle
alternative method to distribute

00:24:17.516 --> 00:24:18.066 A:middle
the credentials.

00:24:19.096 --> 00:24:19.666 A:middle
So, let's do that.

00:24:20.086 --> 00:24:22.376 A:middle
All right, I select Create, a

00:24:22.376 --> 00:24:25.716 A:middle
create a downloadable PDF and

00:24:27.156 --> 00:24:28.646 A:middle
CSV and this starts a process

00:24:28.646 --> 00:24:29.606 A:middle
that we call Activity.

00:24:30.316 --> 00:24:32.746 A:middle
An Activity it's a way to track

00:24:33.436 --> 00:24:34.876 A:middle
background processes or

00:24:34.876 --> 00:24:35.976 A:middle
long-running jobs.

00:24:40.066 --> 00:24:42.166 A:middle
Now I just jump to the Activity

00:24:42.246 --> 00:24:46.276 A:middle
path and you can see here the

00:24:46.276 --> 00:24:47.856 A:middle
creation of the sign-in sheet.

00:24:48.406 --> 00:24:50.336 A:middle
As you can tell, I've been very

00:24:50.336 --> 00:24:51.866 A:middle
busy today, it's the first day

00:24:51.866 --> 00:24:54.546 A:middle
of the school so I had to delete

00:24:54.546 --> 00:24:55.996 A:middle
some accounts, create sign-I

00:24:55.996 --> 00:24:57.476 A:middle
sheets for other students,

00:24:58.036 --> 00:24:59.426 A:middle
change the password policy of

00:24:59.426 --> 00:25:02.276 A:middle
some accounts, add new roles,

00:24:59.426 --> 00:25:02.276 A:middle
some accounts, add new roles,

00:25:03.506 --> 00:25:05.296 A:middle
and also I had some problems

00:25:05.296 --> 00:25:06.676 A:middle
with some of the operations.

00:25:07.186 --> 00:25:09.476 A:middle
This also allows us to be able

00:25:09.476 --> 00:25:12.476 A:middle
to be able to notice any

00:25:12.476 --> 00:25:13.796 A:middle
problems that we have to our

00:25:13.796 --> 00:25:15.136 A:middle
process of administrating.

00:25:16.956 --> 00:25:18.826 A:middle
Creating our new sign-in sheets

00:25:18.826 --> 00:25:19.516 A:middle
is almost over.

00:25:19.786 --> 00:25:23.646 A:middle
So, I'm just going to wait for a

00:25:23.646 --> 00:25:23.976 A:middle
second.

00:25:28.066 --> 00:25:29.506 A:middle
Now I'm ready to download that

00:25:29.506 --> 00:25:29.946 A:middle
sign-in sheet.

00:25:30.866 --> 00:25:32.786 A:middle
So, I wanted it in an 8-up PDF

00:25:32.786 --> 00:25:33.936 A:middle
format because I want to save

00:25:33.936 --> 00:25:34.466 A:middle
some paper.

00:25:40.046 --> 00:25:41.496 A:middle
I download it and here is the

00:25:41.496 --> 00:25:42.686 A:middle
sign-in sheet for my new

00:25:42.686 --> 00:25:42.976 A:middle
students.

00:25:51.046 --> 00:25:51.726 A:middle
So that was easy.

00:25:51.726 --> 00:25:53.946 A:middle
Now let's talk about managing

00:25:53.946 --> 00:25:55.366 A:middle
your content.

00:25:56.956 --> 00:25:58.936 A:middle
Currently, I can navigate to

00:25:58.936 --> 00:26:01.336 A:middle
Apps and Books and here I'm

00:25:58.936 --> 00:26:01.336 A:middle
Apps and Books and here I'm

00:26:01.336 --> 00:26:03.186 A:middle
presented to a link that will

00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:04.546 A:middle
take me to the Volume Purchase

00:26:04.546 --> 00:26:04.946 A:middle
Program.

00:26:06.326 --> 00:26:07.516 A:middle
In the Volume Purchase Program

00:26:07.516 --> 00:26:09.316 A:middle
website, you will be able to

00:26:09.316 --> 00:26:11.646 A:middle
purchase applications and iBooks

00:26:11.646 --> 00:26:12.176 A:middle
in bulk.

00:26:12.776 --> 00:26:15.296 A:middle
I'm really happy to announce

00:26:15.336 --> 00:26:19.076 A:middle
today that we are working on

00:26:19.076 --> 00:26:20.676 A:middle
integrating the Volume Purchase

00:26:20.676 --> 00:26:23.716 A:middle
Program into Apple School and

00:26:23.716 --> 00:26:26.006 A:middle
it's coming before the end of

00:26:27.216 --> 00:26:27.436 A:middle
the year.

00:26:27.536 --> 00:26:28.566 A:middle
Now let's look what it looks

00:26:28.566 --> 00:26:28.826 A:middle
like.

00:26:30.616 --> 00:26:33.776 A:middle
Here's a screenshot that is

00:26:33.776 --> 00:26:35.816 A:middle
showing you the inventory of

00:26:35.816 --> 00:26:38.366 A:middle
applications of all devices that

00:26:38.366 --> 00:26:40.596 A:middle
you have purchased for the Apple

00:26:40.596 --> 00:26:41.276 A:middle
School district.

00:26:41.876 --> 00:26:42.746 A:middle
You see the ones that are

00:26:42.746 --> 00:26:44.346 A:middle
available, all the ones that are

00:26:44.346 --> 00:26:44.896 A:middle
in use.

00:26:45.676 --> 00:26:48.196 A:middle
And then in this next screen you

00:26:48.196 --> 00:26:49.256 A:middle
are seeing that I'm trying to

00:26:49.256 --> 00:26:51.486 A:middle
purchase an iBook, 50 licenses

00:26:51.486 --> 00:26:53.096 A:middle
of it and assigning them to

00:26:53.096 --> 00:26:53.956 A:middle
Covington Charter School.

00:26:59.146 --> 00:27:00.816 A:middle
Now let's have Todd talk to you

00:26:59.146 --> 00:27:00.816 A:middle
Now let's have Todd talk to you

00:27:00.816 --> 00:27:02.636 A:middle
more about the details of this

00:27:02.636 --> 00:27:03.976 A:middle
new distribution model.

00:27:04.516 --> 00:27:09.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:10.046 --> 00:27:11.446 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much Juan.

00:27:11.446 --> 00:27:12.546 A:middle
As some of you may have noticed,

00:27:12.546 --> 00:27:13.786 A:middle
we've now included the

00:27:13.786 --> 00:27:14.936 A:middle
enrollment section and moved

00:27:14.936 --> 00:27:16.136 A:middle
into distribution now that we're

00:27:16.136 --> 00:27:17.276 A:middle
talking about volume purchase.

00:27:17.776 --> 00:27:19.926 A:middle
However, I wanted to reiterate

00:27:19.926 --> 00:27:21.456 A:middle
that the new Leave Remote

00:27:21.456 --> 00:27:22.666 A:middle
Management button at the bottom

00:27:22.666 --> 00:27:24.006 A:middle
of the new Remote Management

00:27:24.006 --> 00:27:26.506 A:middle
pane in Setup Assistant only

00:27:26.506 --> 00:27:27.916 A:middle
appears during that 30-day

00:27:27.916 --> 00:27:29.596 A:middle
provisional period after adding

00:27:29.596 --> 00:27:30.896 A:middle
devices to the Device Enrollment

00:27:30.896 --> 00:27:32.186 A:middle
Program using the new feature

00:27:32.186 --> 00:27:33.006 A:middle
that Can demoed.

00:27:33.476 --> 00:27:34.816 A:middle
Devices that have been added by

00:27:34.816 --> 00:27:36.226 A:middle
purchasing directly from Apple

00:27:36.506 --> 00:27:37.966 A:middle
or through a reseller which

00:27:37.966 --> 00:27:39.276 A:middle
supports the Device Enrollment

00:27:39.276 --> 00:27:40.956 A:middle
Program there's no change and

00:27:40.956 --> 00:27:41.956 A:middle
that button will not appear.

00:27:47.046 --> 00:27:47.756 A:middle
So, we have a short agenda for

00:27:47.756 --> 00:27:49.076 A:middle
distribution, but it's a really

00:27:49.076 --> 00:27:50.926 A:middle
big topic upfront Volume

00:27:50.926 --> 00:27:51.896 A:middle
Purchase Program fully

00:27:51.896 --> 00:27:52.986 A:middle
integrated into Apple School

00:27:52.986 --> 00:27:53.466 A:middle
Manager.

00:27:53.516 --> 00:27:55.156 A:middle
And I will go into a bit more

00:27:55.156 --> 00:27:56.946 A:middle
detail and cover a few

00:27:56.946 --> 00:27:59.876 A:middle
additional features and a brief

00:27:59.876 --> 00:28:01.786 A:middle
update about changes to

00:27:59.876 --> 00:28:01.786 A:middle
update about changes to

00:28:01.786 --> 00:28:03.356 A:middle
installing apps and managing

00:28:03.356 --> 00:28:04.526 A:middle
them on tvOS.

00:28:06.646 --> 00:28:07.926 A:middle
So, Juan has already shown you

00:28:07.926 --> 00:28:09.616 A:middle
the beautiful new updated UI in

00:28:09.616 --> 00:28:10.916 A:middle
Apple School Manager which went

00:28:10.916 --> 00:28:12.656 A:middle
live last month, as well as a

00:28:12.656 --> 00:28:14.776 A:middle
sneak peek into how Volume

00:28:14.776 --> 00:28:16.056 A:middle
Purchase Program will look once

00:28:16.186 --> 00:28:18.466 A:middle
it's integrated into it.

00:28:18.716 --> 00:28:19.816 A:middle
We are also making it much

00:28:19.816 --> 00:28:20.986 A:middle
easier to manage multiple

00:28:20.986 --> 00:28:22.886 A:middle
locations, tokens, and licenses

00:28:22.886 --> 00:28:24.056 A:middle
within an organization,

00:28:24.866 --> 00:28:26.596 A:middle
including supporting

00:28:26.596 --> 00:28:28.056 A:middle
transferring licenses between

00:28:28.056 --> 00:28:30.306 A:middle
locations so that your content

00:28:30.306 --> 00:28:31.486 A:middle
managers no longer will need to

00:28:31.486 --> 00:28:32.436 A:middle
share credentials.

00:28:32.536 --> 00:28:34.956 A:middle
All of this will be available

00:28:34.956 --> 00:28:36.856 A:middle
very soon as Juan mentioned, but

00:28:36.856 --> 00:28:38.236 A:middle
there is a bit of work for MDM

00:28:38.236 --> 00:28:39.986 A:middle
vendors to do to support license

00:28:39.986 --> 00:28:41.406 A:middle
transfer in particular, which

00:28:41.406 --> 00:28:42.366 A:middle
again I'll cover today.

00:28:44.406 --> 00:28:45.866 A:middle
So, for a long time we've heard

00:28:45.866 --> 00:28:47.406 A:middle
some customer feedback around

00:28:47.606 --> 00:28:48.796 A:middle
the difficulty in managing

00:28:48.796 --> 00:28:50.546 A:middle
multiple VPP accounts so we

00:28:50.546 --> 00:28:52.276 A:middle
wanted to make it much easier

00:28:52.276 --> 00:28:53.406 A:middle
for schools to organize their

00:28:53.406 --> 00:28:54.966 A:middle
purchases and manage them in an

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:56.686 A:middle
intuitive way that matches their

00:28:56.686 --> 00:28:57.826 A:middle
organizational structure.

00:28:59.386 --> 00:29:01.636 A:middle
So, with these updates purchases

00:28:59.386 --> 00:29:01.636 A:middle
So, with these updates purchases

00:29:01.716 --> 00:29:02.846 A:middle
are now associated with a

00:29:02.846 --> 00:29:04.326 A:middle
location rather than the

00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:05.936 A:middle
personal inventory of individual

00:29:05.936 --> 00:29:06.886 A:middle
content managers.

00:29:08.006 --> 00:29:09.526 A:middle
Multiple content managers can

00:29:09.526 --> 00:29:11.356 A:middle
purchase apps and books for a

00:29:11.356 --> 00:29:14.056 A:middle
single location and all licenses

00:29:14.056 --> 00:29:15.086 A:middle
for that location will be

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:16.416 A:middle
managed with a single token.

00:29:17.696 --> 00:29:19.206 A:middle
So, there's no longer a need for

00:29:19.206 --> 00:29:20.676 A:middle
a token per content manager.

00:29:21.096 --> 00:29:24.086 A:middle
Each content manager through

00:29:24.086 --> 00:29:25.476 A:middle
that token can then manage all

00:29:25.476 --> 00:29:26.946 A:middle
licenses that are associated

00:29:26.946 --> 00:29:28.786 A:middle
with that location, meaning that

00:29:28.786 --> 00:29:30.746 A:middle
if a content manager leaves any

00:29:30.746 --> 00:29:31.916 A:middle
other content manager can

00:29:31.916 --> 00:29:33.256 A:middle
continue to manage all of those

00:29:33.256 --> 00:29:33.896 A:middle
licenses.

00:29:36.186 --> 00:29:37.426 A:middle
Just illustrate this with a

00:29:37.426 --> 00:29:38.526 A:middle
simple animation.

00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:39.676 A:middle
Now I have two different content

00:29:39.676 --> 00:29:40.906 A:middle
managers each of them buying

00:29:40.906 --> 00:29:42.736 A:middle
some apps and buying some books.

00:29:43.546 --> 00:29:44.966 A:middle
There's a token that either one

00:29:44.966 --> 00:29:46.516 A:middle
of those managers can download

00:29:46.656 --> 00:29:48.476 A:middle
from the Volume Purchase Program

00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:50.526 A:middle
and upload to their MDM server

00:29:50.526 --> 00:29:52.096 A:middle
to allow it to manage those

00:29:52.096 --> 00:29:54.026 A:middle
licenses and assign them to

00:29:54.026 --> 00:29:55.136 A:middle
users and devices.

00:29:57.016 --> 00:29:58.526 A:middle
Another bit of feedback we've

00:29:58.526 --> 00:30:00.696 A:middle
gotten is the request to be able

00:29:58.526 --> 00:30:00.696 A:middle
gotten is the request to be able

00:30:00.696 --> 00:30:02.176 A:middle
to transfer licenses that were

00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:04.866 A:middle
purchased in one area to a

00:30:04.866 --> 00:30:05.676 A:middle
different area.

00:30:06.046 --> 00:30:07.376 A:middle
And so, we have now added

00:30:07.376 --> 00:30:08.566 A:middle
support for transferring

00:30:08.566 --> 00:30:10.216 A:middle
licenses between locations which

00:30:10.216 --> 00:30:12.346 A:middle
are now tracked with a single

00:30:12.346 --> 00:30:12.806 A:middle
token.

00:30:13.996 --> 00:30:15.456 A:middle
Apple School Manager of course

00:30:15.456 --> 00:30:17.426 A:middle
will show the accurate number of

00:30:17.426 --> 00:30:18.796 A:middle
available licenses at each

00:30:18.796 --> 00:30:20.456 A:middle
location as these transfers take

00:30:20.456 --> 00:30:20.926 A:middle
place.

00:30:21.626 --> 00:30:23.546 A:middle
Any licenses which are currently

00:30:23.546 --> 00:30:24.946 A:middle
available and not assigned can

00:30:24.946 --> 00:30:26.226 A:middle
be transferred at any time.

00:30:26.946 --> 00:30:27.876 A:middle
But if they're licenses that are

00:30:27.876 --> 00:30:29.416 A:middle
already assigned to a user or

00:30:29.416 --> 00:30:30.866 A:middle
device those can't be

00:30:30.866 --> 00:30:32.106 A:middle
transferred because of course,

00:30:32.156 --> 00:30:33.406 A:middle
those users and devices are

00:30:33.406 --> 00:30:34.786 A:middle
associated with that location as

00:30:34.786 --> 00:30:36.056 A:middle
well and it would disrupt your

00:30:36.056 --> 00:30:36.616 A:middle
deployment.

00:30:37.046 --> 00:30:38.406 A:middle
So, if you do want to actually

00:30:38.406 --> 00:30:39.886 A:middle
transfer those licenses you can

00:30:39.886 --> 00:30:41.456 A:middle
revoke them, the current

00:30:41.456 --> 00:30:42.706 A:middle
assignment, making them

00:30:42.706 --> 00:30:43.706 A:middle
available for transfer.

00:30:44.216 --> 00:30:47.456 A:middle
And simple animation we've got

00:30:47.456 --> 00:30:49.056 A:middle
two locations each represented

00:30:49.056 --> 00:30:51.836 A:middle
with its token to manage their

00:30:51.836 --> 00:30:53.106 A:middle
apps and books and we can

00:30:53.106 --> 00:30:54.976 A:middle
transfer apps from one location

00:30:55.126 --> 00:30:55.656 A:middle
to the other.

00:30:57.136 --> 00:30:59.656 A:middle
And each location continues to

00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:02.076 A:middle
be managing those licenses, so

00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:02.076 A:middle
be managing those licenses, so

00:31:02.126 --> 00:31:04.226 A:middle
if location one is at one MDM

00:31:04.226 --> 00:31:06.466 A:middle
server, location two another MDM

00:31:06.466 --> 00:31:07.926 A:middle
server they can continue to

00:31:07.926 --> 00:31:09.866 A:middle
manage the appropriate app and

00:31:09.866 --> 00:31:10.746 A:middle
book licenses.

00:31:12.546 --> 00:31:14.306 A:middle
Another sneak peek, this is what

00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:15.286 A:middle
it will look like once it's

00:31:15.286 --> 00:31:16.216 A:middle
integrated in Apple School

00:31:16.216 --> 00:31:18.166 A:middle
Manager showing you for each app

00:31:18.166 --> 00:31:19.526 A:middle
that you've purchased the

00:31:19.526 --> 00:31:22.386 A:middle
licenses for each location and

00:31:22.386 --> 00:31:23.576 A:middle
making it very easy to then

00:31:23.576 --> 00:31:25.076 A:middle
select the location and transfer

00:31:25.076 --> 00:31:26.196 A:middle
some of those licenses to

00:31:26.196 --> 00:31:26.546 A:middle
another.

00:31:29.126 --> 00:31:30.666 A:middle
So, now I'd like to highlight

00:31:30.666 --> 00:31:32.126 A:middle
what we need and our MDM

00:31:32.126 --> 00:31:33.316 A:middle
partners to do to support

00:31:33.316 --> 00:31:34.776 A:middle
license transfer and these new

00:31:34.776 --> 00:31:35.236 A:middle
features.

00:31:35.236 --> 00:31:37.296 A:middle
So, the first is now that a

00:31:37.296 --> 00:31:39.106 A:middle
location and token have a

00:31:39.106 --> 00:31:41.126 A:middle
one-to-one relationship as

00:31:41.126 --> 00:31:42.536 A:middle
tokens expire or otherwise

00:31:42.536 --> 00:31:43.726 A:middle
become invalid it's going to be

00:31:43.726 --> 00:31:45.016 A:middle
important to make it easy for

00:31:45.016 --> 00:31:46.616 A:middle
admins to identify which token

00:31:46.616 --> 00:31:48.546 A:middle
needs renewal by making clear

00:31:48.546 --> 00:31:49.866 A:middle
which location this token is

00:31:49.866 --> 00:31:50.156 A:middle
for.

00:31:50.686 --> 00:31:52.186 A:middle
And our API calls that you're

00:31:52.186 --> 00:31:54.576 A:middle
already using to get information

00:31:54.576 --> 00:31:56.076 A:middle
about the Volume Purchase

00:31:56.076 --> 00:31:57.576 A:middle
Program have now been enhanced

00:31:57.576 --> 00:31:58.826 A:middle
to provide that information to

00:31:58.826 --> 00:32:00.606 A:middle
you so that you can update your

00:31:58.826 --> 00:32:00.606 A:middle
you so that you can update your

00:32:00.606 --> 00:32:01.336 A:middle
UI appropriately.

00:32:03.326 --> 00:32:04.646 A:middle
Now that multiple content

00:32:04.646 --> 00:32:06.166 A:middle
managers can download the same

00:32:06.206 --> 00:32:08.366 A:middle
token for a location you need to

00:32:08.366 --> 00:32:10.336 A:middle
also be prepared for a content

00:32:10.336 --> 00:32:12.146 A:middle
manager to inadvertently upload

00:32:12.146 --> 00:32:13.716 A:middle
a duplicate token and handle

00:32:13.716 --> 00:32:14.926 A:middle
that appropriately so that you

00:32:14.926 --> 00:32:16.286 A:middle
don't duplicate the license

00:32:17.916 --> 00:32:18.256 A:middle
count.

00:32:18.256 --> 00:32:20.136 A:middle
Similarly, now licenses can be

00:32:20.136 --> 00:32:22.426 A:middle
transferred outside of your MDM

00:32:22.546 --> 00:32:24.016 A:middle
server's knowledge in Apple

00:32:24.016 --> 00:32:24.726 A:middle
School Manager.

00:32:24.936 --> 00:32:26.276 A:middle
So, you need to be prepared to

00:32:26.276 --> 00:32:27.796 A:middle
refresh your license counts when

00:32:27.796 --> 00:32:28.776 A:middle
you update your UI.

00:32:31.936 --> 00:32:34.186 A:middle
Finally, when is this all

00:32:34.186 --> 00:32:34.476 A:middle
coming?

00:32:34.476 --> 00:32:35.726 A:middle
We're working hard on preparing

00:32:35.726 --> 00:32:37.066 A:middle
the documentation update, as

00:32:37.066 --> 00:32:38.386 A:middle
well as testing support which

00:32:38.386 --> 00:32:40.206 A:middle
will be available soon and

00:32:40.206 --> 00:32:41.656 A:middle
releasing later this summer so

00:32:41.656 --> 00:32:43.346 A:middle
that you can help us and our

00:32:43.346 --> 00:32:44.776 A:middle
joint customers in schools be

00:32:44.776 --> 00:32:45.856 A:middle
ready for back-to-school

00:32:45.856 --> 00:32:46.316 A:middle
deployment.

00:32:49.266 --> 00:32:50.916 A:middle
That concludes our section on

00:32:51.086 --> 00:32:52.746 A:middle
Volume Purchase Program and now

00:32:52.746 --> 00:32:54.006 A:middle
I'd like to do a couple of

00:32:54.006 --> 00:32:55.186 A:middle
updates on tvOS.

00:32:55.636 --> 00:32:57.116 A:middle
It's now possible to install

00:32:57.116 --> 00:32:59.556 A:middle
enterprise apps on tvOS, as well

00:32:59.556 --> 00:33:01.246 A:middle
as manage them using Managed App

00:32:59.556 --> 00:33:01.246 A:middle
as manage them using Managed App

00:33:01.246 --> 00:33:02.076 A:middle
Configuration.

00:33:02.246 --> 00:33:03.396 A:middle
A great feature that we've had

00:33:03.396 --> 00:33:05.266 A:middle
in iOS for a number of years is

00:33:05.266 --> 00:33:08.036 A:middle
now available in tvOS as well to

00:33:08.036 --> 00:33:09.346 A:middle
configure your apps after you

00:33:09.606 --> 00:33:10.166 A:middle
deploy them.

00:33:11.836 --> 00:33:13.286 A:middle
And that brings us to the end of

00:33:13.286 --> 00:33:14.866 A:middle
our distribution section, so I'd

00:33:14.866 --> 00:33:16.146 A:middle
like to ask Pradhap to come up

00:33:16.146 --> 00:33:17.316 A:middle
on stage and take you through

00:33:17.316 --> 00:33:18.186 A:middle
the management section.

00:33:18.606 --> 00:33:18.966 A:middle
Pradhap.

00:33:19.516 --> 00:33:22.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:33:23.046 --> 00:33:23.446 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Todd.

00:33:24.426 --> 00:33:25.896 A:middle
Hello everyone, good afternoon.

00:33:26.476 --> 00:33:28.086 A:middle
I'm very excited to be here to

00:33:28.086 --> 00:33:29.216 A:middle
walk you through all the great

00:33:29.216 --> 00:33:30.736 A:middle
management features that we

00:33:30.736 --> 00:33:32.436 A:middle
added since we met the last

00:33:32.436 --> 00:33:32.626 A:middle
year.

00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:34.826 A:middle
First, let's get started with

00:33:35.606 --> 00:33:35.726 A:middle
iOS.

00:33:36.716 --> 00:33:38.806 A:middle
Preparing a large number of iOS

00:33:38.806 --> 00:33:40.476 A:middle
devices, especially with a lot

00:33:40.476 --> 00:33:42.316 A:middle
of apps and books using a Wi-Fi

00:33:42.316 --> 00:33:43.866 A:middle
network has always been a

00:33:43.866 --> 00:33:44.446 A:middle
challenge.

00:33:44.946 --> 00:33:46.216 A:middle
It makes a Wi-Fi network

00:33:46.216 --> 00:33:47.946 A:middle
unusable and more often,

00:33:47.946 --> 00:33:49.376 A:middle
administrators had to set up a

00:33:49.376 --> 00:33:51.146 A:middle
dedicated Wi-Fi network just for

00:33:51.146 --> 00:33:52.196 A:middle
preparing devices.

00:33:52.806 --> 00:33:54.756 A:middle
To solve this, we added a new

00:33:54.756 --> 00:33:56.516 A:middle
option to all the MDM commands

00:33:57.006 --> 00:33:58.196 A:middle
using which the administrator

00:33:58.196 --> 00:33:59.976 A:middle
can specify that the device has

00:33:59.976 --> 00:34:01.196 A:middle
to be connected to a wired

00:33:59.976 --> 00:34:01.196 A:middle
to be connected to a wired

00:34:01.196 --> 00:34:03.186 A:middle
network like Internet sharing or

00:34:03.256 --> 00:34:05.626 A:middle
USB or an ethernet connection to

00:34:05.626 --> 00:34:06.526 A:middle
perform a command.

00:34:07.326 --> 00:34:09.176 A:middle
This combined with content

00:34:09.176 --> 00:34:10.755 A:middle
cashing on macOS is going to

00:34:10.755 --> 00:34:12.146 A:middle
significantly improve the setup

00:34:12.146 --> 00:34:13.856 A:middle
experience for iOS devices.

00:34:16.576 --> 00:34:18.686 A:middle
MDM already has the ability to

00:34:18.686 --> 00:34:21.286 A:middle
install software updates on DEP

00:34:21.286 --> 00:34:23.065 A:middle
devices without a passcode.

00:34:23.735 --> 00:34:24.876 A:middle
We improved that and added

00:34:24.876 --> 00:34:26.585 A:middle
support for passcode lock

00:34:26.585 --> 00:34:29.755 A:middle
devices and supervised non-DEP

00:34:29.755 --> 00:34:32.356 A:middle
devices as well.

00:34:32.545 --> 00:34:34.565 A:middle
We realize that in most cases

00:34:34.795 --> 00:34:35.985 A:middle
when a device with an app or

00:34:36.096 --> 00:34:37.666 A:middle
[inaudible] is erased the data

00:34:37.666 --> 00:34:38.996 A:middle
plan shouldn't be erased as

00:34:38.996 --> 00:34:40.606 A:middle
well, so we added an option to

00:34:40.606 --> 00:34:42.335 A:middle
the erase device command to

00:34:42.335 --> 00:34:43.786 A:middle
specify the data plan

00:34:43.786 --> 00:34:44.436 A:middle
preference.

00:34:45.525 --> 00:34:47.156 A:middle
Before I move on I would like to

00:34:47.156 --> 00:34:48.856 A:middle
point out that the features that

00:34:48.856 --> 00:34:50.196 A:middle
are marked with the new badge

00:34:50.676 --> 00:34:51.985 A:middle
are new in the upcoming iOS

00:34:51.985 --> 00:34:53.346 A:middle
releases that we announced in

00:34:53.436 --> 00:34:55.326 A:middle
[inaudible] this week and all

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:56.666 A:middle
the other features [inaudible]

00:34:56.755 --> 00:34:57.616 A:middle
earlier this year.

00:34:58.256 --> 00:35:00.316 A:middle
And also, if you see a new badge

00:34:58.256 --> 00:35:00.316 A:middle
And also, if you see a new badge

00:35:00.316 --> 00:35:01.526 A:middle
on the upper right corner of the

00:35:01.526 --> 00:35:03.336 A:middle
slide everything on that slide

00:35:04.156 --> 00:35:05.176 A:middle
is new.

00:35:05.416 --> 00:35:07.186 A:middle
Next, let's talk about Lost and

00:35:07.186 --> 00:35:07.486 A:middle
Found.

00:35:08.796 --> 00:35:10.536 A:middle
All the users love our devices,

00:35:10.536 --> 00:35:11.846 A:middle
but sometimes they go missing.

00:35:12.986 --> 00:35:15.736 A:middle
MDM already supports putting a

00:35:15.736 --> 00:35:17.496 A:middle
device in loss mode and also

00:35:17.496 --> 00:35:19.096 A:middle
query the location of the device

00:35:19.096 --> 00:35:20.426 A:middle
when the device is in lost mode.

00:35:21.396 --> 00:35:23.786 A:middle
We also added support to play a

00:35:23.786 --> 00:35:25.296 A:middle
sound when the device is in lost

00:35:25.296 --> 00:35:25.536 A:middle
mode.

00:35:26.796 --> 00:35:28.346 A:middle
And we updated the device

00:35:28.346 --> 00:35:30.306 A:middle
location query to include all

00:35:30.306 --> 00:35:32.126 A:middle
the location attributes that you

00:35:32.126 --> 00:35:33.546 A:middle
would expect from a location

00:35:33.546 --> 00:35:33.826 A:middle
APA.

00:35:34.286 --> 00:35:37.726 A:middle
Like devices apps go missing as

00:35:37.726 --> 00:35:39.246 A:middle
well, so we added a new

00:35:39.246 --> 00:35:41.556 A:middle
restriction to prevent users

00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:43.716 A:middle
from deleting system apps

00:35:43.716 --> 00:35:45.366 A:middle
accidentally on their device.

00:35:45.796 --> 00:35:47.576 A:middle
This is especially great for

00:35:47.576 --> 00:35:49.606 A:middle
shard use devices where the App

00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:50.706 A:middle
Store may be disabled.

00:35:51.216 --> 00:35:55.426 A:middle
We continuously add new features

00:35:55.426 --> 00:35:57.176 A:middle
to help enterprises keep their

00:35:57.176 --> 00:35:57.956 A:middle
data safe.

00:35:58.786 --> 00:36:00.586 A:middle
Starting with iOS 10.3

00:35:58.786 --> 00:36:00.586 A:middle
Starting with iOS 10.3

00:36:00.586 --> 00:36:02.426 A:middle
administrators can restrict the

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:03.716 A:middle
list of Wi-Fi networks that the

00:36:03.716 --> 00:36:05.746 A:middle
device can join to just the

00:36:05.746 --> 00:36:06.676 A:middle
Wi-Fi networks that are

00:36:06.676 --> 00:36:08.426 A:middle
configured by MDM or our

00:36:08.426 --> 00:36:09.776 A:middle
configuration profiles.

00:36:10.606 --> 00:36:13.236 A:middle
Thank you.

00:36:15.066 --> 00:36:16.846 A:middle
And starting with iOS 11 the

00:36:16.846 --> 00:36:18.536 A:middle
Wi-Fi restriction exempts

00:36:18.566 --> 00:36:19.596 A:middle
carrier profiles.

00:36:20.836 --> 00:36:22.186 A:middle
We recommend that you push the

00:36:22.186 --> 00:36:24.606 A:middle
Wi-Fi restriction together or

00:36:24.666 --> 00:36:25.876 A:middle
after the Wi-Fi payload,

00:36:26.206 --> 00:36:27.606 A:middle
otherwise you run the risk of

00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:30.566 A:middle
devices losing connectivity to

00:36:31.216 --> 00:36:32.236 A:middle
MDM server.

00:36:32.386 --> 00:36:33.896 A:middle
We also added a new restriction

00:36:33.896 --> 00:36:35.826 A:middle
to disable users from creating

00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:37.616 A:middle
their own VPN configurations.

00:36:39.456 --> 00:36:41.176 A:middle
MDM already supports

00:36:41.176 --> 00:36:42.866 A:middle
configuring, signing and

00:36:42.866 --> 00:36:44.286 A:middle
encryption identities for

00:36:44.286 --> 00:36:45.796 A:middle
exchange and mail, but there was

00:36:45.796 --> 00:36:47.916 A:middle
only one global switch to turn

00:36:47.916 --> 00:36:49.436 A:middle
both signing and encryption on

00:36:49.436 --> 00:36:49.816 A:middle
or off.

00:36:50.406 --> 00:36:52.156 A:middle
We improved that and added a new

00:36:52.156 --> 00:36:53.536 A:middle
key so that you can control

00:36:53.536 --> 00:36:54.516 A:middle
signing and encryption

00:36:54.516 --> 00:36:55.296 A:middle
independently.

00:36:55.836 --> 00:36:59.696 A:middle
We added three new restrictions

00:36:59.696 --> 00:37:01.486 A:middle
to Classroom to make the

00:36:59.696 --> 00:37:01.486 A:middle
to Classroom to make the

00:37:01.486 --> 00:37:04.106 A:middle
expedience of unmanaged classes

00:37:04.106 --> 00:37:06.356 A:middle
on supervised devices on par

00:37:06.356 --> 00:37:07.596 A:middle
with managed classes.

00:37:08.136 --> 00:37:10.416 A:middle
The first new restrictions

00:37:10.716 --> 00:37:12.346 A:middle
enables an instructor to observe

00:37:12.346 --> 00:37:14.936 A:middle
a student's screen and perform

00:37:14.936 --> 00:37:17.336 A:middle
an app or a device log without

00:37:17.336 --> 00:37:19.156 A:middle
prompting the students just like

00:37:19.156 --> 00:37:20.146 A:middle
managed classes.

00:37:20.916 --> 00:37:22.406 A:middle
And the last one causes the

00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:24.026 A:middle
students to automatically join

00:37:24.026 --> 00:37:25.886 A:middle
classes without prompting them

00:37:25.886 --> 00:37:27.056 A:middle
every time.

00:37:28.656 --> 00:37:30.836 A:middle
With iOS 11 we made a lot of

00:37:30.836 --> 00:37:31.996 A:middle
improvements to the AirPrint

00:37:31.996 --> 00:37:32.406 A:middle
payload.

00:37:33.196 --> 00:37:34.246 A:middle
The AirPrint payload now

00:37:34.246 --> 00:37:36.676 A:middle
supports configuring custom port

00:37:37.586 --> 00:37:39.836 A:middle
and also specify whether TLS is

00:37:39.836 --> 00:37:41.336 A:middle
required on a per app and

00:37:41.336 --> 00:37:42.476 A:middle
destination basis.

00:37:43.416 --> 00:37:44.656 A:middle
In addition to the improvements

00:37:44.656 --> 00:37:46.396 A:middle
to the payload we also added

00:37:46.586 --> 00:37:48.136 A:middle
four new restrictions to

00:37:48.136 --> 00:37:49.496 A:middle
configure global AirPrint

00:37:49.496 --> 00:37:50.146 A:middle
options.

00:37:50.726 --> 00:37:51.886 A:middle
The first restriction can be

00:37:51.886 --> 00:37:53.996 A:middle
used to disable iBeacon

00:37:53.996 --> 00:37:55.876 A:middle
discovery of AirPrint printers.

00:37:56.416 --> 00:37:58.026 A:middle
And the second one can be used

00:37:58.026 --> 00:37:59.796 A:middle
to disable storage of AirPrint

00:37:59.796 --> 00:38:01.076 A:middle
credentials in Keychain.

00:37:59.796 --> 00:38:01.076 A:middle
credentials in Keychain.

00:38:01.616 --> 00:38:06.676 A:middle
You can also require TLS for all

00:38:06.676 --> 00:38:07.736 A:middle
AirPrint connections on a

00:38:07.736 --> 00:38:08.296 A:middle
device.

00:38:08.646 --> 00:38:10.306 A:middle
And finally, you can disable

00:38:10.376 --> 00:38:11.896 A:middle
AirPrint completely on a device

00:38:11.896 --> 00:38:15.026 A:middle
if you have to do so.

00:38:15.266 --> 00:38:17.016 A:middle
As you may have heard earlier

00:38:17.016 --> 00:38:19.686 A:middle
this week, iOS 11 supports a new

00:38:19.686 --> 00:38:21.726 A:middle
extension using which apps can

00:38:21.726 --> 00:38:24.316 A:middle
provide a DNS proxy and we added

00:38:24.316 --> 00:38:25.726 A:middle
a payload just to configure

00:38:25.726 --> 00:38:26.076 A:middle
that.

00:38:26.976 --> 00:38:28.656 A:middle
The new DNS proxy extension

00:38:28.656 --> 00:38:30.266 A:middle
payload can be used to configure

00:38:30.266 --> 00:38:32.366 A:middle
the bundle ID of the extension

00:38:32.366 --> 00:38:34.316 A:middle
that should be used as DNS proxy

00:38:34.696 --> 00:38:36.716 A:middle
and also provide any custom

00:38:36.716 --> 00:38:38.236 A:middle
configuration that the extension

00:38:38.376 --> 00:38:39.266 A:middle
might need.

00:38:40.096 --> 00:38:42.016 A:middle
The cellular payload now

00:38:42.016 --> 00:38:43.496 A:middle
supports configuring Internet

00:38:43.526 --> 00:38:44.976 A:middle
protocol versions for cellular

00:38:44.976 --> 00:38:45.666 A:middle
connections.

00:38:46.206 --> 00:38:51.186 A:middle
Like iOS we also added a lot of

00:38:51.186 --> 00:38:52.906 A:middle
new features to macOS to improve

00:38:52.906 --> 00:38:54.156 A:middle
the setup experience.

00:38:54.826 --> 00:38:56.646 A:middle
The new system migration payload

00:38:56.816 --> 00:38:58.506 A:middle
can be used to configure custom

00:38:58.506 --> 00:39:00.346 A:middle
migration paths for migration

00:38:58.506 --> 00:39:00.346 A:middle
migration paths for migration

00:39:00.346 --> 00:39:01.976 A:middle
from Windows to Mac.

00:39:03.546 --> 00:39:05.056 A:middle
We also added a new payload to

00:39:05.056 --> 00:39:06.726 A:middle
configure smart card options on

00:39:06.726 --> 00:39:06.866 A:middle
Mac.

00:39:08.046 --> 00:39:09.296 A:middle
This payload can be used to

00:39:09.296 --> 00:39:10.886 A:middle
restrict one smart card per

00:39:10.886 --> 00:39:12.666 A:middle
user, required trusted

00:39:13.066 --> 00:39:14.906 A:middle
connections for smart card and

00:39:14.906 --> 00:39:16.976 A:middle
also disable smart card usage on

00:39:17.686 --> 00:39:17.786 A:middle
Mac.

00:39:18.596 --> 00:39:21.196 A:middle
We improved the 802.1X payload

00:39:21.686 --> 00:39:23.306 A:middle
adding the ability to provide a

00:39:23.416 --> 00:39:25.566 A:middle
default configuration for ports

00:39:25.906 --> 00:39:27.206 A:middle
that doesn't have an explicit

00:39:27.236 --> 00:39:27.996 A:middle
configuration.

00:39:29.956 --> 00:39:32.206 A:middle
Starting with macOS High Sierra

00:39:32.516 --> 00:39:33.946 A:middle
administrators now have the

00:39:33.946 --> 00:39:35.616 A:middle
ability to delay the software

00:39:35.616 --> 00:39:37.586 A:middle
updates on a Mac for up to a

00:39:37.586 --> 00:39:39.086 A:middle
maximum of 90 days.

00:39:41.096 --> 00:39:43.046 A:middle
This is great for testing your

00:39:43.046 --> 00:39:44.836 A:middle
software on the latest updates

00:39:45.096 --> 00:39:46.776 A:middle
before users get their hands on

00:39:46.776 --> 00:39:46.996 A:middle
them.

00:39:47.666 --> 00:39:49.566 A:middle
We also updated the software

00:39:49.566 --> 00:39:51.786 A:middle
update query to include a date

00:39:51.786 --> 00:39:53.296 A:middle
until which a specific update

00:39:53.296 --> 00:39:54.056 A:middle
will be deferred.

00:39:54.496 --> 00:39:59.216 A:middle
Former passwords on macOS are

00:39:59.216 --> 00:40:01.566 A:middle
equivalent to activation lock on

00:39:59.216 --> 00:40:01.566 A:middle
equivalent to activation lock on

00:40:01.646 --> 00:40:01.976 A:middle
iOS.

00:40:03.066 --> 00:40:04.666 A:middle
Starting with macOS High Sierra

00:40:05.126 --> 00:40:06.356 A:middle
the former passwords can be

00:40:06.356 --> 00:40:08.226 A:middle
completely managed using an MDM

00:40:08.226 --> 00:40:08.636 A:middle
server.

00:40:09.846 --> 00:40:11.426 A:middle
Using the new commands the

00:40:11.426 --> 00:40:13.036 A:middle
administrator can set a former

00:40:13.036 --> 00:40:15.166 A:middle
password, query the status of

00:40:15.166 --> 00:40:17.036 A:middle
the password change, and also

00:40:17.036 --> 00:40:18.346 A:middle
verify that the password on the

00:40:18.346 --> 00:40:19.836 A:middle
device is correct once the

00:40:19.836 --> 00:40:21.406 A:middle
password change is in effect.

00:40:22.026 --> 00:40:22.286 A:middle
Thank you.

00:40:24.236 --> 00:40:26.036 A:middle
I would like to note that a

00:40:26.166 --> 00:40:27.456 A:middle
reboot is required for the

00:40:27.456 --> 00:40:28.936 A:middle
password change to take effect.

00:40:30.116 --> 00:40:31.776 A:middle
We also brought over the user

00:40:31.776 --> 00:40:33.896 A:middle
management commands from iOS to

00:40:33.896 --> 00:40:34.666 A:middle
macOS.

00:40:35.076 --> 00:40:37.286 A:middle
macOS now supports querying the

00:40:37.286 --> 00:40:38.816 A:middle
list of local user accounts on

00:40:38.816 --> 00:40:40.526 A:middle
the Mac and deleting user

00:40:40.526 --> 00:40:41.046 A:middle
accounts.

00:40:41.566 --> 00:40:43.786 A:middle
macOS also supports unlocking a

00:40:43.786 --> 00:40:44.976 A:middle
locked-up user account on Mac.

00:40:50.046 --> 00:40:51.586 A:middle
Extensions are a great way to

00:40:51.586 --> 00:40:53.276 A:middle
add a lot of useful features on

00:40:53.276 --> 00:40:54.996 A:middle
Mac, but we also realize that

00:40:54.996 --> 00:40:56.426 A:middle
there is a need to manage this

00:40:56.426 --> 00:40:58.106 A:middle
in an enterprise environment.

00:40:59.276 --> 00:41:00.396 A:middle
So, the new extensions

00:40:59.276 --> 00:41:00.396 A:middle
So, the new extensions

00:41:00.396 --> 00:41:02.126 A:middle
management payload can be used

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:04.056 A:middle
to configure whitelist and

00:41:04.056 --> 00:41:05.606 A:middle
blacklist of extensions that are

00:41:05.606 --> 00:41:06.876 A:middle
allowed to run on a Mac.

00:41:07.526 --> 00:41:08.806 A:middle
The payload also has the

00:41:08.806 --> 00:41:10.136 A:middle
flexibility to configure

00:41:10.266 --> 00:41:12.346 A:middle
blacklist and whitelist on a per

00:41:12.346 --> 00:41:13.796 A:middle
extension bind basis.

00:41:14.216 --> 00:41:15.686 A:middle
It can go even further and

00:41:15.686 --> 00:41:17.216 A:middle
disable specific extension

00:41:17.216 --> 00:41:19.436 A:middle
points or disable all extensions

00:41:19.436 --> 00:41:20.716 A:middle
on Mac if you have to do so.

00:41:21.966 --> 00:41:23.546 A:middle
Once the extensions are set up

00:41:23.546 --> 00:41:26.076 A:middle
as they need to be the new

00:41:26.146 --> 00:41:27.916 A:middle
active extensions query can be

00:41:27.916 --> 00:41:29.166 A:middle
used to query the list of

00:41:29.166 --> 00:41:31.336 A:middle
extensions that are in use on a

00:41:31.336 --> 00:41:32.396 A:middle
per user basis.

00:41:34.616 --> 00:41:36.976 A:middle
macOS already supports escrowing

00:41:36.976 --> 00:41:38.756 A:middle
encrypted personal recovery keys

00:41:38.756 --> 00:41:40.946 A:middle
to a custom server and starting

00:41:40.946 --> 00:41:42.376 A:middle
with macOS High Sierra we

00:41:42.376 --> 00:41:43.766 A:middle
followed that into MDM.

00:41:44.326 --> 00:41:46.176 A:middle
The new escrow payload can be

00:41:46.176 --> 00:41:47.826 A:middle
used to configure the private

00:41:47.826 --> 00:41:49.336 A:middle
key using which personal

00:41:49.336 --> 00:41:50.836 A:middle
recovery should be encrypted.

00:41:51.636 --> 00:41:53.596 A:middle
And we also updated the security

00:41:53.596 --> 00:41:55.676 A:middle
information query to retrieve

00:41:55.676 --> 00:41:58.186 A:middle
the personal recovery key using

00:41:58.186 --> 00:42:00.016 A:middle
an MDM server.

00:41:58.186 --> 00:42:00.016 A:middle
an MDM server.

00:42:00.156 --> 00:42:01.706 A:middle
We also added a new restriction

00:42:01.706 --> 00:42:03.916 A:middle
to disable iCloud desktop and

00:42:03.916 --> 00:42:04.496 A:middle
documents.

00:42:07.476 --> 00:42:10.046 A:middle
We aggressively added a lot of

00:42:10.206 --> 00:42:12.396 A:middle
features to tvOS this last year.

00:42:13.086 --> 00:42:14.586 A:middle
We set ourselves a goal to

00:42:14.586 --> 00:42:15.716 A:middle
provide a great set of

00:42:15.716 --> 00:42:17.946 A:middle
expedience for Apple TVs without

00:42:17.946 --> 00:42:19.146 A:middle
ever touching your remote.

00:42:20.776 --> 00:42:22.986 A:middle
It is now possible to erase an

00:42:22.986 --> 00:42:24.296 A:middle
Apple TV using Apple

00:42:24.296 --> 00:42:26.796 A:middle
Configurator or MDM and enroll

00:42:26.796 --> 00:42:30.156 A:middle
the Apple TV using DEP and Auto

00:42:30.156 --> 00:42:31.776 A:middle
Advance like Bob talked about

00:42:31.776 --> 00:42:35.066 A:middle
earlier, specify the name of the

00:42:35.066 --> 00:42:37.906 A:middle
Apple TV, prevent the users from

00:42:37.906 --> 00:42:39.446 A:middle
changing the name on the TV,

00:42:40.406 --> 00:42:42.566 A:middle
configure allowed content

00:42:42.566 --> 00:42:44.486 A:middle
restrictions, such as media

00:42:44.486 --> 00:42:47.716 A:middle
ratings, specify the list of

00:42:47.716 --> 00:42:48.956 A:middle
apps that are available on the

00:42:48.956 --> 00:42:51.576 A:middle
TV, and also configure how the

00:42:51.576 --> 00:42:52.926 A:middle
apps are laid out on the Home

00:42:52.926 --> 00:42:54.746 A:middle
screen including folders.

00:42:55.386 --> 00:42:56.036 A:middle
Isn't that great?

00:42:58.736 --> 00:42:59.006 A:middle
Thank you.

00:43:01.836 --> 00:43:03.436 A:middle
Apple TVs are great for

00:43:03.436 --> 00:43:05.166 A:middle
conference rooms and classrooms.

00:43:05.566 --> 00:43:07.346 A:middle
So, we built a new management

00:43:07.346 --> 00:43:09.216 A:middle
feature to put Apple TV into a

00:43:09.216 --> 00:43:11.166 A:middle
mode that we call Conference

00:43:11.166 --> 00:43:11.996 A:middle
Room Display mode.

00:43:12.646 --> 00:43:14.356 A:middle
When in this mode Apple TV can

00:43:14.356 --> 00:43:15.646 A:middle
be configured to display a

00:43:15.776 --> 00:43:17.736 A:middle
custom message onscreen and the

00:43:17.736 --> 00:43:19.836 A:middle
only thing the users can do is

00:43:20.156 --> 00:43:21.466 A:middle
to [inaudible] the TV to share

00:43:21.466 --> 00:43:22.336 A:middle
their displays.

00:43:22.856 --> 00:43:25.266 A:middle
We also added a new AirPlay

00:43:25.266 --> 00:43:27.006 A:middle
Security payload using which

00:43:27.006 --> 00:43:28.566 A:middle
administrators can configure the

00:43:28.656 --> 00:43:30.156 A:middle
type of the security requirement

00:43:30.156 --> 00:43:30.796 A:middle
for AirPlay.

00:43:31.586 --> 00:43:32.566 A:middle
This can be one of three

00:43:32.566 --> 00:43:34.936 A:middle
options, one-time possible, a

00:43:34.936 --> 00:43:37.026 A:middle
passcode every time or even a

00:43:37.026 --> 00:43:38.726 A:middle
custom password which can be

00:43:38.726 --> 00:43:40.126 A:middle
configured using the payload.

00:43:41.116 --> 00:43:42.936 A:middle
We believe this combined with

00:43:43.376 --> 00:43:45.536 A:middle
AirPlay payload on iOS and macOS

00:43:45.866 --> 00:43:47.086 A:middle
gives the administrators the

00:43:47.086 --> 00:43:49.756 A:middle
ability to configure AirPlay

00:43:49.756 --> 00:43:50.896 A:middle
with the greatest security

00:43:50.896 --> 00:43:53.206 A:middle
possible and ease-of-use.

00:43:53.676 --> 00:43:56.816 A:middle
Apple TVs are also great for

00:43:56.816 --> 00:43:59.586 A:middle
kiosks and dashboards, so we

00:43:59.586 --> 00:44:01.026 A:middle
brought over the single app mode

00:43:59.586 --> 00:44:01.026 A:middle
brought over the single app mode

00:44:01.026 --> 00:44:03.356 A:middle
from iOS to tvOS and as you

00:44:03.356 --> 00:44:05.356 A:middle
would expect, this payload can

00:44:05.356 --> 00:44:07.326 A:middle
be used to log a TV to a single

00:44:07.326 --> 00:44:07.556 A:middle
app.

00:44:08.146 --> 00:44:09.526 A:middle
To go along with this, we also

00:44:09.526 --> 00:44:12.026 A:middle
added two new restrictions, one

00:44:12.026 --> 00:44:14.496 A:middle
to disable users from pairing

00:44:14.496 --> 00:44:15.906 A:middle
the remote app on their iOS

00:44:15.906 --> 00:44:18.286 A:middle
devices with a TV and the next

00:44:18.286 --> 00:44:22.426 A:middle
one to disable AirPlay on a TV.

00:44:22.586 --> 00:44:24.046 A:middle
Next, let's talk about some of

00:44:24.046 --> 00:44:25.026 A:middle
the features that are shared

00:44:25.026 --> 00:44:26.526 A:middle
across all the platforms.

00:44:28.486 --> 00:44:32.476 A:middle
VPN IKEv2 and Wi-Fi payloads now

00:44:32.476 --> 00:44:34.136 A:middle
support configuring minimum and

00:44:34.136 --> 00:44:35.766 A:middle
maximum TLS versions.

00:44:36.626 --> 00:44:38.486 A:middle
The install application list is

00:44:38.486 --> 00:44:39.756 A:middle
now consistent on all three

00:44:39.756 --> 00:44:42.276 A:middle
platforms and accurately reports

00:44:42.276 --> 00:44:43.246 A:middle
whether an app is being

00:44:43.246 --> 00:44:44.496 A:middle
installed or updated.

00:44:47.836 --> 00:44:50.706 A:middle
We now support Restart on iOS,

00:44:50.706 --> 00:44:53.686 A:middle
tvOS and macOS and Shut down on

00:44:53.736 --> 00:44:57.146 A:middle
iOS and macOS.

00:44:57.266 --> 00:44:58.866 A:middle
We already have a great support

00:44:58.866 --> 00:45:00.126 A:middle
for test taking apps with

00:44:58.866 --> 00:45:00.126 A:middle
for test taking apps with

00:45:00.126 --> 00:45:01.226 A:middle
automatic assessment

00:45:01.226 --> 00:45:02.046 A:middle
configuration.

00:45:03.376 --> 00:45:04.426 A:middle
I'm happy to announce the

00:45:04.426 --> 00:45:05.466 A:middle
automatic assessment

00:45:05.466 --> 00:45:07.146 A:middle
configuration now includes five

00:45:07.146 --> 00:45:09.306 A:middle
new restrictions without you

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:10.846 A:middle
having to make any changes.

00:45:11.296 --> 00:45:13.416 A:middle
Activity continuation, universal

00:45:13.416 --> 00:45:16.656 A:middle
clipboard, dictation and in the

00:45:16.656 --> 00:45:18.006 A:middle
upcoming release smart

00:45:18.006 --> 00:45:19.436 A:middle
punctuation, and classrooms

00:45:19.436 --> 00:45:20.316 A:middle
screen observation.

00:45:23.076 --> 00:45:24.176 A:middle
These are the set of

00:45:24.176 --> 00:45:26.436 A:middle
restrictions that existed even

00:45:26.436 --> 00:45:27.996 A:middle
before supervision was a thing.

00:45:28.296 --> 00:45:31.176 A:middle
And Todd has been warning you

00:45:31.176 --> 00:45:32.986 A:middle
for the past two years that

00:45:32.986 --> 00:45:33.826 A:middle
these are going to become

00:45:33.826 --> 00:45:35.536 A:middle
supervised only and I get to

00:45:35.536 --> 00:45:36.976 A:middle
tell you when.

00:45:37.936 --> 00:45:40.096 A:middle
Starting 2018 these restrictions

00:45:40.096 --> 00:45:41.426 A:middle
will become supervised only.

00:45:42.056 --> 00:45:43.816 A:middle
With that, please welcome my

00:45:43.816 --> 00:45:45.706 A:middle
colleagues, Graham and John on

00:45:45.706 --> 00:45:47.306 A:middle
stage to demo some of the

00:45:47.306 --> 00:45:48.346 A:middle
features that I've been talking

00:45:48.346 --> 00:45:48.576 A:middle
about.

00:45:48.736 --> 00:45:48.976 A:middle
Thank you.

00:45:49.516 --> 00:45:52.586 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:45:53.086 --> 00:45:54.166 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much Pradhap.

00:45:54.166 --> 00:45:55.176 A:middle
I'm really excited to be here

00:45:55.176 --> 00:45:56.226 A:middle
today to show you guys the

00:45:56.226 --> 00:45:57.566 A:middle
latest management features for

00:45:57.566 --> 00:45:58.306 A:middle
Apple TV.

00:45:58.976 --> 00:46:01.576 A:middle
In tvOS 10.2, we added a ton of

00:45:58.976 --> 00:46:01.576 A:middle
In tvOS 10.2, we added a ton of

00:46:01.576 --> 00:46:02.856 A:middle
great new features for managing

00:46:02.856 --> 00:46:05.776 A:middle
Apple TVs and today with tvOS 11

00:46:05.946 --> 00:46:07.176 A:middle
we're expanding on that feature

00:46:07.176 --> 00:46:07.586 A:middle
set.

00:46:08.036 --> 00:46:09.256 A:middle
While our Apple TV is currently

00:46:09.256 --> 00:46:11.216 A:middle
booting so let's set the scene.

00:46:11.546 --> 00:46:12.736 A:middle
It's summer vacation and you've

00:46:12.736 --> 00:46:13.776 A:middle
just received your order of

00:46:13.776 --> 00:46:15.356 A:middle
Apple TVs and it's time to get

00:46:15.356 --> 00:46:16.626 A:middle
them configured for the upcoming

00:46:16.626 --> 00:46:17.266 A:middle
school year.

00:46:18.106 --> 00:46:19.486 A:middle
I've already set up a default

00:46:19.486 --> 00:46:21.276 A:middle
MDM server in Apple School

00:46:21.276 --> 00:46:22.816 A:middle
Manager so my devices have

00:46:22.816 --> 00:46:24.306 A:middle
already appeared in my MDM

00:46:24.306 --> 00:46:24.726 A:middle
server.

00:46:25.666 --> 00:46:26.816 A:middle
I've also gone ahead and

00:46:26.816 --> 00:46:27.686 A:middle
configured the enrollment

00:46:27.686 --> 00:46:28.676 A:middle
options that I'll want for

00:46:28.676 --> 00:46:30.576 A:middle
today's demo, including the auto

00:46:30.576 --> 00:46:32.506 A:middle
advance key and nonremovable

00:46:32.506 --> 00:46:33.066 A:middle
MDM.

00:46:33.466 --> 00:46:35.126 A:middle
I've also added the device to a

00:46:35.126 --> 00:46:36.506 A:middle
group that contains some of the

00:46:36.506 --> 00:46:37.486 A:middle
settings that we're going to use

00:46:37.486 --> 00:46:38.126 A:middle
today as well.

00:46:38.596 --> 00:46:39.546 A:middle
Those include a Home screen

00:46:39.546 --> 00:46:41.186 A:middle
layout payload, we've hidden

00:46:41.186 --> 00:46:42.156 A:middle
some of the default system

00:46:42.156 --> 00:46:44.286 A:middle
applications and installed some

00:46:44.286 --> 00:46:45.106 A:middle
enterprise apps.

00:46:45.566 --> 00:46:46.846 A:middle
So, it looks like we're still

00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:48.456 A:middle
booting up here so let's talk

00:46:48.456 --> 00:46:49.926 A:middle
about what's going on behind the

00:46:49.926 --> 00:46:50.456 A:middle
scenes.

00:46:51.216 --> 00:46:52.266 A:middle
Once the device reaches the

00:46:52.266 --> 00:46:53.766 A:middle
setup screen it will begin its

00:46:53.766 --> 00:46:55.056 A:middle
activation process if it's

00:46:55.056 --> 00:46:55.986 A:middle
connected to ethernet.

00:46:56.976 --> 00:46:58.226 A:middle
The device will check in with

00:46:58.226 --> 00:46:59.456 A:middle
the activation server and if

00:46:59.456 --> 00:47:00.396 A:middle
it's enrolled in the Device

00:46:59.456 --> 00:47:00.396 A:middle
it's enrolled in the Device

00:47:00.396 --> 00:47:01.796 A:middle
Enrollment Program it will

00:47:01.796 --> 00:47:03.256 A:middle
download the cloud configuration

00:47:03.256 --> 00:47:05.146 A:middle
file and look for that auto

00:47:05.146 --> 00:47:05.846 A:middle
advance key.

00:47:06.406 --> 00:47:07.996 A:middle
If the auto advance key is found

00:47:08.316 --> 00:47:09.536 A:middle
the device will begin its setup

00:47:09.536 --> 00:47:11.986 A:middle
process and enroll in MDM.

00:47:12.446 --> 00:47:13.856 A:middle
So, it looks like we've just got

00:47:13.856 --> 00:47:14.976 A:middle
another couple of seconds here

00:47:14.976 --> 00:47:16.236 A:middle
before this reaches the screen.

00:47:16.506 --> 00:47:17.406 A:middle
So, I hope everyone's having a

00:47:17.406 --> 00:47:18.766 A:middle
fantastic conference so far,

00:47:19.266 --> 00:47:19.916 A:middle
woohoo.

00:47:20.936 --> 00:47:22.626 A:middle
So, we can see that our Home

00:47:22.626 --> 00:47:23.536 A:middle
screen layout payload has been

00:47:23.536 --> 00:47:25.296 A:middle
applied so we've got some of our

00:47:25.296 --> 00:47:26.136 A:middle
default apps they're in a

00:47:26.136 --> 00:47:27.696 A:middle
folder, most of the default

00:47:27.696 --> 00:47:28.886 A:middle
system applications have been

00:47:28.886 --> 00:47:31.076 A:middle
hidden, and we've got some

00:47:31.076 --> 00:47:31.956 A:middle
enterprise apps that have been

00:47:31.956 --> 00:47:32.366 A:middle
installed.

00:47:32.366 --> 00:47:34.106 A:middle
So, now that we're ready to go

00:47:34.426 --> 00:47:35.746 A:middle
let's take a look at the new

00:47:35.746 --> 00:47:37.046 A:middle
single app mode payload.

00:47:37.676 --> 00:47:38.726 A:middle
We'll go ahead and launch one of

00:47:38.726 --> 00:47:39.656 A:middle
our enterprise apps in the

00:47:39.656 --> 00:47:40.496 A:middle
single app mode.

00:47:40.896 --> 00:47:42.146 A:middle
For today's demo, we've got a

00:47:42.246 --> 00:47:43.576 A:middle
foreign currency exchange app

00:47:43.576 --> 00:47:44.796 A:middle
that shows us the exchange rate

00:47:44.796 --> 00:47:46.766 A:middle
for the US dollar in various

00:47:46.766 --> 00:47:47.926 A:middle
currencies around the world.

00:47:48.896 --> 00:47:49.706 A:middle
It looks like the Canadian

00:47:49.706 --> 00:47:50.936 A:middle
dollar is doing pretty great

00:47:51.566 --> 00:47:52.046 A:middle
today.

00:47:52.986 --> 00:47:53.616 A:middle
Yeah, Canada.

00:47:53.696 --> 00:47:56.126 A:middle
All right, but now let's say

00:47:56.126 --> 00:47:57.776 A:middle
that we're managing Apple TVs in

00:47:57.776 --> 00:47:58.736 A:middle
different countries around the

00:47:58.736 --> 00:48:00.266 A:middle
world, they'll likely want to

00:47:58.736 --> 00:48:00.266 A:middle
world, they'll likely want to

00:48:00.266 --> 00:48:01.266 A:middle
see that exchange rate in their

00:48:01.266 --> 00:48:02.096 A:middle
local currency.

00:48:02.646 --> 00:48:03.916 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and install a

00:48:03.916 --> 00:48:05.626 A:middle
managed app configuration and

00:48:05.626 --> 00:48:06.376 A:middle
see what happens.

00:48:06.996 --> 00:48:08.866 A:middle
Now you'll notice that we're in

00:48:08.866 --> 00:48:09.986 A:middle
Canadian dollars for our base

00:48:09.986 --> 00:48:10.976 A:middle
currency, pretty cool hey?

00:48:11.516 --> 00:48:15.586 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:48:16.086 --> 00:48:17.456 A:middle
All right, next let's take a

00:48:17.456 --> 00:48:18.416 A:middle
look at the conference room

00:48:18.416 --> 00:48:19.476 A:middle
display mode payload.

00:48:20.046 --> 00:48:21.316 A:middle
So, perhaps this Apple TV is

00:48:21.316 --> 00:48:22.626 A:middle
being used in a conference room

00:48:23.136 --> 00:48:24.526 A:middle
where we're doing presentations

00:48:24.526 --> 00:48:25.466 A:middle
on a regular basis.

00:48:25.766 --> 00:48:27.096 A:middle
We can now remotely place the

00:48:27.096 --> 00:48:28.206 A:middle
Apple TV in conference room

00:48:28.206 --> 00:48:29.646 A:middle
display mode and as you can see,

00:48:29.646 --> 00:48:30.866 A:middle
we can add a custom message for

00:48:30.866 --> 00:48:31.316 A:middle
our users.

00:48:31.586 --> 00:48:34.126 A:middle
Hello WWDC 2017, wooo.

00:48:37.046 --> 00:48:38.376 A:middle
You'll notice that the

00:48:38.376 --> 00:48:39.896 A:middle
conference room display mode has

00:48:39.896 --> 00:48:41.486 A:middle
integrated seamlessly with

00:48:41.486 --> 00:48:43.736 A:middle
single app mode payload, meaning

00:48:43.736 --> 00:48:45.006 A:middle
that we can [inaudible] a room

00:48:45.006 --> 00:48:46.466 A:middle
at any given time with either

00:48:46.466 --> 00:48:46.956 A:middle
payload.

00:48:47.906 --> 00:48:49.506 A:middle
Finally, let's take a look at

00:48:49.506 --> 00:48:50.886 A:middle
the AirPlay security payload

00:48:50.886 --> 00:48:52.446 A:middle
that we added in tvOS 11.

00:48:53.206 --> 00:48:54.886 A:middle
We've got an iPad here running

00:48:55.136 --> 00:48:56.936 A:middle
iOS, so we're going to go ahead

00:48:56.936 --> 00:48:58.336 A:middle
and start an AirPlay session

00:48:58.446 --> 00:48:59.376 A:middle
with this Apple TV.

00:49:00.086 --> 00:49:01.026 A:middle
You'll notice that we are

00:49:01.026 --> 00:49:02.206 A:middle
prompted for the password that

00:49:02.206 --> 00:49:03.636 A:middle
we defined in the AirPlay

00:49:03.636 --> 00:49:04.686 A:middle
security payload.

00:49:05.076 --> 00:49:06.376 A:middle
While this is fantastic from a

00:49:06.376 --> 00:49:08.386 A:middle
security perspective it's not as

00:49:08.386 --> 00:49:09.916 A:middle
easy as we'd like for our users.

00:49:10.716 --> 00:49:12.576 A:middle
So now we've got a second iPad

00:49:12.576 --> 00:49:13.566 A:middle
here that's got the AirPlay

00:49:13.566 --> 00:49:15.516 A:middle
security or the AirPlay payload

00:49:15.516 --> 00:49:17.256 A:middle
installed on it so let's see how

00:49:17.256 --> 00:49:18.506 A:middle
much easier we can make this for

00:49:18.506 --> 00:49:19.046 A:middle
our users.

00:49:19.766 --> 00:49:21.166 A:middle
So, now when we start our

00:49:21.166 --> 00:49:22.856 A:middle
AirPlay session you'll notice

00:49:22.856 --> 00:49:24.396 A:middle
that this is the only Apple TV

00:49:24.396 --> 00:49:26.196 A:middle
that we can AirPlay to and we

00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:27.056 A:middle
weren't prompted for the

00:49:27.056 --> 00:49:27.606 A:middle
password.

00:49:28.156 --> 00:49:29.196 A:middle
This makes for a seamless

00:49:29.196 --> 00:49:30.556 A:middle
experience for our users, it is

00:49:30.556 --> 00:49:31.976 A:middle
also very secure for our

00:49:31.976 --> 00:49:32.706 A:middle
institution.

00:49:33.146 --> 00:49:34.426 A:middle
And with that, I'd like to thank

00:49:34.426 --> 00:49:35.396 A:middle
you very much for your time

00:49:35.396 --> 00:49:36.676 A:middle
today and I'll turn the stage

00:49:36.676 --> 00:49:37.486 A:middle
back over to Todd.

00:49:37.786 --> 00:49:41.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Todd.

00:49:44.066 --> 00:49:45.036 A:middle
Thank you very much Graham and

00:49:45.036 --> 00:49:45.326 A:middle
Todd.

00:49:47.956 --> 00:49:50.536 A:middle
So, one reason we're so excited

00:49:50.536 --> 00:49:52.366 A:middle
about all these new features is

00:49:52.536 --> 00:49:53.866 A:middle
what some of you have already

00:49:53.866 --> 00:49:55.286 A:middle
done with them and we want to

00:49:55.286 --> 00:49:56.646 A:middle
just make it even easier for you

00:49:56.646 --> 00:49:58.746 A:middle
to do those things better and we

00:49:58.746 --> 00:50:00.156 A:middle
can't wait to see what you can

00:49:58.746 --> 00:50:00.156 A:middle
can't wait to see what you can

00:50:00.156 --> 00:50:00.906 A:middle
come up with next.

00:50:01.236 --> 00:50:02.696 A:middle
I want to highlight one example

00:50:02.696 --> 00:50:04.576 A:middle
that UC San Diego did at their

00:50:04.576 --> 00:50:06.436 A:middle
new Jacobs Medical Center where

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:08.176 A:middle
they provide each patient when

00:50:08.176 --> 00:50:09.356 A:middle
they enter the hospital with an

00:50:09.566 --> 00:50:11.986 A:middle
iPad in their hospital room that

00:50:11.986 --> 00:50:12.966 A:middle
they can use to monitor their

00:50:12.966 --> 00:50:14.876 A:middle
care, as well as manage the

00:50:14.876 --> 00:50:16.036 A:middle
entertainment options in the

00:50:16.036 --> 00:50:17.956 A:middle
room on Apple TV.

00:50:19.176 --> 00:50:20.816 A:middle
Now with that last feature that

00:50:20.816 --> 00:50:22.716 A:middle
Graham just showed they can

00:50:22.716 --> 00:50:24.646 A:middle
securely connect pairs of

00:50:24.826 --> 00:50:26.946 A:middle
patient iPad and Apple TV so the

00:50:26.946 --> 00:50:28.256 A:middle
patient can't inadvertently

00:50:28.256 --> 00:50:29.366 A:middle
interfere with the patient in

00:50:29.366 --> 00:50:30.066 A:middle
the next room.

00:50:30.656 --> 00:50:32.066 A:middle
We're so excited about

00:50:32.066 --> 00:50:33.416 A:middle
deployments like these that can

00:50:33.416 --> 00:50:35.066 A:middle
really improve people's lives by

00:50:35.066 --> 00:50:36.456 A:middle
giving them more control over

00:50:36.456 --> 00:50:37.716 A:middle
their experience in a hospital

00:50:37.996 --> 00:50:39.106 A:middle
and we can't wait to see what

00:50:39.106 --> 00:50:40.076 A:middle
else you can do with them.

00:50:40.846 --> 00:50:42.046 A:middle
So that concludes our management

00:50:42.046 --> 00:50:42.506 A:middle
section.

00:50:43.216 --> 00:50:44.686 A:middle
So, let's turn to a quick update

00:50:44.686 --> 00:50:45.986 A:middle
on Apple's device management

00:50:45.986 --> 00:50:46.386 A:middle
tools.

00:50:47.586 --> 00:50:49.916 A:middle
Of course, Apple Configurator

00:50:49.916 --> 00:50:51.336 A:middle
and Profile Manager which we've

00:50:51.336 --> 00:50:53.086 A:middle
updated this in seeds this week

00:50:53.306 --> 00:50:54.796 A:middle
support all these new features.

00:50:55.406 --> 00:50:56.556 A:middle
And I'm going to talk a bit in

00:50:56.556 --> 00:50:57.416 A:middle
more detail about those

00:50:57.416 --> 00:50:58.956 A:middle
classroom and content caching in

00:50:58.956 --> 00:50:59.386 A:middle
a moment.

00:51:00.006 --> 00:51:01.336 A:middle
But I also wanted to mention

00:51:01.336 --> 00:51:02.486 A:middle
that we have created a new

00:51:02.486 --> 00:51:04.386 A:middle
roster simulator as a complement

00:51:04.386 --> 00:51:06.446 A:middle
to our existing DEP and VPP

00:51:06.446 --> 00:51:08.786 A:middle
simulators that help MDM vendors

00:51:08.786 --> 00:51:10.686 A:middle
test their implementation of our

00:51:10.686 --> 00:51:12.866 A:middle
APIs for our deployment

00:51:12.866 --> 00:51:13.396 A:middle
services.

00:51:13.866 --> 00:51:15.066 A:middle
The roster simulator will allow

00:51:15.066 --> 00:51:16.436 A:middle
you to do that for Apple School

00:51:16.436 --> 00:51:18.226 A:middle
Manager's APIs for obtaining

00:51:18.726 --> 00:51:20.846 A:middle
accounts and class information.

00:51:21.436 --> 00:51:22.886 A:middle
So, we will be posting those

00:51:22.886 --> 00:51:25.026 A:middle
very soon, we encourage you to

00:51:25.076 --> 00:51:26.466 A:middle
download the roster simulator

00:51:26.466 --> 00:51:27.806 A:middle
and the updated versions of the

00:51:27.806 --> 00:51:29.946 A:middle
DEP and VPP simulators to make

00:51:29.946 --> 00:51:31.296 A:middle
sure that your MDM solutions

00:51:31.586 --> 00:51:32.696 A:middle
integrate really well with our

00:51:32.696 --> 00:51:33.716 A:middle
deployment services.

00:51:35.126 --> 00:51:36.356 A:middle
So, this spring we shipped

00:51:36.356 --> 00:51:39.176 A:middle
Classroom 2 which had a really

00:51:39.276 --> 00:51:40.766 A:middle
critical new feature to make the

00:51:40.766 --> 00:51:42.326 A:middle
audience much wider and allowing

00:51:42.326 --> 00:51:43.396 A:middle
teachers to create their own

00:51:43.396 --> 00:51:44.106 A:middle
classes.

00:51:44.796 --> 00:51:46.126 A:middle
We also now allow teachers and

00:51:46.126 --> 00:51:47.556 A:middle
students to share documents and

00:51:47.556 --> 00:51:48.456 A:middle
URLs with each other.

00:51:49.326 --> 00:51:51.336 A:middle
And of particular importance

00:51:51.336 --> 00:51:52.546 A:middle
when the teacher needs a bit of

00:51:52.546 --> 00:51:54.996 A:middle
peace and quiet feature can now

00:51:54.996 --> 00:51:56.176 A:middle
mute the student devices.

00:51:57.456 --> 00:51:59.396 A:middle
Earlier this week we released or

00:51:59.396 --> 00:52:02.286 A:middle
we seeded Classroom 2.1 which as

00:51:59.396 --> 00:52:02.286 A:middle
we seeded Classroom 2.1 which as

00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:03.546 A:middle
Pradhap mentioned already, we've

00:52:03.546 --> 00:52:04.866 A:middle
introduced a handful of new

00:52:04.866 --> 00:52:06.216 A:middle
restrictions for supervised

00:52:06.216 --> 00:52:08.526 A:middle
devices that allow schools which

00:52:08.626 --> 00:52:10.226 A:middle
want to use teacher created

00:52:10.226 --> 00:52:11.726 A:middle
classes on their supervised

00:52:11.726 --> 00:52:13.756 A:middle
student iPads to achieve most of

00:52:13.756 --> 00:52:15.446 A:middle
the behavior of managed classes.

00:52:16.676 --> 00:52:18.046 A:middle
And we've also added a new

00:52:18.046 --> 00:52:19.386 A:middle
student activity view that

00:52:19.386 --> 00:52:20.766 A:middle
appears at the end of each class

00:52:20.766 --> 00:52:22.816 A:middle
session and it looks like this.

00:52:23.456 --> 00:52:24.776 A:middle
So, the teacher can get a quick

00:52:24.956 --> 00:52:26.176 A:middle
overview of which apps her

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:28.866 A:middle
students used and most often.

00:52:29.566 --> 00:52:31.276 A:middle
Can easily see which app each

00:52:31.276 --> 00:52:32.246 A:middle
student used and when.

00:52:33.716 --> 00:52:35.676 A:middle
Can look at any documents or

00:52:35.676 --> 00:52:37.236 A:middle
URLs the students shared during

00:52:37.236 --> 00:52:38.066 A:middle
the class session.

00:52:39.506 --> 00:52:41.146 A:middle
And also drill into each student

00:52:41.146 --> 00:52:42.406 A:middle
to see which apps that student

00:52:42.406 --> 00:52:43.096 A:middle
used and when.

00:52:43.896 --> 00:52:47.086 A:middle
So that's Classroom 2.1, try it

00:52:47.086 --> 00:52:47.296 A:middle
out.

00:52:47.766 --> 00:52:49.246 A:middle
Next, content caching.

00:52:49.866 --> 00:52:51.136 A:middle
Now the caching server has been

00:52:51.136 --> 00:52:53.166 A:middle
an important feature for schools

00:52:53.166 --> 00:52:54.816 A:middle
and businesses to optimize their

00:52:54.816 --> 00:52:57.026 A:middle
download bandwidth usage and

00:52:57.026 --> 00:52:58.246 A:middle
it's been part of macOS server

00:52:58.246 --> 00:52:59.906 A:middle
for years so why do I have a new

00:52:59.906 --> 00:53:00.626 A:middle
badge up there?

00:52:59.906 --> 00:53:00.626 A:middle
badge up there?

00:53:01.046 --> 00:53:02.366 A:middle
Well that's because it's now

00:53:02.366 --> 00:53:03.766 A:middle
built right into macOS High

00:53:03.766 --> 00:53:05.706 A:middle
Sierra making it much easier for

00:53:05.706 --> 00:53:07.556 A:middle
it to be used even more commonly

00:53:07.556 --> 00:53:08.606 A:middle
in schools and businesses.

00:53:09.416 --> 00:53:12.536 A:middle
We also now have UI for the

00:53:12.536 --> 00:53:13.836 A:middle
caching server and the new

00:53:13.836 --> 00:53:15.226 A:middle
tether caching service that we

00:53:15.226 --> 00:53:16.786 A:middle
soft launched earlier this

00:53:16.786 --> 00:53:19.456 A:middle
spring in macOS 10.12.4 so that

00:53:19.456 --> 00:53:20.766 A:middle
it would be available in time

00:53:20.766 --> 00:53:21.836 A:middle
for summer's preparations for

00:53:21.836 --> 00:53:22.606 A:middle
the next school year.

00:53:23.036 --> 00:53:24.336 A:middle
But instead of talking about it

00:53:24.336 --> 00:53:25.626 A:middle
more I would love to have Nolan

00:53:25.626 --> 00:53:26.786 A:middle
Astron [phonetic] to come up and

00:53:26.826 --> 00:53:27.706 A:middle
demo it to you.

00:53:27.826 --> 00:53:27.976 A:middle
Nolan.

00:53:28.516 --> 00:53:33.026 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:53:33.526 --> 00:53:36.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm Nolan Astron, I'm a

00:53:36.106 --> 00:53:38.806 A:middle
software engineer at Apple and

00:53:38.806 --> 00:53:41.276 A:middle
today I'm going to demo for you

00:53:41.536 --> 00:53:42.286 A:middle
tethered caching.

00:53:43.186 --> 00:53:45.076 A:middle
Tethered caching has three main

00:53:45.076 --> 00:53:46.596 A:middle
pieces to it.

00:53:46.706 --> 00:53:48.116 A:middle
It provides a wired Internet

00:53:48.116 --> 00:53:49.336 A:middle
connection to all the USB

00:53:49.336 --> 00:53:51.246 A:middle
connected iOS devices, it

00:53:51.246 --> 00:53:52.976 A:middle
instantiates the content caching

00:53:52.976 --> 00:53:54.476 A:middle
service on the Mac, and it

00:53:54.476 --> 00:53:56.266 A:middle
funnels all the network traffic

00:53:56.546 --> 00:53:57.736 A:middle
of those tethered devices

00:53:57.926 --> 00:53:59.236 A:middle
through the content caching

00:53:59.276 --> 00:54:00.466 A:middle
service when downloading

00:53:59.276 --> 00:54:00.466 A:middle
service when downloading

00:54:00.466 --> 00:54:01.716 A:middle
cachable Apple content.

00:54:03.036 --> 00:54:04.356 A:middle
To enable this feature, you're

00:54:04.356 --> 00:54:06.156 A:middle
going to want to pop into the

00:54:06.156 --> 00:54:07.706 A:middle
sharing pane of System

00:54:07.706 --> 00:54:08.966 A:middle
Preferences and you're going to

00:54:08.966 --> 00:54:10.556 A:middle
want to have the Share Internet

00:54:10.556 --> 00:54:12.806 A:middle
Connection checkbox checked and

00:54:12.806 --> 00:54:14.666 A:middle
the Content Caching checkbox

00:54:14.666 --> 00:54:15.976 A:middle
checked just like I do here.

00:54:16.516 --> 00:54:20.606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:54:21.106 --> 00:54:22.066 A:middle
Those iOS devices they can be

00:54:22.066 --> 00:54:25.016 A:middle
plugged in at any time, but this

00:54:25.016 --> 00:54:26.476 A:middle
feature really shines when those

00:54:26.646 --> 00:54:28.826 A:middle
iOS devices are enrolled in MDM.

00:54:29.246 --> 00:54:30.916 A:middle
When an MDM enrolled iOS device

00:54:30.916 --> 00:54:32.366 A:middle
becomes tethered it

00:54:32.366 --> 00:54:33.946 A:middle
automatically checks in with its

00:54:33.946 --> 00:54:35.826 A:middle
MDM server and sees if it has

00:54:35.826 --> 00:54:37.036 A:middle
any commands to process.

00:54:37.226 --> 00:54:39.876 A:middle
If a particular command requires

00:54:39.876 --> 00:54:41.666 A:middle
the network it's going to use

00:54:41.666 --> 00:54:43.296 A:middle
its USB interface instead of its

00:54:43.296 --> 00:54:45.996 A:middle
Wi-Fi interface when leveraging

00:54:47.676 --> 00:54:48.486 A:middle
the network.

00:54:48.636 --> 00:54:50.916 A:middle
This feature is extremely useful

00:54:51.066 --> 00:54:52.536 A:middle
when provisioning a large number

00:54:52.536 --> 00:54:54.686 A:middle
of iOS devices with overlapping

00:54:54.686 --> 00:54:56.056 A:middle
cachable Apple content.

00:54:56.796 --> 00:54:59.286 A:middle
All right, so in front of me I

00:54:59.286 --> 00:55:01.526 A:middle
have four iPads hooked up to a

00:54:59.286 --> 00:55:01.526 A:middle
have four iPads hooked up to a

00:55:01.526 --> 00:55:02.776 A:middle
tethered caching station.

00:55:03.086 --> 00:55:04.546 A:middle
Eventually I'm going to download

00:55:04.546 --> 00:55:06.536 A:middle
the same app to each one of the

00:55:06.536 --> 00:55:07.156 A:middle
devices.

00:55:08.256 --> 00:55:09.836 A:middle
But while I do the download I'm

00:55:10.036 --> 00:55:11.096 A:middle
going to show you a little tool

00:55:11.096 --> 00:55:12.206 A:middle
that I built that's going to

00:55:12.206 --> 00:55:14.546 A:middle
monitor the network activity of

00:55:14.546 --> 00:55:16.236 A:middle
the Mac's Wi-Fi interface and of

00:55:16.236 --> 00:55:18.106 A:middle
the Mac's USB network

00:55:18.106 --> 00:55:18.746 A:middle
interfaces.

00:55:18.746 --> 00:55:20.276 A:middle
On the left-hand side, you'll

00:55:20.306 --> 00:55:22.246 A:middle
see a meter for Wi-Fi and on the

00:55:22.246 --> 00:55:24.006 A:middle
right-hand side, you will see a

00:55:24.006 --> 00:55:25.566 A:middle
meter for USB network activity.

00:55:26.276 --> 00:55:27.626 A:middle
So right now, I'm going to

00:55:27.626 --> 00:55:29.656 A:middle
download the app to the first

00:55:29.656 --> 00:55:29.976 A:middle
device.

00:55:36.666 --> 00:55:38.756 A:middle
You'll see that both the Wi-Fi

00:55:38.756 --> 00:55:40.766 A:middle
and USB network activity are

00:55:40.766 --> 00:55:42.916 A:middle
required to process that

00:55:42.916 --> 00:55:43.686 A:middle
download command.

00:55:43.686 --> 00:55:45.346 A:middle
The Mac needs to download the

00:55:45.346 --> 00:55:46.666 A:middle
asset from the Internet and it

00:55:46.666 --> 00:55:48.116 A:middle
needs to push it to the device

00:55:48.436 --> 00:55:49.116 A:middle
over USB.

00:55:49.616 --> 00:55:51.036 A:middle
All right, cool.

00:55:51.036 --> 00:55:52.826 A:middle
Well now that the app is cached

00:55:52.826 --> 00:55:54.296 A:middle
I'm going to download the same

00:55:54.296 --> 00:55:55.536 A:middle
app to the remaining three

00:55:55.536 --> 00:55:55.976 A:middle
devices.

00:56:04.056 --> 00:56:05.766 A:middle
Awesome. You'll see that for all

00:56:05.766 --> 00:56:06.966 A:middle
the remaining downloads of that

00:56:06.966 --> 00:56:08.846 A:middle
same app there's no network

00:56:08.846 --> 00:56:10.496 A:middle
activity on the Wi-Fi interface

00:56:10.496 --> 00:56:10.946 A:middle
required.

00:56:10.946 --> 00:56:12.266 A:middle
The Mac already has a cached

00:56:12.266 --> 00:56:14.006 A:middle
copy of it and all it needs to

00:56:14.006 --> 00:56:15.806 A:middle
do is push that cached version

00:56:16.216 --> 00:56:17.506 A:middle
to the devices over USB.

00:56:17.506 --> 00:56:20.436 A:middle
And just to be clear, it's not

00:56:20.436 --> 00:56:22.476 A:middle
required that one iPad download

00:56:22.476 --> 00:56:23.866 A:middle
the app before any other ones

00:56:23.866 --> 00:56:25.986 A:middle
that was done strictly for demo

00:56:25.986 --> 00:56:26.616 A:middle
purposes.

00:56:27.096 --> 00:56:28.266 A:middle
So why are you going to like

00:56:28.266 --> 00:56:28.806 A:middle
this feature?

00:56:28.906 --> 00:56:30.296 A:middle
Well we think you're going to

00:56:30.296 --> 00:56:31.446 A:middle
like the tethered part of

00:56:31.446 --> 00:56:32.756 A:middle
tethered caching because it's

00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:34.346 A:middle
going to move the network

00:56:34.346 --> 00:56:35.566 A:middle
bandwidth required for

00:56:35.566 --> 00:56:36.876 A:middle
provisioning a large number of

00:56:36.876 --> 00:56:38.746 A:middle
devices off your Wi-Fi network

00:56:39.186 --> 00:56:40.686 A:middle
leaving it usable for the rest

00:56:40.686 --> 00:56:41.596 A:middle
of the connected clients.

00:56:41.946 --> 00:56:42.826 A:middle
And we think you're going to

00:56:42.826 --> 00:56:43.896 A:middle
like the caching part of

00:56:43.896 --> 00:56:45.166 A:middle
tethered caching as it will

00:56:45.166 --> 00:56:46.656 A:middle
significantly reduce the amount

00:56:46.656 --> 00:56:47.896 A:middle
of bandwidth necessary to

00:56:48.016 --> 00:56:49.856 A:middle
provision your iOS devices.

00:56:50.326 --> 00:56:51.436 A:middle
Thank you for watching and I'm

00:56:51.436 --> 00:56:52.766 A:middle
going to hand the stage back to

00:56:52.766 --> 00:56:52.976 A:middle
Todd.

00:56:53.516 --> 00:56:59.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:57:00.046 --> 00:57:00.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much Nolan.

00:57:00.936 --> 00:57:02.546 A:middle
I do want to apologize that we

00:57:02.546 --> 00:57:04.266 A:middle
forgot to install the Siri

00:57:04.266 --> 00:57:05.726 A:middle
profanity filter restriction on

00:57:05.726 --> 00:57:08.006 A:middle
this session, but we'll take

00:57:08.006 --> 00:57:10.626 A:middle
care of that.

00:57:10.626 --> 00:57:12.836 A:middle
So that brings us to the end of

00:57:12.836 --> 00:57:14.566 A:middle
our tools update and I just want

00:57:14.566 --> 00:57:17.176 A:middle
to quickly sum up as we wrap up

00:57:17.176 --> 00:57:18.676 A:middle
our time together with a couple

00:57:18.676 --> 00:57:20.066 A:middle
of notes for app developers.

00:57:20.686 --> 00:57:22.336 A:middle
Now that we support managed app

00:57:22.336 --> 00:57:24.426 A:middle
configuration for tvOS apps too,

00:57:24.776 --> 00:57:26.566 A:middle
please make sure your apps are

00:57:26.566 --> 00:57:27.306 A:middle
supported.

00:57:28.376 --> 00:57:29.516 A:middle
For those of you who would like

00:57:29.516 --> 00:57:30.956 A:middle
to sell a lot of copies of your

00:57:30.956 --> 00:57:33.686 A:middle
apps into education, make sure

00:57:33.686 --> 00:57:34.856 A:middle
that they're good customers for

00:57:34.856 --> 00:57:37.386 A:middle
Shared iPad by storing all the

00:57:37.386 --> 00:57:39.446 A:middle
data that you want to persist in

00:57:39.446 --> 00:57:40.996 A:middle
the cloud, whether it's iCloud

00:57:40.996 --> 00:57:42.716 A:middle
or your own third-party cloud

00:57:42.716 --> 00:57:44.456 A:middle
solution and don't rely on

00:57:44.456 --> 00:57:46.056 A:middle
backup or local data which won't

00:57:46.136 --> 00:57:47.756 A:middle
survive logging into a different

00:57:47.756 --> 00:57:48.296 A:middle
device.

00:57:48.856 --> 00:57:50.166 A:middle
Once you've done this work you

00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:51.586 A:middle
can also take advantage of the

00:57:51.586 --> 00:57:53.496 A:middle
option in iTunes Connect to mark

00:57:53.496 --> 00:57:55.086 A:middle
your app as optimized for Shared

00:57:55.086 --> 00:57:56.676 A:middle
iPad again, making it more

00:57:56.896 --> 00:57:58.616 A:middle
interesting to education

00:57:58.616 --> 00:58:00.036 A:middle
customers who might want to buy

00:57:58.616 --> 00:58:00.036 A:middle
customers who might want to buy

00:58:00.096 --> 00:58:01.316 A:middle
hundreds or thousands of copies

00:58:01.316 --> 00:58:02.146 A:middle
of it.

00:58:02.966 --> 00:58:05.436 A:middle
Finally, if your app has a

00:58:05.436 --> 00:58:06.876 A:middle
strong dependency on network

00:58:06.876 --> 00:58:09.886 A:middle
traffic and latency, take

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:11.286 A:middle
advantage of some of the Cisco

00:58:11.286 --> 00:58:12.776 A:middle
Fastlane options to optimize

00:58:12.776 --> 00:58:15.206 A:middle
that traffic and there's a lab

00:58:15.206 --> 00:58:16.846 A:middle
tomorrow that I will highlight

00:58:16.846 --> 00:58:17.826 A:middle
in a moment where you can get

00:58:17.826 --> 00:58:18.396 A:middle
help with that.

00:58:19.946 --> 00:58:21.726 A:middle
For MDM vendors, of course we

00:58:21.726 --> 00:58:22.656 A:middle
want you to support all these

00:58:22.656 --> 00:58:24.256 A:middle
new features and we'll be in the

00:58:24.256 --> 00:58:26.016 A:middle
lab after this to help you with

00:58:26.016 --> 00:58:26.656 A:middle
any questions you have.

00:58:26.656 --> 00:58:28.266 A:middle
I would also like to encourage

00:58:28.266 --> 00:58:29.626 A:middle
you to adopt all the security

00:58:29.626 --> 00:58:30.726 A:middle
enhancements that Bob talked

00:58:30.726 --> 00:58:31.816 A:middle
about during the enrollment

00:58:31.816 --> 00:58:32.316 A:middle
section.

00:58:33.996 --> 00:58:35.256 A:middle
For administrators, take

00:58:35.256 --> 00:58:36.476 A:middle
advantage of all these great new

00:58:36.476 --> 00:58:38.086 A:middle
capabilities to build compelling

00:58:38.086 --> 00:58:40.486 A:middle
new deployments that link iPads

00:58:40.486 --> 00:58:42.976 A:middle
and Macs and Apple TV just like

00:58:42.976 --> 00:58:44.926 A:middle
UCSD has and come up with some

00:58:44.926 --> 00:58:46.256 A:middle
amazing things that no one else

00:58:46.256 --> 00:58:46.816 A:middle
has thought of.

00:58:48.556 --> 00:58:51.356 A:middle
And finally, be ready, yes

00:58:51.356 --> 00:58:52.616 A:middle
Pradhap stole my thunder, but

00:58:52.616 --> 00:58:54.296 A:middle
next you need to be ready for

00:58:54.296 --> 00:58:55.426 A:middle
those restrictions to be

00:58:55.426 --> 00:58:57.296 A:middle
supervised only and honored only

00:58:57.296 --> 00:58:58.596 A:middle
on supervised devices.

00:59:01.336 --> 00:59:02.246 A:middle
So, we had a lot more

00:59:02.246 --> 00:59:04.036 A:middle
information, documentation, help

00:59:04.066 --> 00:59:06.716 A:middle
guides for the tools, all kinds

00:59:06.716 --> 00:59:07.866 A:middle
of information at the session

00:59:07.866 --> 00:59:09.536 A:middle
link, session 304.

00:59:11.456 --> 00:59:12.496 A:middle
We have a couple of sessions

00:59:12.496 --> 00:59:13.976 A:middle
still happening this week that

00:59:13.976 --> 00:59:14.996 A:middle
you might be interested in.

00:59:16.016 --> 00:59:18.036 A:middle
There's a What's New with Screen

00:59:18.036 --> 00:59:20.156 A:middle
Recording tomorrow morning that

00:59:20.156 --> 00:59:21.846 A:middle
if you're building tools for

00:59:21.846 --> 00:59:24.256 A:middle
remotely assisting customers

00:59:24.256 --> 00:59:25.056 A:middle
that there's some very

00:59:25.056 --> 00:59:26.326 A:middle
interesting technology in the

00:59:26.326 --> 00:59:27.576 A:middle
new version of ReplayKit.

00:59:28.446 --> 00:59:29.776 A:middle
And we talked a little bit about

00:59:29.776 --> 00:59:31.186 A:middle
kiosk and assessment apps, but

00:59:31.186 --> 00:59:32.246 A:middle
there's a whole session about

00:59:32.246 --> 00:59:33.336 A:middle
that tomorrow afternoon if

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:34.246 A:middle
you're interested in that, I

00:59:34.516 --> 00:59:35.666 A:middle
encourage you to check that out.

00:59:36.296 --> 00:59:37.426 A:middle
And with that, I will thank you

00:59:37.426 --> 00:59:38.866 A:middle
very much for your attention and

00:59:38.866 --> 00:59:39.926 A:middle
hope you enjoy the rest of the

00:59:39.926 --> 00:59:40.046 A:middle
WWDC.

00:59:40.046 --> 00:59:40.946 A:middle
Thank you very much.
