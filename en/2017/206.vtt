00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:28.126 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:29.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:32.256 A:middle
Welcome to session 206,

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:34.216 A:middle
Introducing Password Autofill

00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:34.866 A:middle
for Apps.

00:00:35.596 --> 00:00:37.276 A:middle
My name is Ricky Mondello.

00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:39.246 A:middle
And I am thrilled to be able to

00:00:39.246 --> 00:00:40.376 A:middle
tell you about Password

00:00:40.376 --> 00:00:43.166 A:middle
Autofill, a new feature in iOS

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.476 A:middle
11 that puts passwords that your

00:00:45.476 --> 00:00:47.146 A:middle
users have already saved in

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:49.486 A:middle
Safari and in iCloud Keychain

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:51.826 A:middle
directly on the keyboard within

00:00:51.826 --> 00:00:53.766 A:middle
your apps to make logging in

00:00:54.026 --> 00:00:54.816 A:middle
super simple.

00:00:56.536 --> 00:00:58.606 A:middle
We made Password Autofill

00:00:58.916 --> 00:01:00.196 A:middle
because logging into apps is

00:00:58.916 --> 00:01:00.196 A:middle
because logging into apps is

00:01:00.196 --> 00:01:00.436 A:middle
hard.

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:02.276 A:middle
It's a source of friction.

00:01:03.286 --> 00:01:05.236 A:middle
Personally, when I've downloaded

00:01:05.236 --> 00:01:06.826 A:middle
a new app from the Store and

00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:07.986 A:middle
I've seen the login screen,

00:01:08.736 --> 00:01:10.276 A:middle
sometimes I've just switched

00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:12.056 A:middle
back to Safari where I knew I

00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:13.146 A:middle
was already logged into the

00:01:13.146 --> 00:01:13.946 A:middle
app's website.

00:01:14.796 --> 00:01:16.216 A:middle
But beyond an inconvenience for

00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:18.576 A:middle
me, for so many people any

00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:19.646 A:middle
experience dealing with

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.516 A:middle
passwords is a source of real

00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:23.586 A:middle
frustration or even panic.

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.846 A:middle
So the truth is, although having

00:01:26.846 --> 00:01:29.226 A:middle
to log into your apps is really

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:30.926 A:middle
important, it is a source of

00:01:30.926 --> 00:01:32.316 A:middle
friction that can lead to users

00:01:32.316 --> 00:01:33.866 A:middle
abandoning your app.

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:34.876 A:middle
And none of us want that to

00:01:34.876 --> 00:01:35.246 A:middle
happen.

00:01:35.396 --> 00:01:36.496 A:middle
You make awesome apps.

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:38.696 A:middle
We want users to use them.

00:01:39.206 --> 00:01:42.416 A:middle
Fortunately, in iOS 11 Password

00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:43.306 A:middle
Autofill can help.

00:01:44.306 --> 00:01:44.896 A:middle
Let me explain.

00:01:45.426 --> 00:01:50.176 A:middle
iOS and MacOS have a password

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:51.316 A:middle
manager that's built in,

00:01:51.426 --> 00:01:52.736 A:middle
integrated into Safari.

00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:55.146 A:middle
And you've probably seen it

00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:55.546 A:middle
before.

00:01:56.076 --> 00:01:58.316 A:middle
When you're logging into a

00:01:58.316 --> 00:02:00.226 A:middle
website, it offers to save your

00:01:58.316 --> 00:02:00.226 A:middle
website, it offers to save your

00:02:00.226 --> 00:02:00.906 A:middle
passwords.

00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:03.906 A:middle
And the next time that you come

00:02:03.906 --> 00:02:06.106 A:middle
back to that website, it fills

00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:07.826 A:middle
them automatically for you to

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:09.876 A:middle
make logging in really easy.

00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:11.796 A:middle
And I want you to know that

00:02:11.796 --> 00:02:13.456 A:middle
Safari takes the security of

00:02:13.456 --> 00:02:14.926 A:middle
users' passwords extremely

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:15.496 A:middle
seriously.

00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:18.136 A:middle
If the user has saved a password

00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:20.436 A:middle
for your website, Safari will

00:02:20.436 --> 00:02:22.326 A:middle
only ever fill that password on

00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:22.996 A:middle
your website.

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:25.716 A:middle
Passwords for your website won't

00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:26.886 A:middle
be offered on any other

00:02:26.886 --> 00:02:27.476 A:middle
websites.

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:31.106 A:middle
And of course, if the user wants

00:02:31.106 --> 00:02:32.096 A:middle
to look up one of their

00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:34.896 A:middle
passwords on a device, viewing

00:02:34.896 --> 00:02:36.136 A:middle
the passwords requires them to

00:02:36.136 --> 00:02:38.056 A:middle
authenticate, either with Touch

00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:40.146 A:middle
ID or with their passcode.

00:02:40.816 --> 00:02:43.236 A:middle
The point is, iOS keeps these

00:02:43.236 --> 00:02:45.216 A:middle
passwords secure on device.

00:02:46.476 --> 00:02:49.346 A:middle
And of course, iOS synchs all of

00:02:49.346 --> 00:02:50.906 A:middle
these passwords across a user's

00:02:50.906 --> 00:02:52.916 A:middle
devices using iCloud Keychain.

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:54.946 A:middle
And this makes it super easy to

00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:56.846 A:middle
log in across multiple devices.

00:02:57.286 --> 00:03:00.306 A:middle
And this, too, is secure.

00:02:57.286 --> 00:03:00.306 A:middle
And this, too, is secure.

00:03:01.356 --> 00:03:02.446 A:middle
We actually have a really

00:03:02.446 --> 00:03:04.216 A:middle
approachable white paper on

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:06.296 A:middle
Apple.com that describes the

00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:08.036 A:middle
security model of iCloud

00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:08.476 A:middle
Keychain.

00:03:09.016 --> 00:03:10.316 A:middle
And it goes into a great amount

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:12.596 A:middle
of detail about how and why

00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:14.936 A:middle
Apple cannot see a user's

00:03:14.936 --> 00:03:17.986 A:middle
synched passwords, but it still

00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:19.496 A:middle
makes them available on all the

00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:19.996 A:middle
devices.

00:03:22.696 --> 00:03:24.666 A:middle
Safari AutoFill and iCloud

00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:26.486 A:middle
Keychain are built directly into

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:27.486 A:middle
iOS and MacOS.

00:03:28.336 --> 00:03:30.266 A:middle
Safari AutoFill is enabled by

00:03:30.266 --> 00:03:32.036 A:middle
default for all users.

00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:33.986 A:middle
And every user is prompted to

00:03:33.986 --> 00:03:37.016 A:middle
turn on iCloud Keychain when

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.176 A:middle
they set up a new device.

00:03:39.456 --> 00:03:41.656 A:middle
These features are extremely

00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:42.146 A:middle
popular.

00:03:42.776 --> 00:03:43.986 A:middle
Lots of your users have

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:45.376 A:middle
passwords saved in iCloud

00:03:45.376 --> 00:03:46.806 A:middle
Keychain and Safari AutoFill.

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:50.526 A:middle
And what iOS 11 does is it takes

00:03:50.526 --> 00:03:52.076 A:middle
these passwords that already

00:03:52.076 --> 00:03:54.136 A:middle
saved in the Keychain and makes

00:03:54.136 --> 00:03:55.716 A:middle
them available on the keyboard

00:03:56.106 --> 00:03:57.176 A:middle
within your apps.

00:03:57.896 --> 00:03:58.756 A:middle
And I think the best way to

00:03:58.756 --> 00:04:00.036 A:middle
understand this is to see it.

00:03:58.756 --> 00:04:00.036 A:middle
understand this is to see it.

00:04:00.686 --> 00:04:05.000 A:middle
So let's start off with a demo.

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:12.566 A:middle
So, what I have right here is

00:04:12.566 --> 00:04:14.256 A:middle
Shiny, which is a demo app.

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:15.956 A:middle
And it's personally my favorite

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:17.926 A:middle
demo app for logging in and

00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:19.106 A:middle
seeing a picture of something

00:04:19.106 --> 00:04:20.216 A:middle
that's pleasant every single

00:04:20.216 --> 00:04:20.426 A:middle
day.

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.366 A:middle
So I'm going to open up this

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:22.616 A:middle
app.

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:25.096 A:middle
And it has a very standard login

00:04:25.096 --> 00:04:26.516 A:middle
screen, like many of your apps

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.246 A:middle
do, with a username and a

00:04:28.246 --> 00:04:28.986 A:middle
password field.

00:04:30.116 --> 00:04:31.366 A:middle
So like any user would, I'm

00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:32.856 A:middle
going to tap into the username

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:33.196 A:middle
field.

00:04:33.696 --> 00:04:35.486 A:middle
And one of the first things

00:04:35.486 --> 00:04:37.386 A:middle
you'll probably notice is that

00:04:37.386 --> 00:04:38.966 A:middle
directly above the keyboard

00:04:39.576 --> 00:04:40.506 A:middle
there's the QuickType bar.

00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:42.076 A:middle
And the QuickType bar is

00:04:42.076 --> 00:04:44.396 A:middle
offering my password from the

00:04:44.396 --> 00:04:45.366 A:middle
website for Shiny.

00:04:45.836 --> 00:04:47.796 A:middle
And with one tap, that

00:04:47.796 --> 00:04:48.666 A:middle
information is filled.

00:04:49.286 --> 00:04:51.666 A:middle
And with another tap, I'm logged

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:51.866 A:middle
in.

00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:55.106 A:middle
That's an adorable puppy, 13 out

00:04:55.816 --> 00:04:57.176 A:middle
of 10.

00:04:57.366 --> 00:04:58.576 A:middle
So let's do that one more time.

00:04:58.576 --> 00:04:59.496 A:middle
It went by pretty quickly.

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.336 A:middle
This time I'll just happen to

00:05:01.336 --> 00:05:02.916 A:middle
touch into the password field.

00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:04.636 A:middle
And I'm offered the same thing.

00:05:05.176 --> 00:05:06.596 A:middle
I can tap and tap.

00:05:07.436 --> 00:05:08.196 A:middle
And I'm logged in.

00:05:08.986 --> 00:05:09.736 A:middle
Another good dog.

00:05:09.736 --> 00:05:13.926 A:middle
So one thing I want to point out

00:05:13.926 --> 00:05:16.136 A:middle
while I'm showing you this is I

00:05:16.136 --> 00:05:18.406 A:middle
mentioned a moment ago that iOS

00:05:18.406 --> 00:05:20.096 A:middle
takes password security very

00:05:20.096 --> 00:05:20.656 A:middle
seriously.

00:05:22.016 --> 00:05:23.216 A:middle
And so the big thing to notice

00:05:23.216 --> 00:05:26.156 A:middle
here is iOS isn't guessing that

00:05:26.156 --> 00:05:28.676 A:middle
shiny.example.com is the website

00:05:28.676 --> 00:05:29.306 A:middle
for the Shiny app.

00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:32.326 A:middle
There is a strong two-way secure

00:05:32.326 --> 00:05:34.156 A:middle
association between that app and

00:05:34.156 --> 00:05:36.266 A:middle
that website that allows iOS to

00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:37.756 A:middle
put the exact right credential

00:05:37.756 --> 00:05:38.736 A:middle
that the user's looking for

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:40.086 A:middle
right on the QuickType bar.

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:41.416 A:middle
All right.

00:05:41.786 --> 00:05:44.000 A:middle
Let's go back to some slides.

00:05:50.126 --> 00:05:52.786 A:middle
You just saw that iOS 11 put the

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:54.446 A:middle
password that I needed to log

00:05:54.446 --> 00:05:56.336 A:middle
into Shiny directly on the

00:05:56.336 --> 00:05:57.326 A:middle
QuickType bar above the

00:05:57.326 --> 00:05:59.396 A:middle
keyboard, which made logging in

00:05:59.396 --> 00:06:00.816 A:middle
as simple as two taps.

00:05:59.396 --> 00:06:00.816 A:middle
as simple as two taps.

00:06:01.596 --> 00:06:03.896 A:middle
Now, I have no reason to abandon

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.386 A:middle
the app and go back to Safari

00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:06.546 A:middle
where I was already logged in.

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:08.496 A:middle
It's just as easy to log into

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:11.086 A:middle
the app.

00:06:11.346 --> 00:06:12.146 A:middle
Quick show of hands.

00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:14.396 A:middle
How many of you have a screen in

00:06:14.396 --> 00:06:15.546 A:middle
your app that looks like this

00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:16.626 A:middle
one with a username and a

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:17.276 A:middle
password field?

00:06:18.636 --> 00:06:19.056 A:middle
All right.

00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:20.146 A:middle
That's a lot of you.

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:21.016 A:middle
And you're all in the right

00:06:21.016 --> 00:06:21.396 A:middle
place.

00:06:22.226 --> 00:06:23.966 A:middle
So, one more show of hands.

00:06:25.396 --> 00:06:27.426 A:middle
How many of those apps are you

00:06:27.426 --> 00:06:28.786 A:middle
logging into your own backend

00:06:28.786 --> 00:06:30.416 A:middle
that you manage yourself instead

00:06:30.416 --> 00:06:31.526 A:middle
of a third party service?

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:33.296 A:middle
All right.

00:06:33.296 --> 00:06:33.906 A:middle
That's a lot of you.

00:06:34.926 --> 00:06:36.146 A:middle
For everyone who kept their hand

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.446 A:middle
up, who raised it a second time,

00:06:37.776 --> 00:06:38.956 A:middle
I'm going to be talking to you

00:06:38.956 --> 00:06:39.696 A:middle
throughout most of this

00:06:39.696 --> 00:06:40.326 A:middle
presentation.

00:06:41.346 --> 00:06:42.256 A:middle
But if you're logging into a

00:06:42.256 --> 00:06:43.656 A:middle
third party service like a

00:06:43.656 --> 00:06:44.576 A:middle
social network, I'll have a

00:06:44.756 --> 00:06:45.826 A:middle
little something for you toward

00:06:45.826 --> 00:06:45.976 A:middle
the end.

00:06:51.306 --> 00:06:53.216 A:middle
We want Password AutoFill to

00:06:53.216 --> 00:06:54.816 A:middle
work for as many of your apps as

00:06:54.816 --> 00:06:55.306 A:middle
possible.

00:06:56.076 --> 00:06:58.096 A:middle
So we built heuristics into iOS

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:00.456 A:middle
that make some parts of Password

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:00.456 A:middle
that make some parts of Password

00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:02.626 A:middle
AutoFill work automatically in

00:07:02.626 --> 00:07:04.236 A:middle
many apps without you

00:07:04.236 --> 00:07:05.626 A:middle
necessarily having to change

00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:05.986 A:middle
anything.

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:09.486 A:middle
However, for your users to get

00:07:09.486 --> 00:07:11.266 A:middle
the best experience where the

00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:13.216 A:middle
exact right credential shows up

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:15.666 A:middle
on the QuickType bar, we're

00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:16.456 A:middle
going to need a little bit of

00:07:16.456 --> 00:07:16.786 A:middle
your help.

00:07:16.816 --> 00:07:18.916 A:middle
So what we're going to focus on

00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:20.606 A:middle
for the rest of this session is

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:22.586 A:middle
guaranteeing that your apps get

00:07:22.586 --> 00:07:24.256 A:middle
the experience that you just saw

00:07:24.256 --> 00:07:25.636 A:middle
in the Shiny app.

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:27.426 A:middle
And we'll do that by walking

00:07:27.426 --> 00:07:28.276 A:middle
through these topics.

00:07:30.696 --> 00:07:32.706 A:middle
The first topic is about making

00:07:32.706 --> 00:07:34.666 A:middle
the QuickType bar appear in your

00:07:34.666 --> 00:07:36.366 A:middle
username and password fields in

00:07:36.366 --> 00:07:37.576 A:middle
your app.

00:07:38.026 --> 00:07:40.026 A:middle
The second is about making sure

00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:41.276 A:middle
that the passwords are filled

00:07:41.326 --> 00:07:42.186 A:middle
properly into the app.

00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:44.126 A:middle
And that your app works properly

00:07:44.126 --> 00:07:45.366 A:middle
after a user taps on one of the

00:07:45.366 --> 00:07:45.936 A:middle
suggestions.

00:07:47.196 --> 00:07:48.846 A:middle
Then, we'll talk about making

00:07:48.846 --> 00:07:50.296 A:middle
sure that the exact right

00:07:50.296 --> 00:07:51.536 A:middle
credential that your user is

00:07:51.536 --> 00:07:53.056 A:middle
looking for, the credential from

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.796 A:middle
your website, shows up on the

00:07:54.796 --> 00:07:55.996 A:middle
left-hand side of the QuickType

00:07:56.026 --> 00:07:56.226 A:middle
bar.

00:07:56.346 --> 00:07:58.906 A:middle
And then at the end, we'll

00:07:58.906 --> 00:08:00.086 A:middle
circle back around and talk

00:07:58.906 --> 00:08:00.086 A:middle
circle back around and talk

00:08:00.086 --> 00:08:01.596 A:middle
about authenticating against a

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:03.746 A:middle
third party service, a service

00:08:03.746 --> 00:08:05.546 A:middle
that's not the same as your app.

00:08:06.616 --> 00:08:08.646 A:middle
So let's get started by talking

00:08:08.646 --> 00:08:10.046 A:middle
about making the QuickType bar

00:08:10.046 --> 00:08:10.256 A:middle
appear.

00:08:12.596 --> 00:08:13.896 A:middle
The first thing to know about

00:08:13.896 --> 00:08:15.196 A:middle
the QuickType bar appearing is

00:08:15.716 --> 00:08:17.326 A:middle
that it will only appear if you

00:08:17.326 --> 00:08:19.906 A:middle
have at least one saved password

00:08:19.906 --> 00:08:21.076 A:middle
on an iOS device.

00:08:21.736 --> 00:08:22.816 A:middle
There's no need for us to offer

00:08:22.816 --> 00:08:23.996 A:middle
Password AutoFill if there are

00:08:23.996 --> 00:08:24.836 A:middle
no passwords to fill.

00:08:28.126 --> 00:08:29.926 A:middle
The next thing to know is that

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.986 A:middle
UITextView and UITextField are

00:08:32.986 --> 00:08:34.486 A:middle
automatically eligible for

00:08:34.486 --> 00:08:36.275 A:middle
consideration or Password

00:08:36.275 --> 00:08:36.716 A:middle
AutoFill.

00:08:38.015 --> 00:08:39.716 A:middle
So, if you're using these

00:08:39.716 --> 00:08:41.586 A:middle
standard controls out of UIKit,

00:08:42.056 --> 00:08:43.166 A:middle
you're already in a really good

00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:43.576 A:middle
place.

00:08:44.976 --> 00:08:47.096 A:middle
However, if you're rolling your

00:08:47.096 --> 00:08:48.816 A:middle
own text fields, no need to

00:08:48.816 --> 00:08:49.096 A:middle
worry.

00:08:49.606 --> 00:08:51.126 A:middle
If your text field conforms to

00:08:51.126 --> 00:08:53.666 A:middle
UITextInput, it's also eligible

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:54.636 A:middle
for Password Autofill.

00:08:55.206 --> 00:08:57.686 A:middle
And I mentioned this earlier,

00:08:57.786 --> 00:08:59.126 A:middle
but iOS is going to use

00:08:59.126 --> 00:09:01.476 A:middle
heuristics to determine where to

00:08:59.126 --> 00:09:01.476 A:middle
heuristics to determine where to

00:09:01.476 --> 00:09:03.386 A:middle
show the QuickType bar in your

00:09:03.386 --> 00:09:04.506 A:middle
username and your password

00:09:04.506 --> 00:09:04.946 A:middle
fields.

00:09:06.336 --> 00:09:09.176 A:middle
And iOS's heuristics are pretty

00:09:09.176 --> 00:09:09.516 A:middle
good.

00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:11.816 A:middle
But what we're here to do is to

00:09:11.816 --> 00:09:14.636 A:middle
guarantee that your app has

00:09:14.636 --> 00:09:15.596 A:middle
Password AutoFill.

00:09:16.146 --> 00:09:17.616 A:middle
And we can guarantee that by

00:09:17.616 --> 00:09:20.076 A:middle
having you tell iOS which of

00:09:20.076 --> 00:09:21.056 A:middle
your fields is the username

00:09:21.056 --> 00:09:22.516 A:middle
field and which is the password

00:09:22.516 --> 00:09:22.796 A:middle
field.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.136 A:middle
And the way that we'll do this

00:09:26.076 --> 00:09:28.126 A:middle
is through UITextContentType.

00:09:28.496 --> 00:09:30.466 A:middle
By setting a content type on the

00:09:30.466 --> 00:09:30.976 A:middle
text fields.

00:09:33.496 --> 00:09:36.006 A:middle
UITextContentType was introduced

00:09:36.006 --> 00:09:37.896 A:middle
as an optional property on the

00:09:37.896 --> 00:09:40.216 A:middle
UITextInputTraits protocol in

00:09:40.356 --> 00:09:42.526 A:middle
iOS 10.

00:09:42.526 --> 00:09:43.906 A:middle
iOS uses it to have a better

00:09:43.906 --> 00:09:45.436 A:middle
understanding of what

00:09:45.436 --> 00:09:46.696 A:middle
information is in your text

00:09:46.696 --> 00:09:47.116 A:middle
fields.

00:09:48.246 --> 00:09:50.056 A:middle
So you could imagine that iOS

00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:51.076 A:middle
would offer a different and

00:09:51.076 --> 00:09:52.666 A:middle
better keyboard or auto

00:09:52.666 --> 00:09:54.406 A:middle
corrections if it knew that your

00:09:54.406 --> 00:09:55.576 A:middle
users was typing an email

00:09:55.576 --> 00:09:58.416 A:middle
address versus, say, their last

00:09:58.416 --> 00:09:58.696 A:middle
name.

00:09:58.696 --> 00:10:01.566 A:middle
Here are the text content types

00:09:58.696 --> 00:10:01.566 A:middle
Here are the text content types

00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:03.896 A:middle
that are present in iOS 10, just

00:10:03.896 --> 00:10:04.806 A:middle
to give you a refresher.

00:10:08.036 --> 00:10:09.616 A:middle
And as you've probably guessed,

00:10:09.616 --> 00:10:12.046 A:middle
in iOS 11 there are two new text

00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:13.956 A:middle
content types, username and

00:10:13.956 --> 00:10:15.416 A:middle
password, that you can tag your

00:10:15.416 --> 00:10:16.546 A:middle
fields with.

00:10:18.336 --> 00:10:20.526 A:middle
So to guarantee that Password

00:10:20.526 --> 00:10:22.036 A:middle
AutoFill is working in your

00:10:22.036 --> 00:10:23.706 A:middle
apps, we're going to deploy

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:25.166 A:middle
UITextContentType.

00:10:25.896 --> 00:10:27.386 A:middle
That's going to be our guarantee

00:10:27.386 --> 00:10:28.396 A:middle
that Password AutoFill is

00:10:28.396 --> 00:10:30.276 A:middle
available in your app.

00:10:30.436 --> 00:10:31.996 A:middle
You can set text content types

00:10:32.206 --> 00:10:32.936 A:middle
from within code.

00:10:33.656 --> 00:10:35.166 A:middle
Or, with an interface filter.

00:10:35.526 --> 00:10:36.356 A:middle
And we'll show you how to do

00:10:36.356 --> 00:10:37.666 A:middle
that in a little bit.

00:10:40.616 --> 00:10:42.596 A:middle
The username text content type

00:10:43.146 --> 00:10:44.896 A:middle
is particularly useful if your

00:10:45.076 --> 00:10:46.666 A:middle
app has a two-screen login

00:10:46.666 --> 00:10:48.646 A:middle
experience where your username

00:10:48.646 --> 00:10:50.566 A:middle
field is on a different view or

00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:52.266 A:middle
screen than your password.

00:10:53.116 --> 00:10:55.926 A:middle
In this case, if you tag your

00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:57.466 A:middle
username field with the username

00:10:57.466 --> 00:10:59.276 A:middle
text content type, we'll be able

00:10:59.276 --> 00:11:00.866 A:middle
to offer the QuickType bar on

00:10:59.276 --> 00:11:00.866 A:middle
to offer the QuickType bar on

00:11:00.866 --> 00:11:01.926 A:middle
both of the screens.

00:11:04.416 --> 00:11:06.116 A:middle
If you're already using the

00:11:06.116 --> 00:11:07.856 A:middle
email address text content type,

00:11:08.446 --> 00:11:09.326 A:middle
there's no need to worry.

00:11:10.016 --> 00:11:11.866 A:middle
You can combine the username

00:11:11.866 --> 00:11:13.806 A:middle
text content type and the email

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:15.636 A:middle
keyboard to give your users the

00:11:15.636 --> 00:11:17.976 A:middle
best of both worlds, where they

00:11:17.976 --> 00:11:19.386 A:middle
get an email address keyboard

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.416 A:middle
and QuickType Autofill.

00:11:24.676 --> 00:11:26.646 A:middle
The password text content type

00:11:27.026 --> 00:11:29.586 A:middle
is particularly useful if you

00:11:29.586 --> 00:11:30.826 A:middle
have a feature in your app that

00:11:30.826 --> 00:11:32.426 A:middle
reveals the password that the

00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:34.026 A:middle
user is typing in plain text to

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:34.556 A:middle
help them out.

00:11:35.876 --> 00:11:38.066 A:middle
When your field is in plain text

00:11:38.066 --> 00:11:40.216 A:middle
iOS won't be able to tell that

00:11:40.216 --> 00:11:41.866 A:middle
it's a password field unless you

00:11:41.866 --> 00:11:43.266 A:middle
tag the field as a password.

00:11:43.996 --> 00:11:45.466 A:middle
So if you do that, the QuickType

00:11:45.466 --> 00:11:46.526 A:middle
bar will still work in that

00:11:46.526 --> 00:11:47.926 A:middle
field, even when it's not a

00:11:47.926 --> 00:11:48.686 A:middle
secure entry.

00:11:49.276 --> 00:11:53.456 A:middle
And at this point, once you've

00:11:53.456 --> 00:11:56.166 A:middle
done this, you might see a

00:11:56.166 --> 00:11:57.926 A:middle
Password AutoFill QuickType bar

00:11:57.976 --> 00:12:00.376 A:middle
in your app with its key icon on

00:11:57.976 --> 00:12:00.376 A:middle
in your app with its key icon on

00:12:00.376 --> 00:12:02.116 A:middle
the right, but without any

00:12:02.116 --> 00:12:03.656 A:middle
specific credentials showing up

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:04.156 A:middle
on the left.

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.196 A:middle
This is actually expected.

00:12:06.196 --> 00:12:07.276 A:middle
And it's a really good first

00:12:07.276 --> 00:12:07.576 A:middle
step.

00:12:08.316 --> 00:12:09.786 A:middle
In a little bit we'll talk about

00:12:09.786 --> 00:12:11.586 A:middle
making your website's passwords

00:12:11.586 --> 00:12:12.946 A:middle
show up on the left.

00:12:13.656 --> 00:12:15.456 A:middle
But what seeing this bar means

00:12:15.796 --> 00:12:17.506 A:middle
is that iOS is ready to offer

00:12:17.506 --> 00:12:18.516 A:middle
Password AutoFill.

00:12:18.516 --> 00:12:21.206 A:middle
And if users tap on that key on

00:12:21.206 --> 00:12:23.176 A:middle
the right-hand side, they'll be

00:12:23.176 --> 00:12:24.856 A:middle
able to authenticate using Touch

00:12:24.856 --> 00:12:27.526 A:middle
ID and see a list of their

00:12:27.526 --> 00:12:29.306 A:middle
passwords that they can search

00:12:29.306 --> 00:12:30.826 A:middle
through or scroll through in

00:12:30.826 --> 00:12:31.776 A:middle
order to fill one of those

00:12:31.776 --> 00:12:34.216 A:middle
passwords within your app.

00:12:34.216 --> 00:12:35.336 A:middle
And once they've found the right

00:12:35.336 --> 00:12:38.276 A:middle
password, and they tap it, iOS

00:12:38.276 --> 00:12:39.906 A:middle
will fill that information into

00:12:39.956 --> 00:12:41.816 A:middle
your fields.

00:12:41.976 --> 00:12:43.246 A:middle
Which brings us to our next

00:12:43.246 --> 00:12:45.946 A:middle
topic, which is ensuring the

00:12:45.946 --> 00:12:48.066 A:middle
information that's filled into

00:12:48.066 --> 00:12:49.606 A:middle
your text fields is understood

00:12:49.606 --> 00:12:51.556 A:middle
by your app and that users able

00:12:51.556 --> 00:12:52.936 A:middle
to log in successfully

00:12:52.936 --> 00:12:53.476 A:middle
afterward.

00:12:54.226 --> 00:12:56.926 A:middle
iOS is going to do its best to

00:12:56.926 --> 00:12:58.136 A:middle
put information into your

00:12:58.136 --> 00:13:00.076 A:middle
username and password fields in

00:12:58.136 --> 00:13:00.076 A:middle
username and password fields in

00:13:00.076 --> 00:13:01.596 A:middle
a very similar way to how users

00:13:01.596 --> 00:13:02.716 A:middle
would type that information

00:13:02.716 --> 00:13:03.316 A:middle
themselves.

00:13:04.236 --> 00:13:05.346 A:middle
But it's still a good idea to

00:13:05.346 --> 00:13:07.676 A:middle
test that your app behaves

00:13:07.716 --> 00:13:09.446 A:middle
properly after information has

00:13:09.446 --> 00:13:10.186 A:middle
been autofilled.

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:11.966 A:middle
What we want to see is that

00:13:11.966 --> 00:13:13.316 A:middle
users are able to just tap your

00:13:13.316 --> 00:13:15.406 A:middle
sign-in button and log directly

00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:16.066 A:middle
in.

00:13:16.856 --> 00:13:17.946 A:middle
So let's talk about what you

00:13:17.946 --> 00:13:20.366 A:middle
need to know about how Password

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:22.206 A:middle
AutoFill fills into your app.

00:13:23.496 --> 00:13:24.926 A:middle
The first thing is something

00:13:24.926 --> 00:13:26.786 A:middle
you've already seen, which is

00:13:26.786 --> 00:13:28.196 A:middle
that iOS will fill both the

00:13:28.196 --> 00:13:30.036 A:middle
username and the password fields

00:13:30.376 --> 00:13:31.306 A:middle
in a single gesture.

00:13:31.496 --> 00:13:34.146 A:middle
iOS will change your app's first

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:35.816 A:middle
responder in order to do this.

00:13:36.296 --> 00:13:39.416 A:middle
iOS is going to do this even if

00:13:39.416 --> 00:13:40.826 A:middle
your app prevents changing the

00:13:40.826 --> 00:13:42.186 A:middle
first responder at that time.

00:13:42.976 --> 00:13:43.886 A:middle
So if you're doing something

00:13:43.886 --> 00:13:47.776 A:middle
like this, it's worth knowing.

00:13:48.046 --> 00:13:50.016 A:middle
A moment ago I showed you the

00:13:50.016 --> 00:13:51.316 A:middle
flow where a user taps on the

00:13:51.316 --> 00:13:53.086 A:middle
key icon and Touch ID comes up.

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:55.806 A:middle
And when Touch ID appears, your

00:13:55.806 --> 00:13:57.046 A:middle
app will become inactive.

00:13:57.046 --> 00:14:00.106 A:middle
And that's worth knowing because

00:13:57.046 --> 00:14:00.106 A:middle
And that's worth knowing because

00:14:00.106 --> 00:14:02.356 A:middle
it leads directly into our first

00:14:03.056 --> 00:14:04.656 A:middle
best practice.

00:14:04.716 --> 00:14:06.526 A:middle
Which is that when Touch ID

00:14:06.526 --> 00:14:08.496 A:middle
appears, there's no need for you

00:14:08.496 --> 00:14:11.266 A:middle
to tear down your login UI or

00:14:11.266 --> 00:14:13.036 A:middle
hide it when your app becomes

00:14:13.036 --> 00:14:13.436 A:middle
inactive.

00:14:13.966 --> 00:14:15.486 A:middle
Because if you do this, all a

00:14:15.486 --> 00:14:17.036 A:middle
user is going to see is tapping

00:14:17.036 --> 00:14:18.796 A:middle
on the key, finding the right

00:14:18.796 --> 00:14:19.676 A:middle
password and tapping it.

00:14:19.676 --> 00:14:21.216 A:middle
And then iOS isn't going to be

00:14:21.216 --> 00:14:22.536 A:middle
able to fill anything because

00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:23.576 A:middle
the text fields will have

00:14:23.576 --> 00:14:24.246 A:middle
disappeared.

00:14:25.236 --> 00:14:27.216 A:middle
So, it might be a good idea to

00:14:27.336 --> 00:14:29.036 A:middle
hide sensitive information in

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:30.436 A:middle
your app when your app becomes

00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:30.876 A:middle
inactive.

00:14:31.786 --> 00:14:33.066 A:middle
But if a user actually hasn't

00:14:33.066 --> 00:14:34.596 A:middle
finished logging in yet, that's

00:14:34.596 --> 00:14:35.746 A:middle
probably not necessary.

00:14:38.016 --> 00:14:40.166 A:middle
You might have buttons in your

00:14:40.566 --> 00:14:41.626 A:middle
app, like a login button or a

00:14:41.626 --> 00:14:43.466 A:middle
sign-in button, that only lights

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.116 A:middle
up and enables itself once

00:14:45.116 --> 00:14:46.466 A:middle
there's actually information

00:14:46.586 --> 00:14:48.396 A:middle
filled into the username and

00:14:48.396 --> 00:14:49.136 A:middle
password field.

00:14:49.726 --> 00:14:51.926 A:middle
And the best practice here is to

00:14:51.926 --> 00:14:54.016 A:middle
us did change notifications or

00:14:54.376 --> 00:14:56.156 A:middle
delegate methods to revalidate

00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:57.766 A:middle
those buttons whenever the text

00:14:57.766 --> 00:14:58.246 A:middle
changes.

00:14:58.816 --> 00:15:03.446 A:middle
If you're using UITextField,

00:14:58.816 --> 00:15:03.446 A:middle
If you're using UITextField,

00:15:03.906 --> 00:15:05.046 A:middle
there's a notification that you

00:15:05.046 --> 00:15:05.566 A:middle
can use.

00:15:06.276 --> 00:15:07.846 A:middle
If you're using UITextView,

00:15:07.846 --> 00:15:10.026 A:middle
there's a notification and a

00:15:10.026 --> 00:15:10.716 A:middle
delegate method.

00:15:11.636 --> 00:15:12.626 A:middle
And if you're rolling your own

00:15:12.626 --> 00:15:15.056 A:middle
custom text input, if you can

00:15:15.056 --> 00:15:16.796 A:middle
form the UITextInputDelegate,

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:18.306 A:middle
there's a delegate method that

00:15:18.306 --> 00:15:19.966 A:middle
you can listen to again to

00:15:19.966 --> 00:15:21.066 A:middle
revalidate your buttons.

00:15:21.646 --> 00:15:25.206 A:middle
And when you're doing that

00:15:25.206 --> 00:15:27.136 A:middle
validation, you should read

00:15:27.136 --> 00:15:29.296 A:middle
information directly from your

00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:30.876 A:middle
text field's text property.

00:15:31.776 --> 00:15:34.106 A:middle
UIKit makes it incredibly cheap

00:15:34.356 --> 00:15:35.686 A:middle
to read information out of a

00:15:35.686 --> 00:15:36.256 A:middle
text field.

00:15:36.606 --> 00:15:37.676 A:middle
And it's always accurate.

00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:40.626 A:middle
If you do this, you'll eliminate

00:15:40.836 --> 00:15:42.566 A:middle
categorically an entire class of

00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:43.646 A:middle
bugs that you can have with

00:15:43.646 --> 00:15:45.666 A:middle
cash-in validation based on what

00:15:45.666 --> 00:15:47.146 A:middle
information is entered into your

00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:47.766 A:middle
text fields.

00:15:52.376 --> 00:15:53.186 A:middle
And that's it.

00:15:53.626 --> 00:15:55.316 A:middle
That's just a few best practices

00:15:55.316 --> 00:15:57.246 A:middle
for ensuring that after a user

00:15:57.246 --> 00:15:59.896 A:middle
has used AutoFill, that your app

00:15:59.896 --> 00:16:01.556 A:middle
is able to login successfully.

00:15:59.896 --> 00:16:01.556 A:middle
is able to login successfully.

00:16:01.746 --> 00:16:02.826 A:middle
And users can go about their

00:16:02.826 --> 00:16:03.236 A:middle
business.

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.146 A:middle
Which brings us to our third

00:16:06.146 --> 00:16:08.826 A:middle
topic, which is making sure that

00:16:08.826 --> 00:16:10.486 A:middle
the QuickType bar is showing the

00:16:10.486 --> 00:16:11.956 A:middle
exact right credentials for your

00:16:11.956 --> 00:16:12.366 A:middle
website.

00:16:12.366 --> 00:16:17.676 A:middle
So at this point in your testing

00:16:18.146 --> 00:16:19.406 A:middle
you might still have what we saw

00:16:19.406 --> 00:16:21.626 A:middle
earlier, which is a bar with a

00:16:21.626 --> 00:16:23.086 A:middle
key on it, but without any

00:16:23.086 --> 00:16:24.266 A:middle
specific credentials on the

00:16:24.266 --> 00:16:24.546 A:middle
left.

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:27.066 A:middle
But as you know, in order to

00:16:27.066 --> 00:16:28.916 A:middle
give users the best experience,

00:16:29.416 --> 00:16:30.836 A:middle
the one that is most going to

00:16:30.836 --> 00:16:32.216 A:middle
reduce the odds that they

00:16:32.216 --> 00:16:34.956 A:middle
abandon your app, we'll want the

00:16:34.956 --> 00:16:36.366 A:middle
exact correct credentials

00:16:36.366 --> 00:16:37.626 A:middle
showing up on the QuickType bar.

00:16:38.186 --> 00:16:40.616 A:middle
And I touched on this briefly

00:16:40.616 --> 00:16:42.556 A:middle
during the demo earlier, but

00:16:42.556 --> 00:16:44.256 A:middle
Password AutoFill will only put

00:16:44.256 --> 00:16:45.876 A:middle
credentials on the QuickType bar

00:16:46.166 --> 00:16:47.486 A:middle
when it is safe to do so.

00:16:47.786 --> 00:16:48.516 A:middle
When it's secure.

00:16:48.776 --> 00:16:52.596 A:middle
iOS is not guessing what

00:16:53.106 --> 00:16:54.926 A:middle
websites are affiliated with

00:16:54.926 --> 00:16:56.466 A:middle
your app to find out which

00:16:56.466 --> 00:16:57.626 A:middle
passwords are correct for your

00:16:58.246 --> 00:16:58.426 A:middle
app.

00:16:58.426 --> 00:16:59.166 A:middle
iOS knows.

00:16:59.166 --> 00:17:02.206 A:middle
So if you've adopted universal

00:16:59.166 --> 00:17:02.206 A:middle
So if you've adopted universal

00:17:02.206 --> 00:17:04.806 A:middle
links, that feature that can

00:17:04.806 --> 00:17:06.465 A:middle
open up links when a user taps

00:17:06.465 --> 00:17:07.695 A:middle
on them inside of your app,

00:17:08.366 --> 00:17:09.705 A:middle
rather than opening them up in

00:17:09.705 --> 00:17:11.965 A:middle
Safari, if you've done that, you

00:17:11.965 --> 00:17:13.776 A:middle
might actually already see that

00:17:13.776 --> 00:17:15.266 A:middle
iOS understands that your app

00:17:15.266 --> 00:17:16.816 A:middle
and your website are associated.

00:17:16.816 --> 00:17:17.976 A:middle
And it'll put the right

00:17:17.976 --> 00:17:19.256 A:middle
credentials on the QuickType

00:17:19.256 --> 00:17:19.506 A:middle
bar.

00:17:20.056 --> 00:17:22.415 A:middle
But if you haven't adopted

00:17:22.415 --> 00:17:23.976 A:middle
universal links, or it doesn't

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.106 A:middle
really make sense for you to do

00:17:25.106 --> 00:17:26.846 A:middle
so, there's no need to worry.

00:17:27.425 --> 00:17:29.126 A:middle
We have a dedicated technology

00:17:29.386 --> 00:17:30.506 A:middle
to linking your app and your

00:17:30.506 --> 00:17:31.766 A:middle
website together strongly.

00:17:31.766 --> 00:17:32.586 A:middle
And I'm going to walk you

00:17:32.586 --> 00:17:32.976 A:middle
through it.

00:17:38.056 --> 00:17:39.686 A:middle
In this diagram it's your app on

00:17:39.686 --> 00:17:40.026 A:middle
the left.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:41.366 A:middle
And on the right is your web

00:17:41.366 --> 00:17:42.426 A:middle
server or your backend.

00:17:43.266 --> 00:17:44.866 A:middle
So the ideas is that your app,

00:17:45.816 --> 00:17:47.786 A:middle
through its signed entitlements,

00:17:48.156 --> 00:17:51.096 A:middle
says what website or websites it

00:17:51.096 --> 00:17:51.986 A:middle
is affiliated with.

00:17:52.926 --> 00:17:54.016 A:middle
And whenever your app is

00:17:54.016 --> 00:17:55.956 A:middle
installed or iOS installs an

00:17:55.986 --> 00:17:58.216 A:middle
update, iOS is going to check

00:17:58.356 --> 00:18:00.636 A:middle
with that domain at a particular

00:17:58.356 --> 00:18:00.636 A:middle
with that domain at a particular

00:18:00.636 --> 00:18:03.576 A:middle
file path to see, to look for

00:18:03.576 --> 00:18:04.276 A:middle
some information.

00:18:05.576 --> 00:18:07.696 A:middle
If you don't know the well-known

00:18:07.696 --> 00:18:09.396 A:middle
directory, it's just a standard

00:18:09.396 --> 00:18:10.546 A:middle
place to put files for

00:18:10.546 --> 00:18:12.416 A:middle
information discovery, like the

00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:13.376 A:middle
file I'm about to tell you

00:18:13.376 --> 00:18:13.676 A:middle
about:

00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:15.146 A:middle
Apple-app-site-association.

00:18:16.376 --> 00:18:18.896 A:middle
iOS will only ever attempt to

00:18:18.896 --> 00:18:22.026 A:middle
fetch this file over HTTPS, over

00:18:22.026 --> 00:18:22.766 A:middle
a secure connection.

00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:28.226 A:middle
In response to that request,

00:18:28.716 --> 00:18:30.996 A:middle
your website can return a JSON

00:18:30.996 --> 00:18:31.616 A:middle
response.

00:18:32.346 --> 00:18:33.846 A:middle
And if that JSON response is

00:18:33.886 --> 00:18:35.606 A:middle
formatted properly, what it can

00:18:35.606 --> 00:18:37.766 A:middle
say is: Here is the list of apps

00:18:37.936 --> 00:18:39.116 A:middle
that I'm associated with.

00:18:39.646 --> 00:18:44.116 A:middle
And if the app points to the

00:18:44.116 --> 00:18:45.896 A:middle
website, and the website points

00:18:45.896 --> 00:18:47.656 A:middle
right back to the app, boom!

00:18:48.136 --> 00:18:49.756 A:middle
We have a secure two-way link.

00:18:50.396 --> 00:18:52.546 A:middle
So to put what I've told you

00:18:52.546 --> 00:18:54.286 A:middle
about so far into practice,

00:18:54.796 --> 00:18:56.416 A:middle
particularly with establishing

00:18:56.416 --> 00:18:58.296 A:middle
this secure connection between

00:18:58.296 --> 00:19:00.366 A:middle
your app and your website, I am

00:18:58.296 --> 00:19:00.366 A:middle
your app and your website, I am

00:19:00.366 --> 00:19:02.216 A:middle
delighted to invite my colleague

00:19:02.216 --> 00:19:04.036 A:middle
Maureen Daum to the stage to

00:19:04.036 --> 00:19:04.676 A:middle
give you a demo.

00:19:05.346 --> 00:19:05.626 A:middle
Maureen.

00:19:07.516 --> 00:19:12.876 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:13.376 --> 00:19:14.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Ricky.

00:19:16.396 --> 00:19:18.786 A:middle
So, here I have the Shiny app

00:19:19.006 --> 00:19:20.896 A:middle
before we've done any work to

00:19:20.896 --> 00:19:23.186 A:middle
make Password AutoFill work with

00:19:23.806 --> 00:19:23.873 A:middle
it.

00:19:24.076 --> 00:19:25.546 A:middle
So when I tap in the username

00:19:25.586 --> 00:19:28.566 A:middle
field, iOS automatically

00:19:28.566 --> 00:19:30.606 A:middle
detected that this is in fact

00:19:30.606 --> 00:19:31.486 A:middle
the username field.

00:19:31.486 --> 00:19:33.316 A:middle
And it gives us the Password

00:19:33.316 --> 00:19:35.516 A:middle
AutoFill QuickType bar -- thank

00:19:35.516 --> 00:19:36.846 A:middle
you -- for free.

00:19:37.356 --> 00:19:38.996 A:middle
So now users, if they don't

00:19:38.996 --> 00:19:41.056 A:middle
remember their credentials, can

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:42.336 A:middle
tap on the Key icon,

00:19:42.866 --> 00:19:45.636 A:middle
authenticate with Touch ID and

00:19:45.636 --> 00:19:47.326 A:middle
find the right credential.

00:19:47.326 --> 00:19:48.556 A:middle
So here it is.

00:19:48.556 --> 00:19:51.416 A:middle
So this is a great experience

00:19:51.416 --> 00:19:52.976 A:middle
for my users that might not

00:19:52.976 --> 00:19:54.886 A:middle
remember their credentials.

00:19:55.446 --> 00:19:56.986 A:middle
But what I really want to make

00:19:56.986 --> 00:19:59.086 A:middle
it even easier for them to log

00:19:59.086 --> 00:20:01.136 A:middle
in is to have those credentials

00:19:59.086 --> 00:20:01.136 A:middle
in is to have those credentials

00:20:01.136 --> 00:20:03.906 A:middle
show up right on the QuickType

00:20:03.906 --> 00:20:04.176 A:middle
bar.

00:20:04.316 --> 00:20:06.796 A:middle
So I'm going to do two things in

00:20:06.796 --> 00:20:07.426 A:middle
this demo.

00:20:08.016 --> 00:20:10.096 A:middle
The first is to guarantee that

00:20:10.096 --> 00:20:11.806 A:middle
we get this password QuickType

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.876 A:middle
bar instead of just relying on

00:20:13.876 --> 00:20:14.316 A:middle
the heuristics.

00:20:14.316 --> 00:20:16.456 A:middle
And the second thing is to get

00:20:16.456 --> 00:20:17.826 A:middle
the right credentials on the

00:20:17.826 --> 00:20:18.556 A:middle
QuickType bar.

00:20:19.086 --> 00:20:20.406 A:middle
So let's do that first step,

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:22.416 A:middle
guaranteeing that we get the

00:20:22.416 --> 00:20:23.046 A:middle
credentials.

00:20:23.656 --> 00:20:25.576 A:middle
To do this, I'm going to tag my

00:20:25.576 --> 00:20:27.166 A:middle
username and password fields

00:20:27.556 --> 00:20:28.746 A:middle
with the right content type.

00:20:28.846 --> 00:20:30.976 A:middle
So here's my username field.

00:20:31.056 --> 00:20:33.126 A:middle
And I've already set its content

00:20:33.126 --> 00:20:35.336 A:middle
type to email address, because

00:20:35.336 --> 00:20:37.106 A:middle
some of my usernames might be

00:20:37.106 --> 00:20:37.886 A:middle
email addresses.

00:20:38.496 --> 00:20:39.716 A:middle
But if I switch this to

00:20:39.716 --> 00:20:41.086 A:middle
username, down here at the

00:20:41.086 --> 00:20:43.216 A:middle
bottom, I can set the keyboard

00:20:43.216 --> 00:20:44.646 A:middle
type to email address.

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:46.736 A:middle
So go down here the keyboard

00:20:46.736 --> 00:20:49.106 A:middle
type and set that one to email.

00:20:49.626 --> 00:20:51.566 A:middle
So now if the user has to type

00:20:51.566 --> 00:20:53.276 A:middle
in their username, they'll still

00:20:53.276 --> 00:20:54.406 A:middle
get the right keyboard.

00:20:55.356 --> 00:20:57.006 A:middle
And now I'll go to password and

00:20:57.056 --> 00:20:58.576 A:middle
set that content type to

00:20:58.576 --> 00:21:00.326 A:middle
password, all the way at the

00:20:58.576 --> 00:21:00.326 A:middle
password, all the way at the

00:21:00.326 --> 00:21:00.756 A:middle
bottom.

00:21:02.226 --> 00:21:05.106 A:middle
So, I'm going to rerun this just

00:21:05.106 --> 00:21:06.736 A:middle
to verify that we still get the

00:21:06.736 --> 00:21:08.206 A:middle
QuickType bar showing up.

00:21:08.696 --> 00:21:10.166 A:middle
We don't expect anything to have

00:21:10.166 --> 00:21:12.596 A:middle
changed because iOS was already

00:21:12.596 --> 00:21:13.416 A:middle
detecting it.

00:21:13.416 --> 00:21:14.506 A:middle
But it's good to make sure.

00:21:15.906 --> 00:21:18.816 A:middle
So now, once the login screen

00:21:18.816 --> 00:21:22.276 A:middle
comes up, we can tap in and we

00:21:22.336 --> 00:21:23.566 A:middle
still get the QuickType bar,

00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:24.456 A:middle
which is great.

00:21:25.146 --> 00:21:27.476 A:middle
So now, to get the credentials

00:21:27.476 --> 00:21:29.746 A:middle
showing up, we need to tell iOS

00:21:30.486 --> 00:21:32.366 A:middle
that our app and our website are

00:21:32.456 --> 00:21:33.166 A:middle
associated.

00:21:33.586 --> 00:21:35.496 A:middle
And to do this, we'll adopt the

00:21:35.496 --> 00:21:37.776 A:middle
web credentials associated

00:21:37.776 --> 00:21:38.606 A:middle
domain service.

00:21:39.646 --> 00:21:42.326 A:middle
So, to do this, the first step,

00:21:42.326 --> 00:21:45.616 A:middle
is to make our app tell iOS what

00:21:45.616 --> 00:21:47.406 A:middle
websites it's associated with.

00:21:48.296 --> 00:21:49.736 A:middle
So we'll go here to the

00:21:49.736 --> 00:21:52.416 A:middle
Capabilities tab in our app and

00:21:52.416 --> 00:21:54.336 A:middle
turn on Associated Domains.

00:21:55.706 --> 00:21:58.726 A:middle
So now I have the ability to add

00:21:58.726 --> 00:22:01.456 A:middle
domains that my app is

00:21:58.726 --> 00:22:01.456 A:middle
domains that my app is

00:22:01.456 --> 00:22:03.256 A:middle
associated with.

00:22:03.256 --> 00:22:05.136 A:middle
So click the Plus button and

00:22:05.136 --> 00:22:08.866 A:middle
Xcode as a placeholder domain

00:22:08.866 --> 00:22:09.266 A:middle
for me.

00:22:09.626 --> 00:22:11.836 A:middle
So it has the web credentials

00:22:11.836 --> 00:22:13.766 A:middle
:prefix, because we're using the

00:22:13.766 --> 00:22:14.976 A:middle
web credential service.

00:22:15.526 --> 00:22:17.176 A:middle
And then you will replace

00:22:17.246 --> 00:22:19.886 A:middle
example.com with the domain your

00:22:19.886 --> 00:22:21.746 A:middle
app is associated with.

00:22:21.746 --> 00:22:23.426 A:middle
So my app is associated with

00:22:23.496 --> 00:22:26.206 A:middle
Shiny.example.com.

00:22:27.096 --> 00:22:29.676 A:middle
And when you add a domain, Xcode

00:22:29.676 --> 00:22:30.776 A:middle
will do two things.

00:22:31.486 --> 00:22:33.196 A:middle
The first is it adds an

00:22:33.196 --> 00:22:34.976 A:middle
entitlement to your entitlements

00:22:34.976 --> 00:22:36.776 A:middle
file so that when your app is

00:22:36.776 --> 00:22:39.256 A:middle
installed iOS will look at this

00:22:39.256 --> 00:22:41.316 A:middle
list of domains and go to each

00:22:41.316 --> 00:22:42.766 A:middle
one of them to find the

00:22:43.076 --> 00:22:45.036 A:middle
Apple-App-Site-Association file.

00:22:45.886 --> 00:22:47.586 A:middle
The second thing it does is it

00:22:47.586 --> 00:22:49.806 A:middle
makes sure that your app has

00:22:49.806 --> 00:22:51.586 A:middle
associated domains enabled.

00:22:52.466 --> 00:22:54.606 A:middle
So if your app ID does not have

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:56.246 A:middle
this enabled, you won't see a

00:22:56.246 --> 00:22:57.966 A:middle
checkmark next to this second

00:22:57.966 --> 00:22:58.336 A:middle
thing.

00:22:58.486 --> 00:23:00.106 A:middle
It will have an error.

00:22:58.486 --> 00:23:00.106 A:middle
It will have an error.

00:23:00.736 --> 00:23:02.466 A:middle
So, if you see an error there,

00:23:02.466 --> 00:23:03.836 A:middle
it's really easy to fix.

00:23:04.326 --> 00:23:05.496 A:middle
You just need to go to the

00:23:05.496 --> 00:23:07.496 A:middle
Developer Portal, select your

00:23:07.676 --> 00:23:09.826 A:middle
app ID, and turn on Associated

00:23:09.826 --> 00:23:10.366 A:middle
Domains.

00:23:10.916 --> 00:23:12.286 A:middle
And then it will be fixed.

00:23:12.986 --> 00:23:15.506 A:middle
So that is all we had to do to

00:23:15.506 --> 00:23:18.976 A:middle
tell iOS that our app is

00:23:18.976 --> 00:23:20.616 A:middle
associated with our website.

00:23:20.616 --> 00:23:22.586 A:middle
But now we need to make our

00:23:22.586 --> 00:23:25.206 A:middle
website agree and point back to

00:23:25.206 --> 00:23:26.786 A:middle
our app so that iOS can

00:23:26.786 --> 00:23:28.286 A:middle
establish the two-way link.

00:23:28.726 --> 00:23:31.306 A:middle
So to do this, I'll create an

00:23:31.306 --> 00:23:33.446 A:middle
Apple App Site association file.

00:23:34.566 --> 00:23:37.106 A:middle
So, here's some JSON that

00:23:37.106 --> 00:23:39.496 A:middle
specifies we're using the web

00:23:39.496 --> 00:23:41.326 A:middle
credential service, which

00:23:41.326 --> 00:23:43.196 A:middle
matches what we saw in Xcode.

00:23:44.036 --> 00:23:45.736 A:middle
Then within this dictionary is a

00:23:45.736 --> 00:23:48.296 A:middle
list of all the app IDs of the

00:23:48.296 --> 00:23:50.216 A:middle
apps our website is associated

00:23:50.216 --> 00:23:50.436 A:middle
with.

00:23:51.126 --> 00:23:52.876 A:middle
And my website only knows about

00:23:52.876 --> 00:23:54.196 A:middle
the Shiny app.

00:23:54.346 --> 00:23:56.506 A:middle
So its app ID consists of the

00:23:56.506 --> 00:23:58.886 A:middle
Team Identifier, which you can

00:23:58.886 --> 00:24:00.496 A:middle
find on the Developer Portal,

00:23:58.886 --> 00:24:00.496 A:middle
find on the Developer Portal,

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:03.446 A:middle
followed by a period, and then

00:24:03.446 --> 00:24:04.776 A:middle
your bundle identifier.

00:24:05.676 --> 00:24:06.756 A:middle
So let's save that.

00:24:07.196 --> 00:24:08.956 A:middle
And now I need to get it onto my

00:24:08.956 --> 00:24:09.776 A:middle
server.

00:24:10.176 --> 00:24:11.946 A:middle
And this step might look

00:24:11.946 --> 00:24:13.296 A:middle
different for you depending on

00:24:13.296 --> 00:24:14.566 A:middle
how your website is set up.

00:24:15.146 --> 00:24:17.386 A:middle
But I'm just going to use SCP to

00:24:17.386 --> 00:24:18.736 A:middle
copy it up there, to the

00:24:18.876 --> 00:24:20.386 A:middle
.well-known subdirectory.

00:24:21.336 --> 00:24:22.446 A:middle
Great. So it's up there.

00:24:22.446 --> 00:24:24.066 A:middle
And then just to double check,

00:24:24.066 --> 00:24:27.546 A:middle
I'm going to go into Safari and

00:24:27.546 --> 00:24:29.716 A:middle
visit the site that iOS is going

00:24:29.716 --> 00:24:30.246 A:middle
to look at.

00:24:30.756 --> 00:24:33.006 A:middle
So it's HTTPS

00:24:33.006 --> 00:24:37.036 A:middle
Shiny.example.com/.well-known/

00:24:37.556 --> 00:24:39.726 A:middle
apple-app-site-association.

00:24:39.726 --> 00:24:42.176 A:middle
And when I go there, it's great.

00:24:42.176 --> 00:24:45.216 A:middle
I see the JSON recreated.

00:24:45.376 --> 00:24:47.106 A:middle
And I don't see any smart

00:24:47.106 --> 00:24:48.866 A:middle
quotes, which could cause the

00:24:48.866 --> 00:24:50.666 A:middle
JSON to be malformed and

00:24:50.786 --> 00:24:51.786 A:middle
therefore it wouldn't work.

00:24:52.486 --> 00:24:54.136 A:middle
So, it looks like we're all set.

00:24:54.756 --> 00:24:57.136 A:middle
We've set up our app to point to

00:24:57.136 --> 00:24:57.806 A:middle
our website.

00:24:58.186 --> 00:25:00.696 A:middle
Our website to point to our app.

00:24:58.186 --> 00:25:00.696 A:middle
Our website to point to our app.

00:25:00.696 --> 00:25:03.196 A:middle
So let's rerun this and see that

00:25:03.196 --> 00:25:04.696 A:middle
we get the credentials we want

00:25:05.116 --> 00:25:06.936 A:middle
showing up on the QuickType bar.

00:25:07.746 --> 00:25:09.006 A:middle
And when you're testing this on

00:25:09.006 --> 00:25:10.966 A:middle
your apps, make sure to test it

00:25:11.026 --> 00:25:13.156 A:middle
on a device, because Associated

00:25:13.156 --> 00:25:14.916 A:middle
Domains is a device-only

00:25:14.916 --> 00:25:15.376 A:middle
feature.

00:25:15.976 --> 00:25:18.836 A:middle
So here we are back in our app.

00:25:18.836 --> 00:25:20.366 A:middle
I tap in the username field.

00:25:20.366 --> 00:25:22.396 A:middle
Great! We have the credentials

00:25:22.396 --> 00:25:23.866 A:middle
right there on the QuickType

00:25:23.896 --> 00:25:24.196 A:middle
bar.

00:25:24.726 --> 00:25:27.536 A:middle
So my users can tap, fill them

00:25:27.536 --> 00:25:30.196 A:middle
in, one more tap, and then they

00:25:30.196 --> 00:25:31.596 A:middle
get to see a really adorable

00:25:31.596 --> 00:25:32.096 A:middle
puppy.

00:25:32.806 --> 00:25:34.116 A:middle
So that's how easy it is to

00:25:34.116 --> 00:25:36.346 A:middle
guarantee that Password AutoFill

00:25:36.346 --> 00:25:37.966 A:middle
will work in your app.

00:25:37.966 --> 00:25:39.376 A:middle
And that the credentials your

00:25:39.376 --> 00:25:41.576 A:middle
users need will show up on the

00:25:41.576 --> 00:25:43.546 A:middle
QuickType bar to get them logged

00:25:43.546 --> 00:25:44.386 A:middle
in really quickly.

00:25:45.066 --> 00:25:46.376 A:middle
So now I'll hand it back over to

00:25:46.376 --> 00:25:47.436 A:middle
Ricky to tell you more.

00:25:48.516 --> 00:25:54.756 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:25:55.256 --> 00:25:56.016 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Maureen.

00:25:56.156 --> 00:25:57.176 A:middle
That was really cool.

00:25:59.696 --> 00:26:01.916 A:middle
Maureen just showed you just how

00:25:59.696 --> 00:26:01.916 A:middle
Maureen just showed you just how

00:26:01.986 --> 00:26:04.226 A:middle
easy it is to set text content

00:26:04.226 --> 00:26:06.406 A:middle
types from within Xcode.

00:26:08.816 --> 00:26:11.686 A:middle
She also showed you how to add

00:26:11.686 --> 00:26:13.666 A:middle
the web credentials associated

00:26:13.666 --> 00:26:15.706 A:middle
domain capability in your app's

00:26:15.736 --> 00:26:16.526 A:middle
Capabilities tab.

00:26:17.306 --> 00:26:18.296 A:middle
And she told you that that

00:26:18.296 --> 00:26:19.836 A:middle
capability gets signed into your

00:26:19.836 --> 00:26:20.646 A:middle
app's binary.

00:26:21.226 --> 00:26:23.286 A:middle
And if you need to enable the

00:26:23.286 --> 00:26:25.056 A:middle
associated domains feature on

00:26:25.056 --> 00:26:26.696 A:middle
the Developer Portal, it's

00:26:26.696 --> 00:26:27.666 A:middle
really easy to find.

00:26:27.916 --> 00:26:29.366 A:middle
I'll show you how to do it.

00:26:29.916 --> 00:26:31.746 A:middle
First, you navigate to the

00:26:31.746 --> 00:26:32.466 A:middle
Developer Portal.

00:26:33.376 --> 00:26:35.186 A:middle
And from there you can click on

00:26:35.186 --> 00:26:37.256 A:middle
Certificates, Identifiers and

00:26:37.256 --> 00:26:39.356 A:middle
Profiles, either in the side bar

00:26:39.576 --> 00:26:40.736 A:middle
or in the main content area.

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:44.066 A:middle
And from there you can select

00:26:44.066 --> 00:26:45.726 A:middle
App IDs and look at a list of

00:26:45.726 --> 00:26:47.336 A:middle
app IDs that are associated with

00:26:47.336 --> 00:26:48.206 A:middle
your developer account.

00:26:48.206 --> 00:26:50.746 A:middle
And from there, if you select

00:26:50.886 --> 00:26:51.686 A:middle
the app ID that you'd like to

00:26:51.686 --> 00:26:53.636 A:middle
modify, you'll see a list of

00:26:53.636 --> 00:26:55.246 A:middle
services that can be enabled for

00:26:55.246 --> 00:26:56.516 A:middle
your app.

00:26:56.516 --> 00:26:57.536 A:middle
And from there you can click the

00:26:57.536 --> 00:26:59.806 A:middle
Edit button and check the

00:26:59.806 --> 00:27:01.366 A:middle
Associated Domains checkbox.

00:26:59.806 --> 00:27:01.366 A:middle
Associated Domains checkbox.

00:27:01.966 --> 00:27:04.386 A:middle
And that's it.

00:27:04.646 --> 00:27:06.866 A:middle
You also saw just how easy it is

00:27:06.866 --> 00:27:07.566 A:middle
to construct an

00:27:07.566 --> 00:27:09.806 A:middle
Apple-App-Site-Association that

00:27:09.806 --> 00:27:12.276 A:middle
points back to your app from

00:27:12.276 --> 00:27:12.876 A:middle
your website.

00:27:13.436 --> 00:27:14.836 A:middle
It's just a few lines of JSON.

00:27:16.816 --> 00:27:19.816 A:middle
Maureen then uploaded that JSON

00:27:19.816 --> 00:27:21.596 A:middle
file to be served from the

00:27:21.656 --> 00:27:23.516 A:middle
.well-known standard directory

00:27:23.596 --> 00:27:25.176 A:middle
at the root of her web server.

00:27:26.236 --> 00:27:27.586 A:middle
You could also serve this file

00:27:27.586 --> 00:27:29.696 A:middle
from the root of the web server,

00:27:29.696 --> 00:27:30.996 A:middle
but the well-known directory is

00:27:31.026 --> 00:27:31.416 A:middle
preferred.

00:27:31.976 --> 00:27:34.646 A:middle
And if this linkage doesn't work

00:27:34.646 --> 00:27:35.866 A:middle
the first time that you try it,

00:27:36.376 --> 00:27:38.286 A:middle
if you build and run your app

00:27:38.286 --> 00:27:39.126 A:middle
and you're not seeing

00:27:39.126 --> 00:27:40.336 A:middle
credentials showing up on the

00:27:40.336 --> 00:27:42.236 A:middle
QuickType bar, we have a few

00:27:42.236 --> 00:27:43.336 A:middle
steps for you to help the bug.

00:27:43.806 --> 00:27:49.576 A:middle
The SWCD daemon will log

00:27:49.576 --> 00:27:50.836 A:middle
information about making

00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:52.376 A:middle
requests for setting up

00:27:52.516 --> 00:27:53.976 A:middle
associations between your app

00:27:53.976 --> 00:27:56.456 A:middle
and website on your device every

00:27:56.456 --> 00:27:57.696 A:middle
time that you build and run your

00:27:57.696 --> 00:27:57.816 A:middle
app.

00:27:58.806 --> 00:28:00.046 A:middle
So if something's not working,

00:27:58.806 --> 00:28:00.046 A:middle
So if something's not working,

00:28:00.316 --> 00:28:02.376 A:middle
plug your device in, open up

00:28:02.376 --> 00:28:04.996 A:middle
Console, and select the device

00:28:04.996 --> 00:28:06.386 A:middle
in the side bar and look for

00:28:06.386 --> 00:28:07.866 A:middle
logging from SWCD.

00:28:08.586 --> 00:28:10.936 A:middle
On the slide right now you can

00:28:10.936 --> 00:28:11.826 A:middle
see what happens when I

00:28:11.826 --> 00:28:13.156 A:middle
accidentally put

00:28:13.156 --> 00:28:15.536 A:middle
wrong.example.com as my

00:28:15.536 --> 00:28:17.096 A:middle
associated domain inside of

00:28:17.136 --> 00:28:17.526 A:middle
Xcode.

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:19.076 A:middle
It wasn't able to find an

00:28:19.076 --> 00:28:20.616 A:middle
Apple-App-Site-Association file.

00:28:22.056 --> 00:28:23.616 A:middle
But as soon as I corrected that

00:28:23.616 --> 00:28:26.676 A:middle
to Shiny.example.com iOS was

00:28:26.676 --> 00:28:27.586 A:middle
able to find the

00:28:27.676 --> 00:28:29.216 A:middle
Apple-App-Site-Association file,

00:28:29.656 --> 00:28:31.926 A:middle
verify the two-way link, and

00:28:31.926 --> 00:28:34.496 A:middle
from there iOS can offer the

00:28:34.496 --> 00:28:35.956 A:middle
exact right credentials that

00:28:35.956 --> 00:28:37.066 A:middle
your users are looking for

00:28:37.546 --> 00:28:38.836 A:middle
directly on the QuickType bar.

00:28:39.316 --> 00:28:44.036 A:middle
And at this point you pretty

00:28:44.036 --> 00:28:45.886 A:middle
much have all of the information

00:28:45.886 --> 00:28:47.416 A:middle
that you need to know to make

00:28:47.416 --> 00:28:49.436 A:middle
Password AutoFill work really

00:28:49.436 --> 00:28:51.306 A:middle
well in your app.

00:28:51.306 --> 00:28:52.546 A:middle
I'm hoping that this is one of

00:28:52.546 --> 00:28:54.076 A:middle
the easiest to adopt features

00:28:54.366 --> 00:28:55.426 A:middle
that you've ever wanted to

00:28:55.426 --> 00:28:55.866 A:middle
adopt.

00:28:57.016 --> 00:28:58.956 A:middle
But before we wrap things up, I

00:28:58.956 --> 00:29:00.086 A:middle
just want to quickly touch on a

00:28:58.956 --> 00:29:00.086 A:middle
just want to quickly touch on a

00:29:00.086 --> 00:29:01.226 A:middle
few related topics to

00:29:01.226 --> 00:29:02.856 A:middle
authentication and passwords,

00:29:03.376 --> 00:29:04.166 A:middle
because since you're here,

00:29:04.166 --> 00:29:05.346 A:middle
you're probably interested in

00:29:05.346 --> 00:29:05.536 A:middle
them.

00:29:06.006 --> 00:29:09.676 A:middle
And the first is about viewing,

00:29:09.816 --> 00:29:11.966 A:middle
saving, and adding new passwords

00:29:11.966 --> 00:29:12.686 A:middle
on iOS.

00:29:14.266 --> 00:29:16.126 A:middle
So besides Password AutoFill, we

00:29:16.126 --> 00:29:17.786 A:middle
made another change related to

00:29:17.786 --> 00:29:18.816 A:middle
iCloud Keychain this year.

00:29:19.326 --> 00:29:21.836 A:middle
And that was to move the list of

00:29:21.836 --> 00:29:23.146 A:middle
passwords that you could find in

00:29:23.146 --> 00:29:25.156 A:middle
Settings up to a more prominent

00:29:25.156 --> 00:29:27.136 A:middle
location at the top level called

00:29:27.136 --> 00:29:28.946 A:middle
Accounts and Passwords.

00:29:30.126 --> 00:29:33.006 A:middle
Inside of that section, users

00:29:33.006 --> 00:29:34.346 A:middle
will be able to authenticate

00:29:34.346 --> 00:29:36.826 A:middle
with Touch ID, of course, to

00:29:36.826 --> 00:29:38.236 A:middle
view a list of their safe

00:29:38.236 --> 00:29:39.696 A:middle
passwords, and add new

00:29:39.696 --> 00:29:40.286 A:middle
passwords.

00:29:41.566 --> 00:29:43.166 A:middle
Now, after all of you have

00:29:43.166 --> 00:29:44.566 A:middle
adopted Password AutoFill in

00:29:44.566 --> 00:29:46.266 A:middle
your apps, users aren't going to

00:29:46.266 --> 00:29:47.836 A:middle
have a ton of reasons to come in

00:29:47.836 --> 00:29:49.446 A:middle
here to copy and paste passwords

00:29:49.446 --> 00:29:49.856 A:middle
anymore.

00:29:50.776 --> 00:29:51.816 A:middle
But it can still be useful to

00:29:51.816 --> 00:29:53.436 A:middle
look up a password if you need

00:29:53.436 --> 00:29:54.946 A:middle
to enter it on a friend's device

00:29:54.996 --> 00:29:56.096 A:middle
where you don't have your iCloud

00:29:56.096 --> 00:29:56.536 A:middle
Keychain.

00:29:57.116 --> 00:30:01.706 A:middle
Okay, this whole time we've been

00:29:57.116 --> 00:30:01.706 A:middle
Okay, this whole time we've been

00:30:01.706 --> 00:30:03.226 A:middle
talking about a specific type of

00:30:03.226 --> 00:30:05.546 A:middle
authentication, where your app

00:30:05.546 --> 00:30:06.866 A:middle
and your website, they're the

00:30:06.866 --> 00:30:07.676 A:middle
same entity.

00:30:07.676 --> 00:30:08.846 A:middle
You're logging into a service

00:30:08.846 --> 00:30:10.536 A:middle
that you or your company owns.

00:30:11.506 --> 00:30:12.236 A:middle
But I know that there's a

00:30:12.236 --> 00:30:13.746 A:middle
different type of authentication

00:30:14.196 --> 00:30:16.316 A:middle
that a bunch of you need, which

00:30:16.316 --> 00:30:17.786 A:middle
is to log into a third party

00:30:17.786 --> 00:30:19.536 A:middle
service like a popular social

00:30:21.336 --> 00:30:22.186 A:middle
network.

00:30:22.186 --> 00:30:23.266 A:middle
iOS's solution for

00:30:23.266 --> 00:30:25.046 A:middle
authenticating against a social

00:30:25.046 --> 00:30:27.386 A:middle
network using a technique like

00:30:27.446 --> 00:30:29.766 A:middle
o-Off is Safari View Controller.

00:30:30.436 --> 00:30:32.146 A:middle
And the reason for that is that

00:30:32.146 --> 00:30:33.366 A:middle
Safari View controller has

00:30:33.366 --> 00:30:35.186 A:middle
Safari's AutoFill feature, which

00:30:35.186 --> 00:30:36.226 A:middle
makes it really easy to get

00:30:36.226 --> 00:30:36.846 A:middle
logged in.

00:30:37.506 --> 00:30:39.436 A:middle
And also, Safari View Controller

00:30:39.436 --> 00:30:41.496 A:middle
is sandboxed away from the third

00:30:41.496 --> 00:30:43.706 A:middle
party app, which gives the

00:30:43.706 --> 00:30:44.486 A:middle
service that's being

00:30:44.486 --> 00:30:46.186 A:middle
authenticated to a sort of

00:30:46.186 --> 00:30:47.796 A:middle
guarantee about the security of

00:30:47.796 --> 00:30:48.496 A:middle
the passwords.

00:30:49.136 --> 00:30:52.496 A:middle
In iOS 11 Safari View Controller

00:30:52.496 --> 00:30:53.396 A:middle
has been revamped.

00:30:54.196 --> 00:30:56.076 A:middle
It has a new look that you can

00:30:56.076 --> 00:30:57.926 A:middle
customize to make it feel more

00:30:57.926 --> 00:30:59.386 A:middle
like part of your application.

00:31:00.336 --> 00:31:02.266 A:middle
So here you're seeing a demo app

00:31:02.426 --> 00:31:03.456 A:middle
presenting a Safari View

00:31:03.456 --> 00:31:04.936 A:middle
Controller tinted blue and

00:31:04.936 --> 00:31:05.126 A:middle
white.

00:31:05.576 --> 00:31:06.506 A:middle
It doesn't look very much like

00:31:06.506 --> 00:31:06.936 A:middle
Safari.

00:31:06.966 --> 00:31:08.356 A:middle
It looks like the app itself.

00:31:09.006 --> 00:31:11.006 A:middle
And what this app has also done

00:31:11.476 --> 00:31:12.966 A:middle
is change the top left corner

00:31:12.966 --> 00:31:14.246 A:middle
button of the Safari View

00:31:14.246 --> 00:31:16.126 A:middle
Controller to say Cancel instead

00:31:16.126 --> 00:31:16.516 A:middle
of Done.

00:31:17.436 --> 00:31:18.396 A:middle
Because when Safari View

00:31:18.396 --> 00:31:19.756 A:middle
Controller is being used for

00:31:19.756 --> 00:31:21.666 A:middle
authentication, dismissing the

00:31:21.666 --> 00:31:22.736 A:middle
Safari View Controller is

00:31:22.736 --> 00:31:24.536 A:middle
cancelling the action of logging

00:31:24.536 --> 00:31:24.746 A:middle
in.

00:31:25.086 --> 00:31:26.266 A:middle
It's not actually successfully

00:31:26.266 --> 00:31:27.026 A:middle
finishing anything.

00:31:27.026 --> 00:31:30.246 A:middle
So Done doesn't make sense.

00:31:30.416 --> 00:31:31.616 A:middle
To learn about even more

00:31:31.616 --> 00:31:33.566 A:middle
customizations to Safari View

00:31:33.566 --> 00:31:35.136 A:middle
Controller, and how to implement

00:31:35.136 --> 00:31:36.446 A:middle
what I just showed you, you

00:31:36.446 --> 00:31:37.546 A:middle
should definitely check out the

00:31:37.546 --> 00:31:39.126 A:middle
session tomorrow at 10 a.m.

00:31:39.466 --> 00:31:40.826 A:middle
What's New in Safari View

00:31:40.826 --> 00:31:41.276 A:middle
Controller.

00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:43.826 A:middle
And if you want to learn more

00:31:43.826 --> 00:31:45.636 A:middle
information about implementing

00:31:45.636 --> 00:31:47.376 A:middle
an o-OFF flow yourself using

00:31:47.376 --> 00:31:49.386 A:middle
Safari View Controller, you can

00:31:49.386 --> 00:31:51.056 A:middle
go back to the 2015 session

00:31:51.106 --> 00:31:52.176 A:middle
Introducing Safari View

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:52.596 A:middle
Controller.

00:31:53.836 --> 00:31:54.766 A:middle
You might not even be

00:31:54.766 --> 00:31:55.816 A:middle
implementing a Safari View

00:31:55.816 --> 00:31:57.486 A:middle
Controller yourself to do o-Off,

00:31:57.786 --> 00:31:59.246 A:middle
it might actually come for free

00:31:59.246 --> 00:32:00.666 A:middle
as part of an SDK you're using

00:31:59.246 --> 00:32:00.666 A:middle
as part of an SDK you're using

00:32:00.666 --> 00:32:01.486 A:middle
for authentication.

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:02.666 A:middle
So that's worth knowing.

00:32:04.276 --> 00:32:04.866 A:middle
All right.

00:32:05.376 --> 00:32:07.866 A:middle
Let's talk about everything that

00:32:07.866 --> 00:32:08.686 A:middle
we've covered so far.

00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:13.916 A:middle
Friction when logging in can

00:32:13.916 --> 00:32:15.336 A:middle
lead users to abandoning your

00:32:15.336 --> 00:32:15.546 A:middle
app.

00:32:16.056 --> 00:32:16.756 A:middle
And we don't want that.

00:32:16.976 --> 00:32:17.876 A:middle
Your apps are awesome.

00:32:17.876 --> 00:32:19.116 A:middle
We want users to use them.

00:32:20.056 --> 00:32:21.826 A:middle
But fortunately in iOS 11,

00:32:22.156 --> 00:32:23.486 A:middle
Password AutoFill is there to

00:32:23.486 --> 00:32:23.766 A:middle
help.

00:32:24.526 --> 00:32:26.046 A:middle
And Password AutoFill uses

00:32:26.046 --> 00:32:28.446 A:middle
heuristics to work automatically

00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:30.106 A:middle
in many of your apps without you

00:32:30.106 --> 00:32:31.336 A:middle
having to make any changes.

00:32:31.866 --> 00:32:34.266 A:middle
But to give your users the best

00:32:34.266 --> 00:32:36.176 A:middle
experience, and to guarantee

00:32:36.176 --> 00:32:37.786 A:middle
that it works now and in the

00:32:37.786 --> 00:32:39.736 A:middle
future, you can take a few

00:32:39.736 --> 00:32:40.386 A:middle
simple steps.

00:32:41.576 --> 00:32:44.386 A:middle
The first is to install one of

00:32:44.386 --> 00:32:46.006 A:middle
the betas on your phone and run

00:32:46.006 --> 00:32:47.256 A:middle
your app and see what your

00:32:47.256 --> 00:32:48.026 A:middle
starting place is.

00:32:49.416 --> 00:32:51.076 A:middle
From there, you can adopt the

00:32:51.076 --> 00:32:52.806 A:middle
username and password text

00:32:52.806 --> 00:32:53.616 A:middle
content types.

00:32:54.376 --> 00:32:56.306 A:middle
That will guarantee that even if

00:32:56.426 --> 00:32:58.086 A:middle
iOS or your view hierarchy

00:32:58.086 --> 00:32:59.426 A:middle
changes a few years from now

00:32:59.816 --> 00:33:01.116 A:middle
Password AutoFill will still be

00:32:59.816 --> 00:33:01.116 A:middle
Password AutoFill will still be

00:33:01.116 --> 00:33:01.486 A:middle
offered.

00:33:02.156 --> 00:33:03.306 A:middle
So if you take three minutes to

00:33:03.306 --> 00:33:04.896 A:middle
do this now, you might save

00:33:04.896 --> 00:33:06.136 A:middle
yourself a bug a few years from

00:33:06.136 --> 00:33:06.286 A:middle
now.

00:33:06.846 --> 00:33:09.846 A:middle
And then finally, by adopting

00:33:09.846 --> 00:33:11.486 A:middle
the webcredentials Associated

00:33:11.486 --> 00:33:13.586 A:middle
Domain service you can set up a

00:33:13.586 --> 00:33:15.576 A:middle
tight two-way link between your

00:33:15.686 --> 00:33:16.516 A:middle
app and your website.

00:33:16.516 --> 00:33:19.156 A:middle
And that will enable iOS to

00:33:19.436 --> 00:33:20.566 A:middle
offer the exact right

00:33:20.566 --> 00:33:22.196 A:middle
credentials that your users are

00:33:22.196 --> 00:33:23.416 A:middle
looking for, that they've

00:33:23.416 --> 00:33:24.826 A:middle
already saved in Safari and

00:33:24.826 --> 00:33:26.616 A:middle
iCloud Keychain directly on the

00:33:26.616 --> 00:33:28.486 A:middle
keyboard in your apps.

00:33:30.416 --> 00:33:32.336 A:middle
And if you run into any issues

00:33:32.466 --> 00:33:34.056 A:middle
adopting Password AutoFill this

00:33:34.056 --> 00:33:36.296 A:middle
summer, and you can't fix them

00:33:36.336 --> 00:33:37.816 A:middle
by taking one of the steps that

00:33:37.816 --> 00:33:39.926 A:middle
I just outlined, please send us

00:33:39.926 --> 00:33:40.326 A:middle
feedback.

00:33:40.556 --> 00:33:41.486 A:middle
Please file bugs.

00:33:42.326 --> 00:33:43.726 A:middle
We need your help to make sure

00:33:43.726 --> 00:33:45.096 A:middle
that users are getting the best

00:33:45.096 --> 00:33:46.866 A:middle
experience in your app and in

00:33:46.866 --> 00:33:48.026 A:middle
the apps of everyone in this

00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:48.286 A:middle
room.

00:33:49.516 --> 00:33:50.776 A:middle
Your feedback really helps us

00:33:50.776 --> 00:33:52.386 A:middle
prioritize our work.

00:33:54.586 --> 00:33:55.856 A:middle
For more information about

00:33:55.856 --> 00:33:57.436 A:middle
Password AutoFill, you can check

00:33:57.436 --> 00:33:58.796 A:middle
out this web page on the

00:33:58.796 --> 00:33:59.596 A:middle
Developer website.

00:34:00.136 --> 00:34:02.426 A:middle
And we have some awesome related

00:34:02.426 --> 00:34:03.236 A:middle
sessions this year.

00:34:04.006 --> 00:34:05.136 A:middle
I already talked about the

00:34:05.136 --> 00:34:06.546 A:middle
Safari View Controller sessions.

00:34:07.266 --> 00:34:10.166 A:middle
But on Friday morning there is a

00:34:10.166 --> 00:34:11.356 A:middle
session that's about making the

00:34:11.356 --> 00:34:12.876 A:middle
keyboard entry experience in

00:34:12.876 --> 00:34:13.996 A:middle
your app magical.

00:34:14.516 --> 00:34:15.536 A:middle
I encourage you to check it out.

00:34:15.536 --> 00:34:16.806 A:middle
All right.

00:34:17.096 --> 00:34:18.226 A:middle
Thank you so much everybody.

00:34:18.226 --> 00:34:19.985 A:middle
I hope you have an amazing WWDC.

00:34:21.516 --> 00:34:27.639 A:middle
