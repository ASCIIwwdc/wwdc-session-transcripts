00:00:17.886 --> 00:00:19.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; What are deep links, and how

00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:20.716 A:middle
can they be used to extend the

00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:21.736 A:middle
presence of your app?

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:23.586 A:middle
Let's start with your app.

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:25.226 A:middle
It consists of information like

00:00:25.226 --> 00:00:27.076 A:middle
videos, photos, or maybe places

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:29.096 A:middle
and locations, as well as

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:30.586 A:middle
functions like watching a video,

00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:32.156 A:middle
getting directions, or sharing

00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:32.756 A:middle
information.

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:34.866 A:middle
The typical user experience

00:00:34.936 --> 00:00:35.896 A:middle
involves knowing that the

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:37.496 A:middle
content or function exists in

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:38.986 A:middle
your app; then, navigating

00:00:38.986 --> 00:00:40.456 A:middle
through some hierarchy of use in

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:41.186 A:middle
order to find it.

00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:43.126 A:middle
This is called the user journey

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:44.066 A:middle
or user activity.

00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:46.516 A:middle
Deep links are a way to offer

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:48.216 A:middle
direct access to the content and

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:49.356 A:middle
functions in your app.

00:00:50.226 --> 00:00:51.526 A:middle
The way it works is your app is

00:00:51.526 --> 00:00:53.566 A:middle
launched, you receive a link,

00:00:53.776 --> 00:00:54.726 A:middle
and the app displays the

00:00:54.726 --> 00:00:55.206 A:middle
content.

00:00:55.986 --> 00:00:57.246 A:middle
The same can be done to complete

00:00:57.246 --> 00:00:58.236 A:middle
a function in your app

00:00:58.326 --> 00:00:58.976 A:middle
automatically.

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:01.436 A:middle
Here's an example of launching a

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:02.606 A:middle
video from a deep link.

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.296 A:middle
Note the transitions to orient

00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:06.876 A:middle
the user where they are within

00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:07.146 A:middle
the app.

00:01:07.756 --> 00:01:09.136 A:middle
This helps the user establish

00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:11.316 A:middle
their place and subtly reminds

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:12.526 A:middle
them of how they can navigate

00:01:12.576 --> 00:01:12.866 A:middle
back.

00:01:14.236 --> 00:01:15.606 A:middle
The way you format a deep link

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:17.066 A:middle
is called a Universal Link.

00:01:18.116 --> 00:01:19.576 A:middle
This is a secure mapping that

00:01:19.576 --> 00:01:21.476 A:middle
launches your app.

00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:23.436 A:middle
Best of all, they are universal,

00:01:23.796 --> 00:01:24.666 A:middle
and if your app is not

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:25.896 A:middle
installed, it can always fall

00:01:25.896 --> 00:01:26.676 A:middle
back to Safari.

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:28.946 A:middle
Here's what it looks like.

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:31.866 A:middle
You have a scheme like https, a

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.046 A:middle
domain, which is the same as

00:01:33.046 --> 00:01:34.626 A:middle
your website, and a path to the

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:35.186 A:middle
resource.

00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:38.306 A:middle
The way you get started with

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:39.456 A:middle
Deep Links is you add an

00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:41.036 A:middle
entitlement for all web domains

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:42.046 A:middle
that your app supports.

00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:44.116 A:middle
You create an app-site

00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:45.786 A:middle
association file, which is an

00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:46.836 A:middle
adjacent file which contains

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:48.276 A:middle
data about the URLs that your

00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:48.886 A:middle
app can handle.

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.276 A:middle
You then upload that

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.866 A:middle
app-site-association file to

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.346 A:middle
your web server and implement

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:54.936 A:middle
the continueUserActivity method

00:01:54.936 --> 00:01:55.816 A:middle
in your App Delegate.

00:01:55.996 --> 00:01:57.126 A:middle
This will pass you a

00:01:57.126 --> 00:01:58.906 A:middle
UserActivity object, which will

00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:00.846 A:middle
contain a URL for your Universal

00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:00.846 A:middle
contain a URL for your Universal

00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:01.116 A:middle
Link.

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:03.256 A:middle
There are many times you are

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:04.476 A:middle
going to want a deep link to

00:02:04.476 --> 00:02:06.016 A:middle
somewhere in your app, and by

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:08.096 A:middle
using Universal Links, you have

00:02:08.096 --> 00:02:09.476 A:middle
one clean and simple way of

00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:09.916 A:middle
doing that.

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:11.926 A:middle
This presents many opportunities

00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:13.566 A:middle
to help new users discover your

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:14.636 A:middle
app through its content.

00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:17.186 A:middle
For example, you can enable a

00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:18.726 A:middle
user to share content on social

00:02:18.726 --> 00:02:20.786 A:middle
media, in messaging or email

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:22.106 A:middle
with Universal Link.

00:02:22.556 --> 00:02:24.176 A:middle
You can create those links on

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:25.796 A:middle
the web, on your website, or

00:02:25.796 --> 00:02:26.866 A:middle
others can link to it from their

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.936 A:middle
website, and it can be

00:02:28.936 --> 00:02:30.156 A:middle
catalogued in Search like

00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:30.636 A:middle
Spotlight.

00:02:31.946 --> 00:02:33.656 A:middle
Universal Links are also a way

00:02:33.656 --> 00:02:35.066 A:middle
to encourage more engagement of

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:35.466 A:middle
you app.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.306 A:middle
The first way is to have your

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:38.996 A:middle
app be recommended in Siri App

00:02:38.996 --> 00:02:40.666 A:middle
Suggestions and Hand Off by

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:41.706 A:middle
registering your own

00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:42.776 A:middle
NSUserActivities.

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:45.666 A:middle
You can create Deep Links in a

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:46.956 A:middle
lock screen, which to make your

00:02:46.956 --> 00:02:48.506 A:middle
content, just a swipe and tap

00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:48.836 A:middle
away.

00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:51.006 A:middle
You can launch straight to the

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:52.566 A:middle
content of your app from the App

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:53.986 A:middle
icon with Quick Actions.

00:02:55.086 --> 00:02:56.396 A:middle
If your app contains content

00:02:56.396 --> 00:02:57.746 A:middle
supported by SiriKit, you can

00:02:57.746 --> 00:02:59.266 A:middle
map these to Universal Links.

00:03:00.596 --> 00:03:01.856 A:middle
Other apps can contain your

00:03:01.856 --> 00:03:03.586 A:middle
Universal Links, which can pass

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:04.666 A:middle
information to your app.

00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:07.566 A:middle
If you integrate with the TV

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:08.956 A:middle
app, then you can use Universal

00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:09.346 A:middle
Links.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:11.286 A:middle
A caveat here is that animation

00:03:11.286 --> 00:03:13.126 A:middle
is not necessary because the

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.596 A:middle
system readies the interface for

00:03:14.596 --> 00:03:15.996 A:middle
video content before launching

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:16.346 A:middle
your app.

00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:19.536 A:middle
So, in summary, create Deep

00:03:19.536 --> 00:03:21.106 A:middle
Links to all the app's content

00:03:21.106 --> 00:03:22.186 A:middle
and functions that it makes

00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:24.486 A:middle
sense for; create a catalog of

00:03:24.486 --> 00:03:26.176 A:middle
these using Universal Links;

00:03:26.946 --> 00:03:28.406 A:middle
expose all your links to

00:03:28.406 --> 00:03:29.816 A:middle
increase discoverability and

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:31.006 A:middle
engagement of your content.

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:33.086 A:middle
Finally, when launching a

00:03:33.086 --> 00:03:34.896 A:middle
Universal Link, use animation to

00:03:34.896 --> 00:03:36.596 A:middle
help keep the user oriented.

00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:38.696 A:middle
For more information, see the

00:03:38.696 --> 00:03:40.176 A:middle
resource section of this video.

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:41.406 A:middle
Thank you.
