00:00:21.096 --> 00:00:22.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, designing for iOS used to

00:00:22.596 --> 00:00:24.226 A:middle
be a lot more simple.

00:00:24.556 --> 00:00:25.706 A:middle
There was only one phone.

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:28.396 A:middle
We now have three different

00:00:28.396 --> 00:00:31.036 A:middle
screen sizes for iPhone and

00:00:31.036 --> 00:00:33.826 A:middle
three iPad sizes, with different

00:00:33.826 --> 00:00:36.806 A:middle
orientations, and split screens,

00:00:36.806 --> 00:00:38.206 A:middle
and multitasking screens.

00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:41.196 A:middle
And that might seem like a lot

00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:42.326 A:middle
of different screen sizes to

00:00:42.326 --> 00:00:44.016 A:middle
consider, but there's a basic

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:45.746 A:middle
framework for designing and

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:46.976 A:middle
building your app that

00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:48.076 A:middle
simplifies the process.

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:51.566 A:middle
This will save you time and your

00:00:51.656 --> 00:00:53.726 A:middle
app will look great regardless

00:00:53.726 --> 00:00:55.546 A:middle
of what device people are using.

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:58.826 A:middle
The key things to consider are

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:00.836 A:middle
organizing your screens into

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:00.836 A:middle
organizing your screens into

00:01:00.896 --> 00:01:03.276 A:middle
size classes, using Dynamic

00:01:03.336 --> 00:01:06.006 A:middle
Type, and taking advantage of

00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:07.386 A:middle
standard UI elements.

00:01:08.156 --> 00:01:09.786 A:middle
And all of these things are

00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:10.956 A:middle
meant to make it easier for you

00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:12.436 A:middle
to design and build your app.

00:01:13.446 --> 00:01:15.086 A:middle
So, first let's take a look at

00:01:15.086 --> 00:01:15.596 A:middle
size classes.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:18.466 A:middle
All screen sizes -- all iOS

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:20.836 A:middle
screen dimensions fall under one

00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:23.516 A:middle
of two size classes, compact or

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:24.006 A:middle
regular.

00:01:24.906 --> 00:01:26.226 A:middle
And an easy way to think about

00:01:26.276 --> 00:01:27.786 A:middle
this is that the narrower screen

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:29.946 A:middle
widths are compact size, like an

00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:30.916 A:middle
iPhone layout.

00:01:31.406 --> 00:01:33.116 A:middle
And a wider screen widths are

00:01:33.116 --> 00:01:34.786 A:middle
regular like the width of an

00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:35.316 A:middle
iPad.

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:37.866 A:middle
If you stack all of the screens

00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:39.886 A:middle
on top of each other, in both

00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:42.446 A:middle
portrait and in landscape

00:01:42.446 --> 00:01:44.356 A:middle
orientations you can see that

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:46.366 A:middle
size class applies to both width

00:01:46.436 --> 00:01:46.936 A:middle
and height.

00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:49.446 A:middle
The goal of creating these two

00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:51.706 A:middle
size classes is so that layouts

00:01:51.756 --> 00:01:54.456 A:middle
will be flexible and elements

00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:56.006 A:middle
will adapt relative to their

00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:56.776 A:middle
screen size.

00:01:58.256 --> 00:01:59.256 A:middle
So let me give you a couple

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:01.136 A:middle
examples of what that might

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:01.136 A:middle
examples of what that might

00:02:01.196 --> 00:02:02.376 A:middle
potentially mean for your

00:02:02.376 --> 00:02:02.766 A:middle
layout.

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:07.156 A:middle
The iPhone 7 Plus in landscape,

00:02:07.156 --> 00:02:09.966 A:middle
falls under regular width, which

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:11.616 A:middle
allows it to use Split Views

00:02:11.746 --> 00:02:12.776 A:middle
like all of the iPads.

00:02:12.776 --> 00:02:15.936 A:middle
And the two smaller phones in

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.096 A:middle
landscape are compact in both

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:18.946 A:middle
width and height.

00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:21.786 A:middle
This means they will get shorter

00:02:21.786 --> 00:02:24.106 A:middle
landscape bar heights than the

00:02:24.226 --> 00:02:25.506 A:middle
standard height that you see in

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:25.976 A:middle
portrait.

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:29.866 A:middle
Screen widths also define UIKit

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:32.616 A:middle
margins and margin, the margin

00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:34.986 A:middle
widths can either be standard or

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:37.096 A:middle
like this iPad generous for

00:02:37.096 --> 00:02:37.816 A:middle
wider screens.

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:40.746 A:middle
But in this example and a lot of

00:02:40.746 --> 00:02:44.036 A:middle
other cases, text, if text went

00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:45.586 A:middle
edge to edge with the UIKit

00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:47.516 A:middle
margins then the lines of text

00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:49.626 A:middle
would be too long making it hard

00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:51.136 A:middle
for the eye to jump down when

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:53.166 A:middle
you get to the end of a line.

00:02:54.926 --> 00:02:56.436 A:middle
So, we use readability margins

00:02:56.846 --> 00:02:58.346 A:middle
to restrict the line lengths on

00:02:58.346 --> 00:02:59.216 A:middle
larger devices.

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:01.546 A:middle
These margins are flexible

00:03:01.546 --> 00:03:02.776 A:middle
because they can vary with the

00:03:02.776 --> 00:03:03.476 A:middle
text size.

00:03:04.746 --> 00:03:06.286 A:middle
And smaller text needs more

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.616 A:middle
narrow readability lengths, and

00:03:08.616 --> 00:03:10.116 A:middle
larger text can have longer

00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:10.546 A:middle
lengths.

00:03:11.466 --> 00:03:13.156 A:middle
And if you're using Dynamic Type

00:03:13.306 --> 00:03:14.986 A:middle
with readability margins, then

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.226 A:middle
people using your app will have

00:03:16.226 --> 00:03:17.636 A:middle
a much more comfortable reading

00:03:17.636 --> 00:03:18.166 A:middle
experience.

00:03:19.806 --> 00:03:20.926 A:middle
So, let's talk more about

00:03:21.016 --> 00:03:23.676 A:middle
Dynamic Type, what it is and how

00:03:23.676 --> 00:03:26.656 A:middle
it can help people use your app.

00:03:27.046 --> 00:03:29.286 A:middle
Dynamic Type are predefined text

00:03:29.286 --> 00:03:31.786 A:middle
styles that can be scaled on a

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:33.826 A:middle
device so that people can see

00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:35.316 A:middle
text at a size that is most

00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:36.206 A:middle
comfortable for them.

00:03:36.206 --> 00:03:38.176 A:middle
And there are a lot of people

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.416 A:middle
who find text in their apps to

00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:41.926 A:middle
be way too small to read.

00:03:42.436 --> 00:03:44.806 A:middle
So, using Dynamic Type will

00:03:44.806 --> 00:03:46.486 A:middle
automatically allow text to

00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:48.566 A:middle
scale up or down without

00:03:48.566 --> 00:03:49.746 A:middle
compromising your layout.

00:03:49.746 --> 00:03:52.646 A:middle
And it also makes opting in

00:03:52.646 --> 00:03:54.446 A:middle
Accessibility Settings for even

00:03:54.446 --> 00:03:56.336 A:middle
larger type, much easier.

00:03:58.116 --> 00:03:59.586 A:middle
It also makes localizing your

00:03:59.586 --> 00:04:00.286 A:middle
app seamless.

00:03:59.586 --> 00:04:00.286 A:middle
app seamless.

00:04:00.796 --> 00:04:01.816 A:middle
Your text will adjust the

00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:03.826 A:middle
lettering, or line height based

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:05.066 A:middle
on the height of the characters.

00:04:05.466 --> 00:04:06.836 A:middle
So using these features will

00:04:06.836 --> 00:04:08.096 A:middle
only make it easier for more

00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:10.316 A:middle
people to use your app.

00:04:11.546 --> 00:04:12.866 A:middle
So, this is our Dynamic Type

00:04:12.956 --> 00:04:13.316 A:middle
chart.

00:04:14.026 --> 00:04:15.366 A:middle
And this year, we've made some

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:17.086 A:middle
adjustments to our existing text

00:04:17.086 --> 00:04:18.986 A:middle
styles by increasing the weight

00:04:18.986 --> 00:04:20.926 A:middle
of Title sizes from light to

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:21.805 A:middle
regular.

00:04:22.426 --> 00:04:24.586 A:middle
In most cases, we recommend

00:04:24.586 --> 00:04:26.876 A:middle
using two to three of these text

00:04:26.876 --> 00:04:28.376 A:middle
styles per screen.

00:04:29.026 --> 00:04:30.306 A:middle
But with ten different text

00:04:30.306 --> 00:04:32.316 A:middle
styles to choose from, there are

00:04:32.316 --> 00:04:33.806 A:middle
countless combinations and a lot

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:35.486 A:middle
of flexibility when you're

00:04:35.486 --> 00:04:37.956 A:middle
designing your app.

00:04:38.276 --> 00:04:39.686 A:middle
The names of the text styles are

00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:40.756 A:middle
meant to be descriptive,

00:04:41.346 --> 00:04:43.606 A:middle
suggesting where certain styles

00:04:43.636 --> 00:04:45.066 A:middle
are most appropriately used.

00:04:45.996 --> 00:04:47.926 A:middle
So for instance, Body is

00:04:47.926 --> 00:04:49.986 A:middle
intended to be used in places

00:04:49.986 --> 00:04:51.576 A:middle
where large bodies of text are

00:04:51.576 --> 00:04:51.916 A:middle
needed.

00:04:52.416 --> 00:04:53.716 A:middle
And Body is also the default

00:04:53.716 --> 00:04:54.806 A:middle
that we use throughout the

00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:55.326 A:middle
system.

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.216 A:middle
And from there, we can introduce

00:04:58.486 --> 00:05:00.776 A:middle
smaller and larger styles, or in

00:04:58.486 --> 00:05:00.776 A:middle
smaller and larger styles, or in

00:05:00.776 --> 00:05:03.366 A:middle
this case bolder, to create

00:05:03.366 --> 00:05:03.776 A:middle
hierarchy.

00:05:05.566 --> 00:05:06.546 A:middle
But what if you're using a

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:07.996 A:middle
custom font in your design?

00:05:09.136 --> 00:05:11.486 A:middle
So, this year, with our new API

00:05:11.876 --> 00:05:13.536 A:middle
we have, we can make custom

00:05:13.536 --> 00:05:15.216 A:middle
fonts Dynamic as well, which is

00:05:15.216 --> 00:05:15.616 A:middle
great.

00:05:16.106 --> 00:05:17.576 A:middle
Keep in mind that you may have

00:05:17.576 --> 00:05:19.406 A:middle
to design -- assign different

00:05:19.446 --> 00:05:21.236 A:middle
point sizes for each text style

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:23.196 A:middle
because not all fonts have the

00:05:23.266 --> 00:05:24.106 A:middle
same proportions.

00:05:24.106 --> 00:05:26.396 A:middle
And this is important for

00:05:26.396 --> 00:05:27.886 A:middle
keeping your text optically the

00:05:27.886 --> 00:05:28.536 A:middle
same size.

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:32.046 A:middle
Etsy is a good example of an app

00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:33.456 A:middle
that uses Dynamic Type.

00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:35.616 A:middle
Here it is at its default size,

00:05:36.996 --> 00:05:38.686 A:middle
and here it is at a much larger

00:05:38.686 --> 00:05:40.466 A:middle
size, and it looks great.

00:05:41.776 --> 00:05:43.906 A:middle
So, last but not least, let's

00:05:43.946 --> 00:05:45.536 A:middle
discuss UIKit Elements.

00:05:47.216 --> 00:05:49.106 A:middle
Rather than focusing effort on

00:05:49.106 --> 00:05:50.706 A:middle
designing a task or function

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:52.526 A:middle
that people are already familiar

00:05:52.526 --> 00:05:54.296 A:middle
with, we want you to be able to

00:05:54.296 --> 00:05:55.966 A:middle
focus your time designing what

00:05:55.966 --> 00:05:57.326 A:middle
makes your app unique.

00:05:58.286 --> 00:05:59.636 A:middle
We have a bunch of standard UI

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:01.076 A:middle
elements that you can use in

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:01.076 A:middle
elements that you can use in

00:06:01.076 --> 00:06:02.716 A:middle
your app that will automatically

00:06:02.816 --> 00:06:04.476 A:middle
adapt on all screen sizes.

00:06:05.206 --> 00:06:06.306 A:middle
So, this includes things like

00:06:06.306 --> 00:06:08.236 A:middle
TableViews which not only scale

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:10.216 A:middle
nicely with Dynamic Type, it

00:06:10.216 --> 00:06:11.556 A:middle
also inherits readability

00:06:11.556 --> 00:06:12.856 A:middle
margins and standard

00:06:12.856 --> 00:06:14.286 A:middle
interactions, like swipe

00:06:14.286 --> 00:06:15.656 A:middle
actions, and edit mode.

00:06:17.136 --> 00:06:18.116 A:middle
And there are a lot of other

00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:20.186 A:middle
resources that will help enforce

00:06:20.306 --> 00:06:22.536 A:middle
consistency and adapt seamlessly

00:06:22.536 --> 00:06:23.556 A:middle
across devices.

00:06:24.806 --> 00:06:26.526 A:middle
It's important to note that all

00:06:26.526 --> 00:06:28.066 A:middle
of these components are scaled

00:06:28.116 --> 00:06:31.266 A:middle
for iOS 7, which is the size

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:32.666 A:middle
that we recommend you start a

00:06:32.666 --> 00:06:33.436 A:middle
new design.

00:06:34.786 --> 00:06:36.376 A:middle
Once you have an iPhone design

00:06:36.836 --> 00:06:38.016 A:middle
we have a couple tips for

00:06:38.016 --> 00:06:39.266 A:middle
adapting it to iPad.

00:06:41.066 --> 00:06:42.776 A:middle
So, going back for a minute, we

00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:44.546 A:middle
now know that regular size

00:06:44.686 --> 00:06:47.256 A:middle
classes or iPads can use Split

00:06:47.256 --> 00:06:49.676 A:middle
Views and to maintain content

00:06:49.736 --> 00:06:51.476 A:middle
hierarchy between iPhone and

00:06:51.596 --> 00:06:53.696 A:middle
iPad consider how your app will

00:06:53.696 --> 00:06:54.366 A:middle
relay out.

00:06:55.866 --> 00:06:57.186 A:middle
The left side of the Split View

00:06:57.326 --> 00:06:59.266 A:middle
can be referred to as the Master

00:06:59.266 --> 00:06:59.596 A:middle
View.

00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:02.236 A:middle
And on the right is the Detail

00:07:02.236 --> 00:07:02.416 A:middle
View.

00:07:02.416 --> 00:07:05.126 A:middle
And the Detail View on an iPhone

00:07:05.876 --> 00:07:06.916 A:middle
would be the page you have to

00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:08.586 A:middle
drill down further to see.

00:07:10.206 --> 00:07:11.716 A:middle
Remember, an iPad will share

00:07:11.716 --> 00:07:14.836 A:middle
both iPad and iPhone specific

00:07:14.836 --> 00:07:17.326 A:middle
layouts and iPad layouts should

00:07:17.326 --> 00:07:18.486 A:middle
maintain the same level of

00:07:18.596 --> 00:07:20.586 A:middle
hierarchy as the iPhone layout

00:07:20.856 --> 00:07:22.516 A:middle
including standard navigation,

00:07:22.906 --> 00:07:24.066 A:middle
toolbars, and tab bars.

00:07:25.286 --> 00:07:26.376 A:middle
If your app has enabled

00:07:26.376 --> 00:07:28.316 A:middle
multitasking, this will create

00:07:28.316 --> 00:07:30.116 A:middle
consistency when your app has to

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:32.866 A:middle
coexist with another app.

00:07:33.246 --> 00:07:34.966 A:middle
And while in multitasking your

00:07:34.966 --> 00:07:36.296 A:middle
app will transition back and

00:07:36.376 --> 00:07:39.226 A:middle
forth between the iPhone layout

00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:41.856 A:middle
or compact, and back to regular

00:07:41.856 --> 00:07:43.836 A:middle
size classes depending on its

00:07:44.136 --> 00:07:45.186 A:middle
current screen width.

00:07:46.906 --> 00:07:47.976 A:middle
Okay, so to recap.

00:07:48.896 --> 00:07:50.546 A:middle
When designing for iOS, it's

00:07:50.546 --> 00:07:51.706 A:middle
important to keep these three

00:07:51.706 --> 00:07:52.526 A:middle
things in mind.

00:07:53.846 --> 00:07:55.876 A:middle
Considering size class will make

00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:58.156 A:middle
your app look amazing regardless

00:07:58.386 --> 00:08:00.036 A:middle
of what device people are using.

00:07:58.386 --> 00:08:00.036 A:middle
of what device people are using.

00:08:01.016 --> 00:08:03.086 A:middle
Using Dynamic Type will make it

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:05.936 A:middle
easy for your text to scale and

00:08:06.026 --> 00:08:06.946 A:middle
translate to different

00:08:06.946 --> 00:08:08.946 A:middle
languages, and this will enable

00:08:09.096 --> 00:08:11.446 A:middle
more people to use your app.

00:08:12.176 --> 00:08:13.906 A:middle
And taking advantage of existing

00:08:13.906 --> 00:08:15.766 A:middle
UI elements will free you up

00:08:15.866 --> 00:08:17.566 A:middle
from redesigning and rebuilding

00:08:17.566 --> 00:08:19.346 A:middle
features that people might

00:08:19.346 --> 00:08:20.416 A:middle
already be familiar with.

00:08:21.986 --> 00:08:22.896 A:middle
We encourage you to take

00:08:22.896 --> 00:08:24.476 A:middle
advantage of these tools, not

00:08:24.476 --> 00:08:26.336 A:middle
only to save you time, but so

00:08:26.336 --> 00:08:28.246 A:middle
that regardless of what iOS app

00:08:29.156 --> 00:08:30.466 A:middle
people are using, your app

00:08:30.596 --> 00:08:32.086 A:middle
experience will be seamless.

00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:33.796 A:middle
Thank you.
