&gt;&gt; Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:27.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:29.526 A:middle
I hope everybody's having a

00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:31.306 A:middle
great WWDC so far and that some

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:33.026 A:middle
of you managed to go see Todd's

00:00:33.026 --> 00:00:34.626 A:middle
talk just a little bit ago, he's

00:00:34.626 --> 00:00:35.796 A:middle
a great speaker and an

00:00:35.796 --> 00:00:37.406 A:middle
all-around awesome dude, so I

00:00:37.406 --> 00:00:38.226 A:middle
hope you enjoyed that.

My name is Skylar Peterson, I am

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.676 A:middle
a member of Apple's iOS

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.596 A:middle
Accessibility Team and I'm here

00:00:45.596 --> 00:00:46.946 A:middle
today to talk to you about

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:48.486 A:middle
what's new in accessibility this

00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:48.656 A:middle
year.

00:00:50.576 --> 00:00:52.246 A:middle
So, for those of you that don't

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:53.936 A:middle
know exactly what I mean when I

00:00:53.936 --> 00:00:56.046 A:middle
say accessibility well first of

00:00:56.046 --> 00:00:57.456 A:middle
all, I'm happy that you're here

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:00.366 A:middle
and second, when we think about

00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:03.266 A:middle
Accessibility it's really making

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.016 A:middle
technology usable by everyone

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.536 A:middle
regardless of whatever their

00:01:07.536 --> 00:01:08.996 A:middle
unique needs might be.

00:01:09.396 --> 00:01:11.776 A:middle
At Apple, we approach this

00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:14.106 A:middle
problem by examining four major

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:16.116 A:middle
classes of user ability,

00:01:17.516 --> 00:01:19.816 A:middle
cognitive, motor, vision and

00:01:19.816 --> 00:01:19.966 A:middle
hearing.

00:01:25.056 --> 00:01:27.206 A:middle
Cognitive encompasses conditions

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:30.106 A:middle
like dyslexia or autism.

00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:34.166 A:middle
Motor examines the way in which

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.806 A:middle
a user physically interacts with

00:01:35.806 --> 00:01:37.556 A:middle
the system, whether they need

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:38.836 A:middle
special accommodations for a

00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:40.506 A:middle
condition like Parkinson's or

00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:41.346 A:middle
cerebral palsy.

00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:46.946 A:middle
Vision which encompasses a range

00:01:46.976 --> 00:01:48.966 A:middle
of visionability from those with

00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:51.016 A:middle
low vision conditions to those

00:01:51.016 --> 00:01:52.006 A:middle
who are completely blind.

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:56.016 A:middle
And finally hearing which like

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:59.006 A:middle
vision encompasses a spectrum of

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:01.146 A:middle
hearing ability from those who

00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:02.946 A:middle
are hard of hearing to those

00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:06.326 A:middle
that are completely deaf.

00:02:06.776 --> 00:02:09.176 A:middle
Worldwide there are over a

00:02:09.176 --> 00:02:11.756 A:middle
billion people who have some

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:13.236 A:middle
form of disability that fit into

00:02:13.236 --> 00:02:14.416 A:middle
one of those categories.

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:17.996 A:middle
Put another way, one in seven,

00:02:18.926 --> 00:02:21.626 A:middle
one in seven people have a form

00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:23.886 A:middle
of disability which means that

00:02:23.886 --> 00:02:25.786 A:middle
you're going to have and already

00:02:25.786 --> 00:02:27.806 A:middle
do have users that have a

00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:28.506 A:middle
disability.

00:02:29.626 --> 00:02:30.736 A:middle
But at the end of the day

00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:32.436 A:middle
accessibility isn't about

00:02:32.436 --> 00:02:35.536 A:middle
numbers it's about people.

00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:38.476 A:middle
Accessibility is about the way

00:02:38.476 --> 00:02:39.846 A:middle
in which people interact with

00:02:39.846 --> 00:02:40.256 A:middle
the world.

00:02:42.256 --> 00:02:44.146 A:middle
It's about technology's

00:02:44.146 --> 00:02:46.776 A:middle
transformative power to enable.

00:02:49.026 --> 00:02:50.296 A:middle
It's about expanding the

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:52.706 A:middle
possibilities of what people can

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:52.986 A:middle
do.

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:56.156 A:middle
Accessibility is full of

00:02:56.156 --> 00:02:58.316 A:middle
incredible stories, stories like

00:02:58.316 --> 00:02:58.606 A:middle
Todd's.

00:03:00.426 --> 00:03:01.986 A:middle
In fact, we availed a video

00:03:01.986 --> 00:03:03.466 A:middle
series highlighting some of

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:05.176 A:middle
these stories and I'd like to

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:06.356 A:middle
share one of them with you now.

00:03:14.286 --> 00:03:14.976 A:middle

when they understand and get

something, you can actually see

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:52.176 A:middle

actually it sounds like they're

00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:33.886 A:middle

00:05:21.346 --> 00:05:23.166 A:middle
problems that people like Shane

00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:25.176 A:middle
face every day by creating a

00:05:25.176 --> 00:05:27.666 A:middle
wide array of baked in

00:05:27.776 --> 00:05:30.326 A:middle
system-level features across all

00:05:30.326 --> 00:05:31.396 A:middle
of our platforms.

00:05:32.646 --> 00:05:34.056 A:middle
Which includes making sure that

00:05:34.056 --> 00:05:36.396 A:middle
our software works well with an

00:05:36.396 --> 00:05:37.306 A:middle
assortment of hardware

for people with disabilities.

00:05:41.646 --> 00:05:45.016 A:middle
But at the end of the day what

00:05:45.016 --> 00:05:46.756 A:middle
really makes Apple's platforms

00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:49.466 A:middle
great is the work that people

00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:51.976 A:middle
like you do every day to make

sure that all of those amazing

00:05:54.216 --> 00:05:55.896 A:middle
bits of content that you work on

work for everyone.

00:05:58.626 --> 00:06:01.276 A:middle
So, with that in mind, let's

00:06:01.276 --> 00:06:03.176 A:middle
take a look at what we're going

00:06:03.176 --> 00:06:03.936 A:middle
to talk about today.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.496 A:middle
The first thing I'd like to do

00:06:06.736 --> 00:06:07.916 A:middle
is highlight some of our new

00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:09.316 A:middle
assistive features across all of

00:06:09.316 --> 00:06:10.206 A:middle
our platforms.

00:06:10.706 --> 00:06:12.526 A:middle
And from there I'd like to shift

00:06:12.826 --> 00:06:14.916 A:middle
to talking about what you as a

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.086 A:middle
developer can do to make sure

00:06:17.086 --> 00:06:19.076 A:middle
that your stuff works with our

00:06:19.076 --> 00:06:19.586 A:middle
stuff.

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:22.136 A:middle
And that really starts by

00:06:22.136 --> 00:06:23.686 A:middle
auditing your own app for

00:06:23.686 --> 00:06:25.586 A:middle
accessibility, looking at what

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:26.866 A:middle
the current accessibility

experience is like.

00:06:29.596 --> 00:06:31.116 A:middle
And from there we're going to

00:06:31.116 --> 00:06:32.136 A:middle
take a look at some of the

00:06:32.136 --> 00:06:34.116 A:middle
basics of our accessibility API

00:06:34.116 --> 00:06:36.476 A:middle
and the way that you can take

00:06:36.476 --> 00:06:38.246 A:middle
advantage of it to solve some of

00:06:38.246 --> 00:06:39.586 A:middle
the issues you find during your

00:06:40.386 --> 00:06:40.506 A:middle
audit.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:43.576 A:middle
From there we're going to go

00:06:43.576 --> 00:06:45.066 A:middle
beyond the basics to look at

00:06:45.066 --> 00:06:46.736 A:middle
some of our more advanced APIs

00:06:46.736 --> 00:06:48.216 A:middle
to help you solve some common

00:06:48.216 --> 00:06:49.466 A:middle
problems that you might find

00:06:50.046 --> 00:06:51.016 A:middle
while making your own apps

00:06:51.016 --> 00:06:51.556 A:middle
accessible.

00:06:51.626 --> 00:06:55.416 A:middle
And finally, I'd like to spend a

00:06:55.416 --> 00:06:57.306 A:middle
little bit of time talking about

00:06:57.306 --> 00:06:58.126 A:middle
some accessibility

00:06:58.126 --> 00:06:59.256 A:middle
considerations that you should

00:06:59.256 --> 00:07:01.526 A:middle
make when implementing the

00:07:01.526 --> 00:07:03.746 A:middle
drag-and-drop in iOS 11.

00:07:04.986 --> 00:07:05.896 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:09.926 A:middle
The first feature I'd like to

00:07:09.926 --> 00:07:11.786 A:middle
talk about today is text

00:07:11.786 --> 00:07:12.286 A:middle
detection.

00:07:13.196 --> 00:07:15.566 A:middle
So, let's imagine for a second

00:07:15.946 --> 00:07:17.676 A:middle
that you're a VoiceOver user

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.376 A:middle
who's blind and you're scrolling

00:07:20.376 --> 00:07:22.086 A:middle
through your favorite social

00:07:22.086 --> 00:07:23.806 A:middle
media app and you come across an

00:07:23.806 --> 00:07:25.596 A:middle
image like this where somebody

00:07:25.886 --> 00:07:27.526 A:middle
has embedded text within an

00:07:27.526 --> 00:07:27.926 A:middle
image.

00:07:28.606 --> 00:07:29.346 A:middle
When you tap on it you're

00:07:29.346 --> 00:07:30.866 A:middle
probably not going to hear a

00:07:30.866 --> 00:07:32.216 A:middle
description of what's actually

00:07:32.216 --> 00:07:33.136 A:middle
in the image unless the

00:07:33.136 --> 00:07:34.456 A:middle
developer has gone through and

00:07:34.456 --> 00:07:36.566 A:middle
done the work to put a label

00:07:36.566 --> 00:07:37.726 A:middle
that describes it to you.

00:07:37.986 --> 00:07:41.656 A:middle
But this year in iOS 11, as well

00:07:41.656 --> 00:07:45.166 A:middle
as on macOS if you focus on an

00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:46.756 A:middle
image we're going to do some

00:07:46.756 --> 00:07:48.306 A:middle
basic text detection to try and

00:07:48.306 --> 00:07:49.776 A:middle
figure out if there's text

00:07:49.776 --> 00:07:51.416 A:middle
within that image and if it

00:07:51.416 --> 00:07:52.636 A:middle
makes sense to speak it then

00:07:52.636 --> 00:07:53.986 A:middle
we're going to speak to the user

00:07:54.066 --> 00:07:55.836 A:middle
and it sounds a little something

00:07:55.836 --> 00:07:57.016 A:middle
like this.

00:07:57.406 --> 00:07:58.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Possible text, I can't

00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:00.276 A:middle
believe I took this with my

00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:00.886 A:middle
iPhone.

00:08:01.556 --> 00:08:04.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now along that same vein,

00:08:04.686 --> 00:08:06.526 A:middle
we're introducing improved photo

00:08:06.526 --> 00:08:08.576 A:middle
descriptions for VoiceOver users

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:09.816 A:middle
systemwide.

00:08:10.536 --> 00:08:12.346 A:middle
So, when a VoiceOver user

00:08:12.346 --> 00:08:14.686 A:middle
focuses on an image we're going

00:08:14.686 --> 00:08:16.696 A:middle
to run some basic analysis to

00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:17.756 A:middle
try and figure out what's

00:08:17.756 --> 00:08:19.926 A:middle
contained within that image and

00:08:19.926 --> 00:08:21.966 A:middle
speak details about it so that

00:08:22.096 --> 00:08:23.706 A:middle
VoiceOver users get a richer

00:08:23.896 --> 00:08:24.446 A:middle
description.

00:08:25.306 --> 00:08:26.736 A:middle
We look for things like the

00:08:26.736 --> 00:08:28.436 A:middle
number of faces within an image,

00:08:28.846 --> 00:08:29.906 A:middle
what expressions are they

00:08:29.906 --> 00:08:32.066 A:middle
making, what's the overall scene

00:08:32.066 --> 00:08:33.576 A:middle
of that image, and what's its

00:08:33.576 --> 00:08:34.956 A:middle
blurriness or brightness level.

00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:36.996 A:middle
So, a description for an image

00:08:36.996 --> 00:08:38.636 A:middle
like this one might sound like

00:08:38.636 --> 00:08:38.966 A:middle
this.

00:08:40.366 --> 00:08:42.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; One face, one smiling,

00:08:42.696 --> 00:08:44.736 A:middle
nightclub, blurry, bright.

00:08:45.866 --> 00:08:47.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now if you're a developer

00:08:47.206 --> 00:08:48.406 A:middle
who's already gone through and

00:08:48.406 --> 00:08:49.766 A:middle
done your due diligence of

00:08:49.766 --> 00:08:51.316 A:middle
labeling all your images don't

00:08:51.316 --> 00:08:52.646 A:middle
worry we're not just going to

00:08:52.856 --> 00:08:54.436 A:middle
hijack that description from

00:08:54.436 --> 00:08:54.676 A:middle
you.

00:08:55.266 --> 00:08:57.416 A:middle
Instead, if a user wants to hear

00:08:57.416 --> 00:08:58.486 A:middle
the description that we

00:08:58.486 --> 00:09:00.146 A:middle
ourselves have generated that

00:09:00.146 --> 00:09:01.456 A:middle
all they need to do is a single

00:09:01.456 --> 00:09:02.886 A:middle
three-finger tap on the image

00:09:03.216 --> 00:09:03.976 A:middle
and they'll hear our

00:09:03.976 --> 00:09:04.486 A:middle
description.

00:09:08.796 --> 00:09:11.186 A:middle
Next, we have large texts.

00:09:11.596 --> 00:09:13.976 A:middle
So, this year our team did an

00:09:13.976 --> 00:09:15.566 A:middle
audit of the large text

00:09:15.566 --> 00:09:18.226 A:middle
experience systemwide with a

00:09:18.226 --> 00:09:20.956 A:middle
real focus on the experience of

00:09:20.956 --> 00:09:22.926 A:middle
those users who use our largest

00:09:22.926 --> 00:09:24.616 A:middle
accessibility text sizes.

00:09:24.816 --> 00:09:26.756 A:middle
And we worked with teams across

00:09:26.756 --> 00:09:28.596 A:middle
Apple to really, really improve

00:09:28.596 --> 00:09:30.176 A:middle
this experience, which also

00:09:30.176 --> 00:09:31.796 A:middle
includes some new APIs.

00:09:32.156 --> 00:09:34.346 A:middle
Now there's a lot that I could

00:09:34.346 --> 00:09:35.506 A:middle
say about this feature.

00:09:36.126 --> 00:09:37.776 A:middle
In fact, there's so much that I

00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:39.126 A:middle
could say about this feature

00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:40.836 A:middle
there's a whole other session

00:09:40.836 --> 00:09:42.936 A:middle
dedicated just to dynamic type

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:45.086 A:middle
it's called Building Apps with

00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:45.736 A:middle
Dynamic Type.

00:09:46.616 --> 00:09:47.416 A:middle
It's going to be in the

00:09:47.416 --> 00:09:49.346 A:middle
executive ballroom Friday at

00:09:49.346 --> 00:09:51.736 A:middle
1:50 and I highly, highly

00:09:51.736 --> 00:09:54.036 A:middle
recommend that you attend to

00:09:54.036 --> 00:09:55.586 A:middle
figure out how to best adapt

00:09:55.586 --> 00:09:57.896 A:middle
your own apps for dynamic type

00:09:58.106 --> 00:09:58.906 A:middle
in iOS 11.

00:09:59.356 --> 00:10:01.066 A:middle
Now there are two other sessions

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:02.286 A:middle
up here that I'd like to point

00:10:02.286 --> 00:10:04.856 A:middle
out that also contain relevant

00:10:04.856 --> 00:10:06.236 A:middle
information about dynamic type.

00:10:07.176 --> 00:10:09.496 A:middle
The first Design for Everyone is

00:10:09.496 --> 00:10:11.746 A:middle
a session that focuses on the

00:10:11.746 --> 00:10:13.936 A:middle
design of accessibility, but

00:10:13.936 --> 00:10:16.956 A:middle
will also contain a portion that

00:10:16.956 --> 00:10:18.326 A:middle
will cover dynamic type,

00:10:18.756 --> 00:10:20.286 A:middle
including some of the rationale

00:10:20.656 --> 00:10:22.386 A:middle
behind decisions that we made

00:10:22.606 --> 00:10:24.126 A:middle
when adapting the layouts for

00:10:24.126 --> 00:10:25.846 A:middle
large text and design

00:10:25.846 --> 00:10:27.236 A:middle
considerations that you yourself

00:10:27.236 --> 00:10:28.796 A:middle
should make when designing your

00:10:28.796 --> 00:10:29.426 A:middle
own apps.

00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:31.736 A:middle
And second, Auto Layout

00:10:31.736 --> 00:10:33.516 A:middle
Techniques in Interface Builder

00:10:33.786 --> 00:10:36.336 A:middle
will have a portion dedicated to

00:10:36.336 --> 00:10:37.936 A:middle
adapting your layouts that are

00:10:37.936 --> 00:10:40.116 A:middle
built with interface builder for

00:10:40.116 --> 00:10:40.776 A:middle
dynamic type.

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.776 A:middle
So, I hope to see you all at

00:10:44.616 --> 00:10:46.206 A:middle
these sessions.

00:10:46.866 --> 00:10:48.826 A:middle
Moving on, we have the

00:10:48.826 --> 00:10:50.466 A:middle
Accessibility keyboard.

00:10:51.286 --> 00:10:52.826 A:middle
This is a feature built for

00:10:52.826 --> 00:10:55.466 A:middle
macOS for users who have enough

00:10:55.466 --> 00:10:58.186 A:middle
dexterity to use a trackpad, but

00:10:58.186 --> 00:11:00.206 A:middle
can't necessarily use a physical

00:11:00.206 --> 00:11:00.746 A:middle
keyboard.

00:11:01.906 --> 00:11:03.816 A:middle
It's an onscreen keyboard that

00:11:03.816 --> 00:11:05.676 A:middle
has things like system controls

00:11:06.206 --> 00:11:08.786 A:middle
and a predictive text bar and is

00:11:08.786 --> 00:11:11.206 A:middle
fully customizable, which means

00:11:11.656 --> 00:11:13.756 A:middle
that if I have certain actions

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:15.946 A:middle
that I do on a daily basis that

00:11:15.946 --> 00:11:18.446 A:middle
I want to create a custom panel

00:11:18.446 --> 00:11:20.206 A:middle
for so I just have to click it

00:11:20.206 --> 00:11:21.636 A:middle
once and it'll initiate that

00:11:21.636 --> 00:11:23.236 A:middle
action then I can create those

00:11:23.236 --> 00:11:23.736 A:middle
panels.

00:11:24.406 --> 00:11:26.466 A:middle
So, for instance if I email my

00:11:26.466 --> 00:11:28.426 A:middle
manager every day I may create a

00:11:28.426 --> 00:11:30.426 A:middle
custom panel that opens mail,

00:11:31.026 --> 00:11:33.196 A:middle
composes an email, and adds her

00:11:33.196 --> 00:11:37.526 A:middle
address in there.

00:11:37.726 --> 00:11:41.326 A:middle
Next, we have Type to Siri, so

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.926 A:middle
like the title suggests this

00:11:42.926 --> 00:11:44.496 A:middle
feature allows you to interact

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.796 A:middle
with Siri via text input like

00:11:46.796 --> 00:11:48.456 A:middle
you would via speech.

00:11:48.886 --> 00:11:50.396 A:middle
And we're really excited about

00:11:50.396 --> 00:11:51.686 A:middle
this because it's going to open

00:11:51.686 --> 00:11:54.426 A:middle
up Siri to a class of users who

00:11:54.426 --> 00:11:55.856 A:middle
are unable to use it before,

00:11:56.106 --> 00:11:57.086 A:middle
those who are nonverbal.

00:12:00.456 --> 00:12:03.206 A:middle
Finally, we have Smart Invert

00:12:03.276 --> 00:12:03.826 A:middle
Colors.

00:12:04.836 --> 00:12:07.526 A:middle
So, previously on iOS if you

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:08.816 A:middle
enabled the invert colors

00:12:08.816 --> 00:12:10.756 A:middle
feature it would invert all the

00:12:10.756 --> 00:12:12.176 A:middle
content of your device

00:12:12.436 --> 00:12:13.576 A:middle
regardless of what kind of

00:12:13.576 --> 00:12:14.746 A:middle
content it is.

00:12:15.186 --> 00:12:16.346 A:middle
But this year we're introducing

00:12:16.346 --> 00:12:18.696 A:middle
Smart Invert Colors, which looks

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:20.216 A:middle
at specific kinds of content

00:12:20.216 --> 00:12:23.156 A:middle
like graphics or images and

00:12:23.156 --> 00:12:24.506 A:middle
doesn't invert them so that you

00:12:24.506 --> 00:12:25.966 A:middle
can see the content as it was

00:12:25.966 --> 00:12:26.886 A:middle
actually meant to be.

00:12:27.436 --> 00:12:28.886 A:middle
Now I'd actually like to do a

00:12:28.886 --> 00:12:29.896 A:middle
demo of that feature for you

00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:29.976 A:middle
now.

00:12:41.086 --> 00:12:42.916 A:middle
So, I have my device here and

00:12:42.916 --> 00:12:44.506 A:middle
I'm going to enable Smart Invert

00:12:44.506 --> 00:12:45.016 A:middle
Colors.

00:12:45.246 --> 00:12:48.776 A:middle
Now as you can see, the

00:12:48.776 --> 00:12:51.596 A:middle
wallpaper wasn't inverted nor

00:12:51.656 --> 00:12:53.156 A:middle
were all of the app icons.

00:12:53.366 --> 00:12:55.696 A:middle
And if I go into my Photos app,

00:12:56.546 --> 00:12:58.876 A:middle
you'll see that I still have the

00:12:58.876 --> 00:13:02.136 A:middle
dark UI that is important for

00:13:02.356 --> 00:13:04.586 A:middle
users who use invert colors that

00:13:04.586 --> 00:13:05.486 A:middle
have certain low-vision

00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:07.946 A:middle
conditions where a white UI

00:13:08.116 --> 00:13:09.496 A:middle
makes the display too difficult

00:13:09.496 --> 00:13:10.816 A:middle
to look at for prolonged periods

00:13:10.816 --> 00:13:11.186 A:middle
of time.

00:13:11.626 --> 00:13:14.836 A:middle
So, I can still see my photos as

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:15.816 A:middle
they originally were.

00:13:17.446 --> 00:13:20.416 A:middle
Now if I go to an app like Clock

00:13:20.496 --> 00:13:22.226 A:middle
which already had a dark UI

00:13:23.316 --> 00:13:24.936 A:middle
you'll also notice that we

00:13:24.936 --> 00:13:27.296 A:middle
haven't inverted that UI to keep

00:13:27.726 --> 00:13:30.096 A:middle
the dark look around that is so

00:13:30.096 --> 00:13:31.306 A:middle
important to our invert colors

00:13:31.306 --> 00:13:31.806 A:middle
users.

00:13:32.136 --> 00:13:34.186 A:middle
Now that's just a very basic

00:13:34.186 --> 00:13:36.426 A:middle
overview of that feature and I

00:13:36.486 --> 00:13:37.476 A:middle
highly recommend that you check

00:13:37.476 --> 00:13:39.036 A:middle
it out yourself and see how it

00:13:39.036 --> 00:13:40.596 A:middle
plays around with your own apps.

00:13:42.176 --> 00:13:46.906 A:middle
But now I'd like to pivot into

00:13:46.906 --> 00:13:49.096 A:middle
talking about the experience of

00:13:49.096 --> 00:13:51.086 A:middle
you as a developer and how you

00:13:51.086 --> 00:13:52.626 A:middle
make sure that all of your work

00:13:53.126 --> 00:13:54.366 A:middle
works with all the things that I

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:56.436 A:middle
just covered, as well as all of

00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:57.226 A:middle
our old features.

00:13:57.876 --> 00:13:59.826 A:middle
And that really begins by

00:13:59.826 --> 00:14:01.396 A:middle
auditing your app for

00:14:01.396 --> 00:14:02.126 A:middle
accessibility.

00:14:04.116 --> 00:14:06.076 A:middle
So, when we're starting an audit

00:14:06.786 --> 00:14:07.626 A:middle
the first thing you're going to

00:14:07.626 --> 00:14:09.466 A:middle
want to do is enable an

00:14:09.466 --> 00:14:10.816 A:middle
accessible technology like

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:13.036 A:middle
Voiceover or Switch Control and

00:14:13.086 --> 00:14:14.996 A:middle
see what the experience is like

00:14:15.456 --> 00:14:17.366 A:middle
for a Voiceover user.

00:14:17.916 --> 00:14:21.326 A:middle
So, to do that we're going to

00:14:21.326 --> 00:14:24.086 A:middle
tap on General Accessibility and

00:14:24.086 --> 00:14:25.636 A:middle
go down to this accessibility

00:14:25.636 --> 00:14:27.816 A:middle
shortcut page and add VoiceOver

00:14:27.816 --> 00:14:28.546 A:middle
to our shortcut.

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:32.496 A:middle
What this does is that now

00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:34.086 A:middle
whenever I triple click the Home

00:14:34.086 --> 00:14:36.176 A:middle
button VoiceOver will turn on

00:14:36.496 --> 00:14:37.916 A:middle
and if I have VoiceOver on

00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:39.206 A:middle
already it will turn VoiceOver

00:14:39.206 --> 00:14:41.476 A:middle
off so I can quickly cycle

00:14:41.476 --> 00:14:42.786 A:middle
between the two as I'm going

00:14:42.786 --> 00:14:44.326 A:middle
through my app.

00:14:45.236 --> 00:14:46.856 A:middle
And now that we have VoiceOver

00:14:46.856 --> 00:14:46.976 A:middle
on.

00:14:51.246 --> 00:14:52.206 A:middle
We're going to Home out of

00:14:52.206 --> 00:14:54.306 A:middle
settings and go to the app that

00:14:54.306 --> 00:14:56.956 A:middle
we want to audit and just start

00:14:57.006 --> 00:14:58.746 A:middle
playing around to see what the

00:14:58.746 --> 00:14:59.996 A:middle
experience is like for a

00:14:59.996 --> 00:15:01.006 A:middle
VoiceOver user.

00:15:02.176 --> 00:15:03.356 A:middle
Are all the things that I would

00:15:03.356 --> 00:15:05.356 A:middle
expect to be visible visible?

00:15:05.916 --> 00:15:08.076 A:middle
Are the things that I would not

00:15:08.076 --> 00:15:08.826 A:middle
want to be visible to a

00:15:08.826 --> 00:15:10.016 A:middle
VoiceOver user not visible to

00:15:10.016 --> 00:15:10.336 A:middle
them?

00:15:11.236 --> 00:15:12.726 A:middle
Does every interaction with the

00:15:12.726 --> 00:15:14.006 A:middle
interface have some sort of

00:15:14.006 --> 00:15:15.416 A:middle
corollary that a VoiceOver user

00:15:15.416 --> 00:15:16.306 A:middle
can take advantage of?

00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:20.216 A:middle
And does the UI itself make

00:15:20.266 --> 00:15:22.686 A:middle
sense, does the flow make sense?

00:15:23.866 --> 00:15:26.236 A:middle
As well are elements properly

00:15:26.236 --> 00:15:26.746 A:middle
labeled?

00:15:27.606 --> 00:15:28.856 A:middle
For instance, I would expect

00:15:29.486 --> 00:15:30.866 A:middle
this button that's an upload

00:15:30.866 --> 00:15:33.476 A:middle
button to be labeled upload tell

00:15:33.476 --> 00:15:35.046 A:middle
me it has three votes currently

00:15:35.046 --> 00:15:35.786 A:middle
and that it's a button.

00:15:38.306 --> 00:15:41.746 A:middle
Now we have a tool called the

00:15:41.746 --> 00:15:43.656 A:middle
Accessibility Inspector that can

00:15:43.656 --> 00:15:45.456 A:middle
also be used for auditing your

00:15:46.306 --> 00:15:46.416 A:middle
apps.

00:15:46.786 --> 00:15:50.176 A:middle
You can get to it by going to

00:15:50.876 --> 00:15:53.366 A:middle
Xcode, open Developer Tool and

00:15:53.366 --> 00:15:54.496 A:middle
opening the Accessibility

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:55.066 A:middle
Inspector.

00:15:55.586 --> 00:15:56.826 A:middle
And what this tool allows you to

00:15:56.826 --> 00:15:59.226 A:middle
do is look at specific elements

00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:01.316 A:middle
of your screen and get their

00:16:01.316 --> 00:16:02.606 A:middle
accessibility information, as

00:16:02.916 --> 00:16:05.496 A:middle
well as run a full audit of the

00:16:05.496 --> 00:16:08.166 A:middle
accessibility in your app.

00:16:09.016 --> 00:16:10.726 A:middle
Now I'm not going to cover using

00:16:10.726 --> 00:16:13.196 A:middle
this tool today, but there was a

00:16:13.196 --> 00:16:15.946 A:middle
session at last year's WWDC that

00:16:15.946 --> 00:16:18.056 A:middle
covered extensively how you take

00:16:18.056 --> 00:16:19.986 A:middle
advantage of this app and work

00:16:19.986 --> 00:16:21.306 A:middle
it into your own workflow.

00:16:21.556 --> 00:16:22.696 A:middle
So, if you're interested in that

00:16:22.736 --> 00:16:24.276 A:middle
I recommend that you check it

00:16:24.276 --> 00:16:24.926 A:middle
out at this link.

00:16:26.836 --> 00:16:28.266 A:middle
Instead, what I like to do now

00:16:28.266 --> 00:16:30.546 A:middle
for you is demo auditing a

00:16:30.546 --> 00:16:31.446 A:middle
sample app that I've been

00:16:31.446 --> 00:16:31.966 A:middle
working on.

00:16:40.046 --> 00:16:41.896 A:middle
So, I'm going to come to my

00:16:41.896 --> 00:16:43.986 A:middle
device here and you can see I

00:16:43.986 --> 00:16:45.326 A:middle
have this app down in the corner

00:16:45.326 --> 00:16:46.226 A:middle
called Pre-Poster.

00:16:47.136 --> 00:16:50.076 A:middle
Now this is an app I've been

00:16:50.076 --> 00:16:51.826 A:middle
working on that allows me to

00:16:51.996 --> 00:16:54.196 A:middle
post posts to a social network

00:16:54.536 --> 00:16:56.206 A:middle
to a close group of friends

00:16:56.446 --> 00:16:58.276 A:middle
before I post it to the wider

00:16:58.276 --> 00:16:59.516 A:middle
social network to make sure I

00:16:59.516 --> 00:17:01.276 A:middle
have all my friends' approval of

00:17:01.276 --> 00:17:02.226 A:middle
those things I'm posting.

00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:06.826 A:middle
Now I have things like up vote

00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:08.126 A:middle
buttons and down vote buttons so

00:17:08.126 --> 00:17:09.166 A:middle
that friends can tell me whether

00:17:09.166 --> 00:17:12.096 A:middle
it's good or not, comments, I

00:17:12.096 --> 00:17:13.996 A:middle
have even star ratings so that I

00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:16.846 A:middle
can rate how good a post is, and

00:17:16.846 --> 00:17:19.766 A:middle
I have settings that allow me to

00:17:20.156 --> 00:17:21.636 A:middle
set which social networks I want

00:17:22.066 --> 00:17:23.696 A:middle
to automatically post to when

00:17:23.696 --> 00:17:24.736 A:middle
the timer runs down.

00:17:25.286 --> 00:17:28.996 A:middle
So, let's turn on VoiceOver and

00:17:28.996 --> 00:17:30.626 A:middle
just see what we find.

00:17:30.806 --> 00:17:32.736 A:middle
I'm going to triple click the

00:17:32.736 --> 00:17:34.206 A:middle
Home button and as you can see,

00:17:34.206 --> 00:17:34.996 A:middle
I have my accessibility

00:17:34.996 --> 00:17:36.456 A:middle
shortcuts to include the

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:38.226 A:middle
VoiceOver and Smart Invert and

00:17:38.226 --> 00:17:39.576 A:middle
I'm going to select VoiceOver.

00:17:40.816 --> 00:17:44.136 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on Pre-Poster Tom

00:17:45.866 --> 00:17:47.666 A:middle
McNeil, [inaudible] button,

00:17:48.386 --> 00:17:52.006 A:middle
three button, button, two open

00:17:52.006 --> 00:17:52.456 A:middle
posts.

00:17:53.886 --> 00:17:55.496 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, I'm swiping my finger

00:17:55.496 --> 00:17:57.436 A:middle
with VoiceOver to navigate

00:17:57.436 --> 00:17:59.536 A:middle
between elements onscreen and I

00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:00.726 A:middle
noticed a couple of things

00:18:00.726 --> 00:18:00.956 A:middle
there.

00:18:01.456 --> 00:18:03.516 A:middle
First of all, elements were out

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:04.066 A:middle
of order.

00:18:04.446 --> 00:18:05.836 A:middle
I swiped from one label to the

00:18:05.836 --> 00:18:07.296 A:middle
buttons to the second label.

00:18:08.386 --> 00:18:09.666 A:middle
Both labels didn't give me any

00:18:09.666 --> 00:18:10.796 A:middle
indication that I can actually

00:18:10.796 --> 00:18:12.746 A:middle
tap on them to go into my own

00:18:12.746 --> 00:18:13.876 A:middle
profile and see all my own

00:18:13.876 --> 00:18:14.416 A:middle
posts.

00:18:14.866 --> 00:18:16.636 A:middle
And all of those buttons were

00:18:16.636 --> 00:18:18.296 A:middle
missing labels to tell me what

00:18:18.296 --> 00:18:19.736 A:middle
they actually do and what

00:18:19.736 --> 00:18:20.606 A:middle
they're meant to be.

00:18:22.046 --> 00:18:22.706 A:middle
So, let's keep going.

00:18:22.886 --> 00:18:25.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Lexi Torres five minutes

00:18:25.746 --> 00:18:28.296 A:middle
remaining, just finished my set

00:18:28.296 --> 00:18:31.106 A:middle
three comments, two button,

00:18:31.606 --> 00:18:32.936 A:middle
three button.

00:18:34.036 --> 00:18:36.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now those two buttons have

00:18:36.406 --> 00:18:38.436 A:middle
their values because I'm storing

00:18:38.436 --> 00:18:39.596 A:middle
the number of votes in the

00:18:39.596 --> 00:18:41.066 A:middle
buttons text label so VoiceOver

00:18:41.066 --> 00:18:42.696 A:middle
is able to read that, but again

00:18:42.696 --> 00:18:43.706 A:middle
they're unlabeled because I have

00:18:43.706 --> 00:18:44.936 A:middle
no idea what those buttons

00:18:44.936 --> 00:18:46.396 A:middle
actually do, what is the three

00:18:46.646 --> 00:18:48.226 A:middle
ore the two associated with.

00:18:48.376 --> 00:18:51.146 A:middle
I'm going to come down here and

00:18:51.576 --> 00:18:54.196 A:middle
I'm going to try and focus on

00:18:54.286 --> 00:18:55.106 A:middle
the star view.

00:18:56.346 --> 00:19:00.266 A:middle
What you're hearing is VoiceOver

00:19:00.266 --> 00:19:02.056 A:middle
indicating to the user that

00:19:02.056 --> 00:19:03.726 A:middle
there's no accessible element

00:19:03.726 --> 00:19:04.706 A:middle
underneath my finger.

00:19:05.286 --> 00:19:08.916 A:middle
And that means that the star

00:19:08.916 --> 00:19:11.466 A:middle
view is not accessible at all so

00:19:11.466 --> 00:19:13.956 A:middle
we're going to need to fix that.

00:19:14.096 --> 00:19:14.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Button.

00:19:14.766 --> 00:19:15.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's check out the settings

00:19:16.516 --> 00:19:16.756 A:middle
page.

00:19:18.106 --> 00:19:20.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Settings close button.

00:19:21.216 --> 00:19:22.526 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That seems to be labeled

00:19:22.806 --> 00:19:23.326 A:middle
properly.

00:19:23.326 --> 00:19:26.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Facebook, Facebook.

00:19:26.036 --> 00:19:28.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, two things I notice here.

00:19:29.396 --> 00:19:31.436 A:middle
First of all, the cell isn't

00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:33.276 A:middle
indicating to me whether or not

00:19:33.276 --> 00:19:34.576 A:middle
the setting is actually enabled.

00:19:34.776 --> 00:19:36.066 A:middle
And secondly, when I did a

00:19:36.066 --> 00:19:37.886 A:middle
double tap to activate it I

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:39.486 A:middle
would expect it to enable or

00:19:39.486 --> 00:19:41.446 A:middle
disable the setting and that

00:19:41.446 --> 00:19:42.286 A:middle
didn't happen either.

00:19:44.056 --> 00:19:44.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Close.

00:19:44.826 --> 00:19:46.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now one other thing I

00:19:46.356 --> 00:19:46.626 A:middle
noticed.

00:19:46.626 --> 00:19:47.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Tom McNeil.

00:19:48.526 --> 00:19:50.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Is that when I was swiping

00:19:50.746 --> 00:19:53.036 A:middle
through items on my post it gave

00:19:53.036 --> 00:19:54.916 A:middle
me no indication that I can

00:19:54.916 --> 00:19:56.146 A:middle
actually delete the post.

00:19:56.626 --> 00:19:59.096 A:middle
When I'm not using VoiceOver if

00:19:59.096 --> 00:20:00.506 A:middle
I do a long press on one of

00:20:00.506 --> 00:20:02.296 A:middle
these cells it brings up an

00:20:02.296 --> 00:20:03.776 A:middle
action sheet to initiate a

00:20:03.776 --> 00:20:03.976 A:middle
delete.

00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:08.346 A:middle
But that interaction isn't clear

00:20:08.346 --> 00:20:09.936 A:middle
to a VoiceOver user at all and

00:20:09.936 --> 00:20:12.376 A:middle
they have no way of initiating

00:20:13.696 --> 00:20:14.006 A:middle
it.

00:20:14.206 --> 00:20:15.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Alert accessibility short

00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:16.936 A:middle
VoiceOver off.

00:20:17.666 --> 00:20:19.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, let's take a look at some

00:20:19.406 --> 00:20:21.226 A:middle
of the basics of our API to

00:20:21.226 --> 00:20:22.236 A:middle
solve these problems.

00:20:22.776 --> 00:20:25.296 A:middle
Just to recap, this is what we

00:20:25.296 --> 00:20:25.646 A:middle
found.

00:20:26.486 --> 00:20:28.926 A:middle
First, we had elements that were

00:20:28.926 --> 00:20:30.816 A:middle
out of order and my profile

00:20:30.816 --> 00:20:32.306 A:middle
elements didn't indicate that I

00:20:32.306 --> 00:20:34.166 A:middle
could tap on them to get to my

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:35.626 A:middle
own profile so it really makes

00:20:35.626 --> 00:20:37.546 A:middle
sense to group them together as

00:20:37.546 --> 00:20:40.536 A:middle
a single element that acts as a

00:20:40.726 --> 00:20:40.876 A:middle
button.

00:20:41.246 --> 00:20:43.766 A:middle
Next, I have unlabeled buttons

00:20:43.896 --> 00:20:47.346 A:middle
on the top, as well as these on

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:47.726 A:middle
the cell.

00:20:50.836 --> 00:20:52.836 A:middle
The star view was entirely

00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:57.686 A:middle
inaccessible, as was initiating

00:20:57.686 --> 00:20:58.846 A:middle
a delete of a post.

00:21:00.306 --> 00:21:03.616 A:middle
And finally, the settings didn't

00:21:03.616 --> 00:21:04.576 A:middle
tell me whether or not they were

00:21:04.576 --> 00:21:07.956 A:middle
enabled and an activate of them

00:21:07.996 --> 00:21:09.216 A:middle
didn't actually change the

00:21:10.416 --> 00:21:11.006 A:middle
value.

00:21:13.436 --> 00:21:14.316 A:middle
So, how do we solve them?

00:21:15.876 --> 00:21:17.916 A:middle
Well when a technology like

00:21:17.916 --> 00:21:20.196 A:middle
VoiceOver is trying to get

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:21.876 A:middle
information about an element for

00:21:21.876 --> 00:21:23.186 A:middle
an app, so when a VoiceOver user

00:21:23.346 --> 00:21:24.506 A:middle
focuses on an element on the

00:21:24.506 --> 00:21:26.446 A:middle
screen it's going to ask a

00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:27.686 A:middle
couple of questions.

00:21:28.666 --> 00:21:31.126 A:middle
Questions like what are you, I'm

00:21:32.336 --> 00:21:33.606 A:middle
a button?

00:21:35.396 --> 00:21:39.786 A:middle
Who are you, I'm a Notifications

00:21:39.786 --> 00:21:40.126 A:middle
button?

00:21:41.566 --> 00:21:47.136 A:middle
What's your value, three unread

00:21:47.136 --> 00:21:47.946 A:middle
notifications?

00:21:48.946 --> 00:21:50.926 A:middle
Now all of these questions and

00:21:50.926 --> 00:21:53.586 A:middle
answers correspond to properties

00:21:53.586 --> 00:21:55.436 A:middle
in code and return specific

00:21:55.436 --> 00:21:56.576 A:middle
kinds of return values.

00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:59.736 A:middle
So, let's take a look at this.

00:22:00.316 --> 00:22:02.636 A:middle
Here we have the five basic

00:22:02.636 --> 00:22:04.666 A:middle
properties in the accessibility

00:22:04.846 --> 00:22:06.476 A:middle
protocol and we're going to go

00:22:06.476 --> 00:22:07.566 A:middle
through them one by one looking

00:22:07.566 --> 00:22:08.266 A:middle
at an example.

00:22:09.156 --> 00:22:11.016 A:middle
So, the first

00:22:11.126 --> 00:22:13.696 A:middle
isAccessibilityElement indicates

00:22:13.996 --> 00:22:15.866 A:middle
to a technology like VoiceOver

00:22:15.866 --> 00:22:17.596 A:middle
or Switch Control whether the

00:22:17.596 --> 00:22:18.856 A:middle
given element should be visible

00:22:18.856 --> 00:22:19.756 A:middle
to VoiceOver at all.

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:23.086 A:middle
So, if we're looking at the

00:22:23.086 --> 00:22:26.536 A:middle
memory view up in the corner

00:22:26.536 --> 00:22:28.706 A:middle
there that has a slideshow of

00:22:28.706 --> 00:22:30.846 A:middle
images within the memory, a

00:22:30.846 --> 00:22:32.456 A:middle
label with the title, as well as

00:22:32.456 --> 00:22:34.066 A:middle
a play button that's a great

00:22:34.066 --> 00:22:36.996 A:middle
candidate for making a button,

00:22:37.186 --> 00:22:38.586 A:middle
the overall element a button

00:22:38.586 --> 00:22:41.356 A:middle
that when I tap on plays the

00:22:41.356 --> 00:22:41.786 A:middle
movie.

00:22:42.446 --> 00:22:44.626 A:middle
So, I'm going to set

00:22:44.906 --> 00:22:46.206 A:middle
isAccessibilityElement to be

00:22:46.206 --> 00:22:48.056 A:middle
true on that memory view.

00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:51.406 A:middle
But now because of the way that

00:22:51.406 --> 00:22:53.226 A:middle
I've coded this it's possible

00:22:53.226 --> 00:22:54.626 A:middle
that this play button is still

00:22:54.626 --> 00:22:56.316 A:middle
going to come up as an

00:22:56.396 --> 00:22:58.216 A:middle
accessible element to VoiceOver

00:22:58.526 --> 00:23:00.126 A:middle
and because I'm making that

00:23:00.126 --> 00:23:02.406 A:middle
overall element the target

00:23:02.406 --> 00:23:05.356 A:middle
instead then I want to set this

00:23:05.356 --> 00:23:06.616 A:middle
play button's is excessively

00:23:06.616 --> 00:23:08.186 A:middle
element to be false so that it

00:23:08.186 --> 00:23:09.976 A:middle
doesn't come up and we don't

00:23:09.976 --> 00:23:10.896 A:middle
have redundancy there.

00:23:11.956 --> 00:23:14.546 A:middle
And one thing that I forgot to

00:23:14.546 --> 00:23:18.216 A:middle
mention is that it's a good idea

00:23:18.216 --> 00:23:20.696 A:middle
to make the big area the play

00:23:20.696 --> 00:23:22.676 A:middle
button instead because if I'm a

00:23:22.676 --> 00:23:24.956 A:middle
VoiceOver user navigating around

00:23:25.316 --> 00:23:27.136 A:middle
this UI with by just feeling my

00:23:27.136 --> 00:23:29.096 A:middle
finger around the screen it's

00:23:29.096 --> 00:23:31.016 A:middle
much harder to find that tiny

00:23:31.016 --> 00:23:32.516 A:middle
play button to play the movie

00:23:32.516 --> 00:23:33.796 A:middle
than it is to find that big

00:23:33.846 --> 00:23:34.136 A:middle
area.

00:23:34.626 --> 00:23:39.986 A:middle
Next, we have accessibilityLabel

00:23:40.636 --> 00:23:42.326 A:middle
which describes what an element

00:23:42.356 --> 00:23:42.846 A:middle
is.

00:23:43.656 --> 00:23:45.096 A:middle
So, for example with our memory

00:23:45.096 --> 00:23:47.716 A:middle
view it's a memory and its title

00:23:47.886 --> 00:23:49.866 A:middle
is February 18th, 2017.

00:23:49.866 --> 00:23:51.516 A:middle
So, that seems like a reasonable

00:23:51.806 --> 00:23:52.146 A:middle
label.

00:23:52.746 --> 00:23:54.826 A:middle
But now because we're going to

00:23:54.826 --> 00:23:56.976 A:middle
be treating it like a button you

00:23:56.976 --> 00:23:59.206 A:middle
might wonder why we don't add

00:23:59.356 --> 00:24:01.006 A:middle
the word button into our label

00:24:01.406 --> 00:24:02.876 A:middle
and that's because of this next

00:24:02.876 --> 00:24:05.466 A:middle
property, accessibilityTraits.

00:24:06.146 --> 00:24:08.306 A:middle
This indicates to VoiceOver what

00:24:08.356 --> 00:24:10.406 A:middle
category an element fits into.

00:24:11.086 --> 00:24:13.066 A:middle
So, for example we're going to

00:24:13.066 --> 00:24:14.176 A:middle
set our memory view

00:24:14.176 --> 00:24:15.776 A:middle
accessibilityTraits to include

00:24:15.966 --> 00:24:17.136 A:middle
the button trait so that

00:24:17.136 --> 00:24:18.496 A:middle
VoiceOver knows to treat it like

00:24:18.496 --> 00:24:18.946 A:middle
a button.

00:24:19.736 --> 00:24:20.836 A:middle
This also means that when it

00:24:20.836 --> 00:24:22.056 A:middle
reads the description for the

00:24:22.056 --> 00:24:24.546 A:middle
item it's going to say button at

00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:25.906 A:middle
the end of that so that the user

00:24:25.906 --> 00:24:26.836 A:middle
knows what it is.

00:24:27.226 --> 00:24:29.656 A:middle
Now traits are also important

00:24:29.656 --> 00:24:30.596 A:middle
for two more reasons.

00:24:31.176 --> 00:24:32.966 A:middle
One, they can afford certain UI

00:24:32.966 --> 00:24:34.676 A:middle
behaviors which you'll see you

00:24:34.676 --> 00:24:35.876 A:middle
later in the presentation.

00:24:36.506 --> 00:24:39.506 A:middle
And two, there's mechanisms for

00:24:39.506 --> 00:24:42.126 A:middle
users to navigate the interface

00:24:42.186 --> 00:24:44.176 A:middle
based on specific kinds of items

00:24:44.176 --> 00:24:45.766 A:middle
that will be surfaced based on

00:24:45.766 --> 00:24:49.186 A:middle
what traits are associated with

00:24:49.826 --> 00:24:49.906 A:middle
it.

00:24:50.166 --> 00:24:52.586 A:middle
Next, we have accessibilityValue

00:24:53.146 --> 00:24:55.206 A:middle
which is for elements that have

00:24:55.206 --> 00:24:56.236 A:middle
some form of state.

00:24:56.986 --> 00:25:00.296 A:middle
So, for instance if we're in our

00:25:00.296 --> 00:25:01.996 A:middle
memory video and we're editing

00:25:02.346 --> 00:25:03.476 A:middle
there's a scrubber along the

00:25:03.476 --> 00:25:05.596 A:middle
bottom that allows me to scrub

00:25:05.596 --> 00:25:06.726 A:middle
through the whole video.

00:25:07.646 --> 00:25:09.626 A:middle
And the current valve of that

00:25:09.626 --> 00:25:12.696 A:middle
item is the second that I'm

00:25:12.696 --> 00:25:14.186 A:middle
focused on of the elapsed

00:25:14.186 --> 00:25:15.196 A:middle
seconds that have already

00:25:15.196 --> 00:25:15.666 A:middle
happened.

00:25:16.246 --> 00:25:17.586 A:middle
So, I can set its accessibility

00:25:17.586 --> 00:25:19.996 A:middle
value to be that elapsed number

00:25:19.996 --> 00:25:21.056 A:middle
of seconds that I'm currently

00:25:21.056 --> 00:25:23.126 A:middle
looking at.

00:25:23.556 --> 00:25:25.176 A:middle
Finally, we have

00:25:25.176 --> 00:25:26.896 A:middle
accessibilityHint.

00:25:27.756 --> 00:25:29.256 A:middle
Now this is meant to be a more

00:25:29.256 --> 00:25:31.446 A:middle
longform description of how to

00:25:31.446 --> 00:25:33.026 A:middle
interact with an element, what

00:25:33.026 --> 00:25:35.186 A:middle
it does or what it's meant for.

00:25:36.136 --> 00:25:39.266 A:middle
You can think of this as being a

00:25:39.266 --> 00:25:41.186 A:middle
property that allows you to

00:25:41.186 --> 00:25:42.936 A:middle
describe to a user that's new to

00:25:42.936 --> 00:25:45.056 A:middle
your interface and help them

00:25:45.056 --> 00:25:47.266 A:middle
learn how to use your interface.

00:25:47.746 --> 00:25:49.556 A:middle
But it's important that you

00:25:49.556 --> 00:25:52.316 A:middle
never put critical information

00:25:52.316 --> 00:25:55.506 A:middle
to whoever's using it in a hint

00:25:55.616 --> 00:25:56.856 A:middle
because hints can actually be

00:25:56.856 --> 00:25:58.806 A:middle
disabled to keep VoiceOver from

00:25:58.806 --> 00:26:00.166 A:middle
being too verbose for

00:26:00.166 --> 00:26:00.976 A:middle
experienced users.

00:26:08.116 --> 00:26:09.166 A:middle
So, going a little further.

00:26:09.896 --> 00:26:12.056 A:middle
New this year we have attributed

00:26:12.056 --> 00:26:14.596 A:middle
versions of label, value and

00:26:14.596 --> 00:26:14.876 A:middle
hint.

00:26:15.586 --> 00:26:17.456 A:middle
And what these allow you to do

00:26:17.456 --> 00:26:19.766 A:middle
is pass through specific keys to

00:26:19.766 --> 00:26:21.686 A:middle
tweak the way in which VoiceOver

00:26:21.876 --> 00:26:22.926 A:middle
speaks a string.

00:26:23.816 --> 00:26:25.936 A:middle
So, for example if I have a

00:26:25.936 --> 00:26:27.606 A:middle
string that I know I want to

00:26:27.606 --> 00:26:28.666 A:middle
speak -- that's in a different

00:26:28.666 --> 00:26:30.196 A:middle
language and should be spoken

00:26:30.716 --> 00:26:31.916 A:middle
with a different voice

00:26:31.916 --> 00:26:33.416 A:middle
synthesizer specific to that

00:26:33.416 --> 00:26:35.546 A:middle
language then I can use the

00:26:35.546 --> 00:26:37.036 A:middle
UIAccessibilitySpeech

00:26:37.076 --> 00:26:39.746 A:middle
AttributeLanguage key and pass

00:26:39.746 --> 00:26:41.846 A:middle
in the correct language code so

00:26:41.846 --> 00:26:43.376 A:middle
that when VoiceOver speaks it,

00:26:43.736 --> 00:26:45.556 A:middle
it speaks it with say in this

00:26:45.556 --> 00:26:47.116 A:middle
example, the French synthesizer.

00:26:49.516 --> 00:26:51.586 A:middle
Now as well let's say I had an

00:26:51.586 --> 00:26:54.736 A:middle
announcement that I wanted to

00:26:54.736 --> 00:26:57.106 A:middle
post and speak, but I felt like

00:26:57.106 --> 00:26:58.836 A:middle
that announcement isn't

00:26:58.836 --> 00:27:00.356 A:middle
important enough to interrupt

00:27:00.356 --> 00:27:01.436 A:middle
whatever current speech is

00:27:01.436 --> 00:27:01.976 A:middle
happening.

00:27:02.596 --> 00:27:03.866 A:middle
Well in this case I can use an

00:27:03.866 --> 00:27:05.526 A:middle
attributed string with the

00:27:05.526 --> 00:27:07.026 A:middle
UIAccessibilitySpeech

00:27:07.086 --> 00:27:09.276 A:middle
AttributeQueueAnnouncement that

00:27:09.276 --> 00:27:10.886 A:middle
will queue the speech behind

00:27:10.886 --> 00:27:12.026 A:middle
whatever existing speech is

00:27:12.026 --> 00:27:14.166 A:middle
already there so that it will be

00:27:14.166 --> 00:27:16.096 A:middle
spoken whatever VoiceOver was

00:27:16.096 --> 00:27:19.136 A:middle
already speaking is done.

00:27:20.036 --> 00:27:22.046 A:middle
Also, new this year we have the

00:27:22.046 --> 00:27:24.026 A:middle
concept of containers.

00:27:24.516 --> 00:27:26.406 A:middle
So previously, when a VoiceOver

00:27:26.406 --> 00:27:28.806 A:middle
user would swipe into a

00:27:28.806 --> 00:27:30.976 A:middle
container of some kind they

00:27:30.976 --> 00:27:31.626 A:middle
wouldn't really get an

00:27:31.626 --> 00:27:34.006 A:middle
indication of what kind of thing

00:27:34.006 --> 00:27:34.966 A:middle
they were swiping into, what

00:27:34.966 --> 00:27:36.516 A:middle
does those content actually even

00:27:36.516 --> 00:27:36.796 A:middle
mean.

00:27:38.066 --> 00:27:38.966 A:middle
So, we're introducing

00:27:38.966 --> 00:27:41.046 A:middle
accessibilityContainerType where

00:27:41.046 --> 00:27:43.036 A:middle
you can define this and there

00:27:43.036 --> 00:27:44.506 A:middle
are several different kinds of

00:27:44.506 --> 00:27:45.316 A:middle
containers.

00:27:46.356 --> 00:27:48.016 A:middle
The biggest one there is

00:27:48.016 --> 00:27:49.816 A:middle
dataTable which actually

00:27:49.816 --> 00:27:51.286 A:middle
requires conformance to the UI

00:27:51.286 --> 00:27:52.576 A:middle
accessibility container

00:27:52.576 --> 00:27:56.346 A:middle
dataTable protocol and improves

00:27:56.346 --> 00:27:57.756 A:middle
the way in which a VoiceOver

00:27:57.756 --> 00:27:59.126 A:middle
user can navigate through your

00:27:59.126 --> 00:28:00.726 A:middle
dataTable and understand where

00:28:02.656 --> 00:28:02.966 A:middle
they are.

00:28:03.956 --> 00:28:04.966 A:middle
So, everything that I just

00:28:04.996 --> 00:28:08.236 A:middle
covered there applies to views

00:28:08.236 --> 00:28:09.926 A:middle
that you would use through UIKit

00:28:10.346 --> 00:28:10.413 A:middle
you.

00:28:10.696 --> 00:28:14.806 A:middle
But what if your controls exist

00:28:14.806 --> 00:28:16.736 A:middle
out of UIKit, you have some sort

00:28:16.736 --> 00:28:19.026 A:middle
of non-view element that perhaps

00:28:19.026 --> 00:28:20.306 A:middle
you've drawn using core

00:28:20.306 --> 00:28:21.046 A:middle
graphics.

00:28:21.736 --> 00:28:23.346 A:middle
Well in that case we still need

00:28:23.346 --> 00:28:25.656 A:middle
to surface those controls to

00:28:25.656 --> 00:28:29.746 A:middle
VoiceOver and so we're going to

00:28:29.746 --> 00:28:33.466 A:middle
use UI accessibilityElement to

00:28:33.466 --> 00:28:35.766 A:middle
represent logical accessible

00:28:35.766 --> 00:28:37.006 A:middle
regions of the screen to

00:28:37.006 --> 00:28:39.006 A:middle
basically stand in for those

00:28:39.006 --> 00:28:39.626 A:middle
controls.

00:28:40.196 --> 00:28:42.656 A:middle
So, UI accessibilityElement you

00:28:42.656 --> 00:28:44.696 A:middle
set all the properties that I

00:28:44.696 --> 00:28:46.556 A:middle
covered before on it like you

00:28:46.556 --> 00:28:48.716 A:middle
would on any other view and it's

00:28:48.716 --> 00:28:49.666 A:middle
initialized with an

00:28:49.666 --> 00:28:51.466 A:middle
accessibility container that

00:28:51.466 --> 00:28:52.376 A:middle
would be the view that it's

00:28:52.406 --> 00:28:53.186 A:middle
contained in.

00:28:54.406 --> 00:28:56.516 A:middle
And then you override on the

00:28:56.616 --> 00:28:57.446 A:middle
container the

00:28:57.446 --> 00:28:59.266 A:middle
accessibilityElements protocol

00:28:59.986 --> 00:29:03.856 A:middle
which tells VoiceOver what sub

00:29:03.856 --> 00:29:06.516 A:middle
elements within a view are the

00:29:06.516 --> 00:29:07.566 A:middle
accessible elements.

00:29:08.316 --> 00:29:10.756 A:middle
And the order in which elements

00:29:10.756 --> 00:29:12.716 A:middle
are returned in this array is

00:29:12.716 --> 00:29:15.336 A:middle
the order in which VoiceOver

00:29:15.336 --> 00:29:16.196 A:middle
will swipe through them.

00:29:17.066 --> 00:29:19.906 A:middle
So that seems like a great

00:29:19.956 --> 00:29:22.876 A:middle
candidate for combining those

00:29:23.406 --> 00:29:24.966 A:middle
profile elements into a single

00:29:24.966 --> 00:29:25.386 A:middle
element.

00:29:26.916 --> 00:29:28.576 A:middle
So, let's come back over to our

00:29:28.576 --> 00:29:31.206 A:middle
sample app and take a look at

00:29:31.206 --> 00:29:32.006 A:middle
implementing some of these

00:29:32.006 --> 00:29:32.496 A:middle
basics.

00:29:42.246 --> 00:29:45.106 A:middle
Okay, so I have -- I'm in my

00:29:45.106 --> 00:29:46.206 A:middle
home view controller which is

00:29:46.206 --> 00:29:47.666 A:middle
the main screen I'm on and the

00:29:47.666 --> 00:29:49.706 A:middle
first I want to do is fix the

00:29:49.706 --> 00:29:52.326 A:middle
labels for those buttons that

00:29:52.326 --> 00:29:52.976 A:middle
are up on the top.

00:29:59.046 --> 00:30:00.866 A:middle
So, for the add button I'm going

00:30:00.866 --> 00:30:02.216 A:middle
to say new post because it

00:30:02.216 --> 00:30:03.196 A:middle
creates a new post.

00:30:03.856 --> 00:30:04.996 A:middle
The notifications button I'm

00:30:04.996 --> 00:30:05.856 A:middle
going to set its label to be

00:30:05.856 --> 00:30:08.506 A:middle
notifications and its value to

00:30:08.506 --> 00:30:10.266 A:middle
be my current number of unread

00:30:10.266 --> 00:30:11.286 A:middle
notifications.

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:13.186 A:middle
And then the settings button I'm

00:30:13.186 --> 00:30:13.976 A:middle
going to set to be settings.

00:30:19.046 --> 00:30:19.926 A:middle
Now I'm going to go take care of

00:30:19.926 --> 00:30:21.676 A:middle
those other unlabeled buttons

00:30:21.976 --> 00:30:24.736 A:middle
that were my upload and download

00:30:26.426 --> 00:30:26.926 A:middle
buttons.

00:30:27.536 --> 00:30:31.276 A:middle
So, for my approved button I'm

00:30:31.276 --> 00:30:32.586 A:middle
going to set its label to be up

00:30:32.586 --> 00:30:34.256 A:middle
vote and for my disapprove

00:30:34.256 --> 00:30:35.436 A:middle
button down vote.

00:30:36.506 --> 00:30:38.216 A:middle
Now I need to also remember to

00:30:38.216 --> 00:30:40.176 A:middle
change the accessibility value

00:30:40.176 --> 00:30:42.236 A:middle
of these buttons whenever my

00:30:42.236 --> 00:30:43.556 A:middle
number of approves or number of

00:30:43.556 --> 00:30:44.766 A:middle
disapproves changes.

00:30:45.146 --> 00:30:46.376 A:middle
So, when I come into here I'm

00:30:46.536 --> 00:30:51.076 A:middle
going to make a switch statement

00:30:51.256 --> 00:30:52.616 A:middle
based on number of approves.

00:30:52.816 --> 00:30:54.536 A:middle
When it's one I'm going to say

00:30:54.676 --> 00:30:56.046 A:middle
it's the number of approves vote

00:30:56.656 --> 00:30:58.006 A:middle
or when it's more than one I'm

00:30:58.006 --> 00:30:59.086 A:middle
going to day number of approves

00:30:59.086 --> 00:30:59.496 A:middle
votes.

00:30:59.886 --> 00:31:01.876 A:middle
And I'm going to do the same

00:31:01.876 --> 00:31:02.276 A:middle
thing.

00:31:08.596 --> 00:31:09.386 A:middle
For the disapprove.

00:31:10.716 --> 00:31:13.696 A:middle
So, let's go to the star view

00:31:14.986 --> 00:31:16.306 A:middle
which was previously

00:31:16.306 --> 00:31:18.606 A:middle
inaccessible and we're going to

00:31:18.606 --> 00:31:20.826 A:middle
make that an accessible element.

00:31:26.046 --> 00:31:26.766 A:middle
The first thing that we're going

00:31:26.766 --> 00:31:27.706 A:middle
to do is override

00:31:27.706 --> 00:31:29.576 A:middle
isAccessibilityElement to return

00:31:29.576 --> 00:31:31.296 A:middle
true so that VoiceOver knows

00:31:31.296 --> 00:31:32.266 A:middle
that this is an element it

00:31:32.266 --> 00:31:33.016 A:middle
should focus on.

00:31:33.246 --> 00:31:35.446 A:middle
Going to set its label to be

00:31:35.446 --> 00:31:37.196 A:middle
star rating because that's what

00:31:37.196 --> 00:31:37.546 A:middle
it is.

00:31:38.186 --> 00:31:40.816 A:middle
And then for its value based on

00:31:40.816 --> 00:31:41.886 A:middle
the number of stars we're going

00:31:41.886 --> 00:31:44.326 A:middle
to return either no rating, one

00:31:44.326 --> 00:31:47.646 A:middle
star or the current number of

00:31:48.536 --> 00:31:48.696 A:middle
stars.

00:31:50.166 --> 00:31:53.806 A:middle
So now let's come back to the

00:31:53.806 --> 00:31:55.656 A:middle
home view controller where we

00:31:55.656 --> 00:31:56.976 A:middle
had those labels that we wanted

00:31:56.976 --> 00:31:59.806 A:middle
to join together to be a single

00:31:59.806 --> 00:32:01.116 A:middle
element that acted like a

00:32:01.116 --> 00:32:01.766 A:middle
button.

00:32:02.876 --> 00:32:04.466 A:middle
So, what we're going to do for

00:32:04.466 --> 00:32:06.996 A:middle
that is a couple things.

00:32:07.666 --> 00:32:09.026 A:middle
We're going to create a UI

00:32:09.026 --> 00:32:10.796 A:middle
accessibilityElement the

00:32:10.796 --> 00:32:12.146 A:middle
container of which is the header

00:32:12.146 --> 00:32:14.496 A:middle
view and then we're going to set

00:32:14.496 --> 00:32:16.566 A:middle
its label to be my profile name,

00:32:17.006 --> 00:32:18.266 A:middle
its value to be my number of

00:32:18.266 --> 00:32:20.746 A:middle
open posts, and its traits to

00:32:20.746 --> 00:32:22.186 A:middle
include the button traits so the

00:32:22.186 --> 00:32:23.366 A:middle
user knows that they can

00:32:23.366 --> 00:32:24.376 A:middle
interact with it like a button.

00:32:25.216 --> 00:32:28.296 A:middle
And then I'm going to find its

00:32:28.296 --> 00:32:30.696 A:middle
frame and set this property

00:32:31.046 --> 00:32:32.166 A:middle
accessibilityFrame

00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:33.236 A:middle
InContainerSpace.

00:32:33.556 --> 00:32:36.076 A:middle
Now this is important because

00:32:36.576 --> 00:32:37.396 A:middle
for a couple reasons.

00:32:37.466 --> 00:32:39.986 A:middle
It's telling VoiceOver where the

00:32:39.986 --> 00:32:42.126 A:middle
element is onscreen and the

00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:43.336 A:middle
coordinate space of its

00:32:43.336 --> 00:32:45.966 A:middle
container which is used to draw

00:32:45.966 --> 00:32:47.736 A:middle
the bounding box, as well as

00:32:47.736 --> 00:32:50.246 A:middle
when a VoiceOver user is feeling

00:32:50.246 --> 00:32:51.576 A:middle
around the screen for elements

00:32:52.106 --> 00:32:53.286 A:middle
it's using this property to

00:32:53.286 --> 00:32:54.866 A:middle
detect whether or not an element

00:32:54.866 --> 00:32:56.196 A:middle
can be found underneath their

00:32:56.196 --> 00:32:56.486 A:middle
finger.

00:32:57.676 --> 00:33:00.286 A:middle
Finally, on our header view,

00:33:00.876 --> 00:33:01.706 A:middle
we're going to set our

00:33:01.706 --> 00:33:03.226 A:middle
accessibilityElements to contain

00:33:03.266 --> 00:33:05.846 A:middle
our new element plus those three

00:33:05.846 --> 00:33:08.026 A:middle
buttons that we had already.

00:33:08.556 --> 00:33:13.306 A:middle
Last but not least, I want to

00:33:13.306 --> 00:33:19.036 A:middle
come to the switch cell and make

00:33:19.076 --> 00:33:20.406 A:middle
this the whole cell an

00:33:20.406 --> 00:33:22.276 A:middle
accessibility element and for

00:33:22.276 --> 00:33:24.206 A:middle
its value based on whether or

00:33:24.206 --> 00:33:25.736 A:middle
not the switch is currently on

00:33:25.806 --> 00:33:28.356 A:middle
I'm going to say on or off as

00:33:28.356 --> 00:33:29.356 A:middle
its accessibility value.

00:33:29.946 --> 00:33:32.246 A:middle
So, let me build that to my

00:33:32.246 --> 00:33:32.656 A:middle
device.

00:33:44.046 --> 00:33:46.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on mail, no unread

00:33:46.106 --> 00:33:46.536 A:middle
emails.

00:33:47.816 --> 00:33:48.976 A:middle
Double tap to open.

00:33:55.046 --> 00:33:56.586 A:middle
Sorry, give me one sec.

00:33:56.746 --> 00:33:59.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Alert, selected.

00:34:05.056 --> 00:34:08.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay well I have thankfully a

00:34:08.476 --> 00:34:09.756 A:middle
premade version of this that

00:34:09.756 --> 00:34:10.796 A:middle
actually already has the

00:34:10.796 --> 00:34:11.786 A:middle
accessibility in it so we're

00:34:12.556 --> 00:34:14.156 A:middle
going to launch that and I'm

00:34:14.186 --> 00:34:15.366 A:middle
going to turn on VoiceOver.

00:34:15.986 --> 00:34:18.286 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on Pre-Poster EX

00:34:18.936 --> 00:34:21.376 A:middle
Tom McNeil two open posts

00:34:21.686 --> 00:34:22.136 A:middle
button.

00:34:22.296 --> 00:34:23.426 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And the first thing that you

00:34:23.426 --> 00:34:24.756 A:middle
see is that I have joined those

00:34:24.756 --> 00:34:26.276 A:middle
elements together and that it's

00:34:26.276 --> 00:34:27.366 A:middle
spoken that it's a button.

00:34:28.156 --> 00:34:30.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Tap the add button,

00:34:31.066 --> 00:34:33.976 A:middle
notifications three, button

00:34:34.436 --> 00:34:35.956 A:middle
settings button.

00:34:36.446 --> 00:34:37.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All those buttons have proper

00:34:37.716 --> 00:34:38.306 A:middle
labels.

00:34:39.116 --> 00:34:42.606 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Down vote two button, up vote

00:34:43.066 --> 00:34:44.356 A:middle
three button.

00:34:45.976 --> 00:34:47.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Those have proper labels as

00:34:47.416 --> 00:34:47.716 A:middle
well.

00:34:49.026 --> 00:34:51.146 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Page two of four star rating,

00:34:51.476 --> 00:34:53.166 A:middle
no rating, adjustable.

00:34:54.016 --> 00:34:56.546 A:middle
I can focus on the star, sorry.

00:34:56.856 --> 00:34:59.206 A:middle
I can focus on the star rating

00:34:59.446 --> 00:35:00.746 A:middle
view, it's actually a view now.

00:35:01.276 --> 00:35:02.606 A:middle
If I go into my settings.

00:35:02.766 --> 00:35:06.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Settings, setting, Facebook

00:35:06.596 --> 00:35:06.926 A:middle
off.

00:35:07.866 --> 00:35:09.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm finally actually reading

00:35:09.406 --> 00:35:10.666 A:middle
whether or not my setting is

00:35:10.666 --> 00:35:12.816 A:middle
currently off or on.

00:35:15.206 --> 00:35:16.866 A:middle
Now there are a couple of

00:35:16.866 --> 00:35:18.566 A:middle
problems that we found during

00:35:18.566 --> 00:35:20.626 A:middle
our audit that we still haven't

00:35:20.626 --> 00:35:21.646 A:middle
actually fixed.

00:35:22.026 --> 00:35:23.616 A:middle
I still have no way of bringing

00:35:23.616 --> 00:35:24.536 A:middle
up the delete sheet.

00:35:24.966 --> 00:35:28.326 A:middle
I have no way of actually

00:35:28.326 --> 00:35:30.556 A:middle
changing the value of the star

00:35:30.556 --> 00:35:31.456 A:middle
rating view.

00:35:31.536 --> 00:35:34.046 A:middle
I can see what it is, I can see

00:35:34.046 --> 00:35:36.186 A:middle
what the current number stars

00:35:36.186 --> 00:35:36.976 A:middle
is, but I have no way of

00:35:36.976 --> 00:35:37.596 A:middle
changing it.

00:35:38.506 --> 00:35:40.046 A:middle
And when I double tap on my

00:35:40.046 --> 00:35:41.166 A:middle
setting it's still not changing

00:35:41.166 --> 00:35:41.926 A:middle
that setting value.

00:35:43.266 --> 00:35:45.746 A:middle
So, the first thing I want to

00:35:45.746 --> 00:35:47.886 A:middle
look at are custom actions.

00:35:48.766 --> 00:35:52.146 A:middle
So, we're going to use these to

00:35:52.146 --> 00:35:53.666 A:middle
bring up that delete sheet in

00:35:53.666 --> 00:35:54.346 A:middle
our sample app.

00:35:54.996 --> 00:35:57.126 A:middle
Basically, a custom action is

00:35:57.126 --> 00:35:58.996 A:middle
something that you add to an

00:35:58.996 --> 00:36:01.316 A:middle
element that is an action that

00:36:01.316 --> 00:36:04.286 A:middle
it has available to it.

00:36:04.286 --> 00:36:07.866 A:middle
So, views have the property

00:36:07.866 --> 00:36:09.846 A:middle
accessibilityCustomActions which

00:36:09.846 --> 00:36:11.646 A:middle
you can override with an array

00:36:12.036 --> 00:36:13.826 A:middle
of UI accessibilityCustomAction

00:36:14.336 --> 00:36:16.236 A:middle
that are all of the actions

00:36:16.236 --> 00:36:16.866 A:middle
available to it.

00:36:17.426 --> 00:36:18.376 A:middle
So, what does an action look

00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:18.576 A:middle
like?

00:36:19.426 --> 00:36:21.876 A:middle
Well it has a name for instance,

00:36:21.876 --> 00:36:23.266 A:middle
our delete action is called

00:36:23.266 --> 00:36:24.986 A:middle
delete because it tells the user

00:36:24.986 --> 00:36:27.686 A:middle
what it does and it has a target

00:36:27.686 --> 00:36:29.096 A:middle
and a selector that get called

00:36:29.146 --> 00:36:30.076 A:middle
whenever that action is

00:36:30.076 --> 00:36:30.696 A:middle
initiated.

00:36:32.106 --> 00:36:36.346 A:middle
So, when a view has custom

00:36:36.346 --> 00:36:38.606 A:middle
actions it's going to tell that

00:36:38.606 --> 00:36:41.176 A:middle
to the user and then the user

00:36:41.176 --> 00:36:42.606 A:middle
can swipe up or down with their

00:36:42.606 --> 00:36:44.836 A:middle
finger to cycle through the

00:36:44.836 --> 00:36:46.616 A:middle
current actions of that element.

00:36:46.996 --> 00:36:48.016 A:middle
And when they land on the one

00:36:48.016 --> 00:36:49.216 A:middle
that they want to activate a

00:36:49.536 --> 00:36:51.246 A:middle
double tap instead of doing

00:36:51.246 --> 00:36:52.276 A:middle
whatever the default behavior

00:36:52.276 --> 00:36:54.106 A:middle
will do will initiate that

00:36:54.106 --> 00:36:54.536 A:middle
action.

00:36:55.626 --> 00:36:57.626 A:middle
So, for instance, with our

00:36:57.626 --> 00:37:00.046 A:middle
delete we can create a custom

00:37:00.046 --> 00:37:02.106 A:middle
action called delete, set our

00:37:02.106 --> 00:37:04.046 A:middle
self as the target with our

00:37:04.046 --> 00:37:05.536 A:middle
delete cell action method that

00:37:05.536 --> 00:37:08.046 A:middle
returns a Boolean and that calls

00:37:08.046 --> 00:37:10.296 A:middle
the code for actually initiating

00:37:10.296 --> 00:37:11.146 A:middle
the delete of the cell.

00:37:12.346 --> 00:37:13.836 A:middle
On our cell, we're going to

00:37:13.836 --> 00:37:14.436 A:middle
override

00:37:14.436 --> 00:37:16.606 A:middle
accessibilityCustomActions to

00:37:16.606 --> 00:37:17.936 A:middle
contain this custom action.

00:37:18.626 --> 00:37:20.836 A:middle
Now because we're overriding it

00:37:20.956 --> 00:37:22.796 A:middle
on the cell and the cell itself

00:37:22.866 --> 00:37:24.356 A:middle
isn't an accessibilityElement,

00:37:24.356 --> 00:37:25.606 A:middle
all of its sub elements are.

00:37:26.276 --> 00:37:27.616 A:middle
All of its sub elements are

00:37:27.616 --> 00:37:29.246 A:middle
going to inherit the custom

00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:30.946 A:middle
actions of its parent.

00:37:31.166 --> 00:37:33.196 A:middle
So, I can actually initiate this

00:37:33.196 --> 00:37:34.956 A:middle
delete action from any of the

00:37:34.956 --> 00:37:37.996 A:middle
views on the cell.

00:37:38.946 --> 00:37:40.406 A:middle
Next, we have the default

00:37:40.406 --> 00:37:41.066 A:middle
activation.

00:37:41.296 --> 00:37:42.946 A:middle
So, what if we want to actually

00:37:42.946 --> 00:37:44.486 A:middle
override what the default

00:37:44.486 --> 00:37:46.516 A:middle
behavior is when a VoiceOver

00:37:46.516 --> 00:37:47.956 A:middle
user double taps on an element.

00:37:48.356 --> 00:37:49.626 A:middle
And that's what we're going to

00:37:49.626 --> 00:37:51.186 A:middle
use to fix the problem of

00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:53.086 A:middle
actually changing our settings.

00:37:54.756 --> 00:37:56.686 A:middle
What you can do is override

00:37:56.686 --> 00:37:58.996 A:middle
accessibilityActivate, which

00:37:58.996 --> 00:38:01.336 A:middle
returns a Boolean indicating

00:38:01.336 --> 00:38:02.806 A:middle
whether or not the activation

00:38:02.806 --> 00:38:03.506 A:middle
was successful.

00:38:05.836 --> 00:38:07.956 A:middle
So, for example with our switch

00:38:07.956 --> 00:38:10.226 A:middle
cells we can override

00:38:10.226 --> 00:38:12.626 A:middle
accessibilityActivate and set

00:38:12.626 --> 00:38:14.306 A:middle
whether or not the switch is on

00:38:14.736 --> 00:38:16.546 A:middle
based on its current on value.

00:38:16.546 --> 00:38:18.176 A:middle
And we're always going to return

00:38:18.176 --> 00:38:19.806 A:middle
true because we know that that

00:38:19.806 --> 00:38:21.096 A:middle
action is always going to be

00:38:21.096 --> 00:38:21.666 A:middle
successful.

00:38:22.126 --> 00:38:26.446 A:middle
Next, we have adjustable

00:38:26.446 --> 00:38:29.286 A:middle
elements, so our star rating is

00:38:29.286 --> 00:38:32.666 A:middle
adjustable and VoiceOver has a

00:38:32.666 --> 00:38:35.076 A:middle
mechanism for adjustable

00:38:35.076 --> 00:38:36.886 A:middle
elements to respond to increment

00:38:36.886 --> 00:38:37.816 A:middle
and decrement calls.

00:38:39.386 --> 00:38:41.956 A:middle
So, the first thing we want to

00:38:41.956 --> 00:38:43.796 A:middle
return in that element's traits

00:38:43.866 --> 00:38:45.536 A:middle
that it is an adjustable element

00:38:46.436 --> 00:38:48.296 A:middle
and that tells VoiceOver that

00:38:48.296 --> 00:38:50.056 A:middle
element is going to respond to

00:38:50.056 --> 00:38:52.156 A:middle
the accessibilityIncrement and

00:38:52.156 --> 00:38:53.966 A:middle
decrement calls which we can

00:38:53.966 --> 00:38:57.046 A:middle
override to do whatever behavior

00:38:57.046 --> 00:38:58.536 A:middle
we need when we increment and

00:38:58.536 --> 00:38:58.976 A:middle
decrement.

00:38:58.976 --> 00:39:02.486 A:middle
And a user adjusts an adjustable

00:39:02.486 --> 00:39:04.166 A:middle
element by swiping up and down

00:39:04.166 --> 00:39:04.766 A:middle
with their finger.

00:39:05.056 --> 00:39:07.626 A:middle
Up as an increment, down as a

00:39:08.336 --> 00:39:08.636 A:middle
decrement.

00:39:09.286 --> 00:39:12.066 A:middle
So, with our star's view we have

00:39:12.126 --> 00:39:13.706 A:middle
the number of stars that

00:39:13.706 --> 00:39:15.946 A:middle
whenever it's set has code that

00:39:15.946 --> 00:39:17.206 A:middle
actually adjusts the view

00:39:17.206 --> 00:39:17.916 A:middle
itself.

00:39:19.016 --> 00:39:20.516 A:middle
In its traits, we're going to

00:39:20.516 --> 00:39:22.166 A:middle
include the adjustable trait.

00:39:22.826 --> 00:39:24.846 A:middle
And in increment we're simply

00:39:24.846 --> 00:39:25.906 A:middle
going to increase the number of

00:39:25.906 --> 00:39:28.186 A:middle
stars by one and in decrement

00:39:28.186 --> 00:39:29.356 A:middle
we're going to decrease the

00:39:29.436 --> 00:39:31.156 A:middle
number of stars by one and now

00:39:31.156 --> 00:39:32.976 A:middle
that element is fully accessible

00:39:33.136 --> 00:39:34.186 A:middle
to our VoiceOver users.

00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:37.176 A:middle
Now I'd like to look at a

00:39:37.176 --> 00:39:38.416 A:middle
different problem that we didn't

00:39:38.416 --> 00:39:39.796 A:middle
see in our sample app.

00:39:40.886 --> 00:39:44.416 A:middle
So, VoiceOver has this concept

00:39:44.496 --> 00:39:46.976 A:middle
of pass-through which happens

00:39:46.976 --> 00:39:49.376 A:middle
when a VoiceOver user double

00:39:49.376 --> 00:39:51.566 A:middle
taps and holds their finger and

00:39:51.566 --> 00:39:53.846 A:middle
it passes through the panning

00:39:53.846 --> 00:39:55.986 A:middle
gesture so I can actually run my

00:39:55.986 --> 00:39:58.626 A:middle
finger across the screen and get

00:39:58.626 --> 00:40:00.016 A:middle
a more fine adjustment of a

00:40:00.016 --> 00:40:01.996 A:middle
slider like you see in this

00:40:01.996 --> 00:40:02.946 A:middle
photo's page here.

00:40:04.526 --> 00:40:06.716 A:middle
But we want a way to tell

00:40:06.716 --> 00:40:08.966 A:middle
VoiceOver where it should

00:40:08.966 --> 00:40:11.626 A:middle
actually focus that panning when

00:40:11.626 --> 00:40:13.796 A:middle
I initiate it because if I'm a

00:40:13.796 --> 00:40:16.106 A:middle
VoiceOver user then I probably

00:40:16.106 --> 00:40:19.056 A:middle
am not going to be able to

00:40:19.146 --> 00:40:21.376 A:middle
accurately land my finger on

00:40:21.376 --> 00:40:23.346 A:middle
that little sliding nub in the

00:40:23.346 --> 00:40:25.796 A:middle
center right, I don't actually

00:40:25.796 --> 00:40:27.736 A:middle
know where it is.

00:40:27.946 --> 00:40:28.796 A:middle
So, we're going to use

00:40:28.796 --> 00:40:31.326 A:middle
accessibilityActivationPoint

00:40:32.026 --> 00:40:33.726 A:middle
which is the point that tells

00:40:33.726 --> 00:40:35.106 A:middle
VoiceOver when a pass-through

00:40:35.106 --> 00:40:38.666 A:middle
occurs, what part of the UI do

00:40:38.666 --> 00:40:40.336 A:middle
you actually want to hook into.

00:40:40.946 --> 00:40:43.456 A:middle
So, for instance, if we have our

00:40:43.456 --> 00:40:45.986 A:middle
slider view where we have some

00:40:45.986 --> 00:40:48.336 A:middle
sort of slider nub then we can

00:40:48.336 --> 00:40:49.026 A:middle
override

00:40:49.026 --> 00:40:51.016 A:middle
accessibilityActivationPoint to

00:40:51.016 --> 00:40:52.376 A:middle
be the center of that nub so

00:40:52.626 --> 00:40:54.966 A:middle
that whenever the user passes

00:40:54.966 --> 00:40:57.196 A:middle
through that gesture it will

00:40:57.196 --> 00:40:58.636 A:middle
hook into the center of the nub

00:40:58.636 --> 00:40:59.606 A:middle
and start sliding there.

00:41:00.866 --> 00:41:04.736 A:middle
Next, we have custom scrolling,

00:41:05.266 --> 00:41:09.096 A:middle
so you may have views that have

00:41:09.506 --> 00:41:10.936 A:middle
swipe gestures on them that you

00:41:10.936 --> 00:41:12.926 A:middle
can use to get to different

00:41:12.926 --> 00:41:13.616 A:middle
parts of the UI.

00:41:13.616 --> 00:41:15.596 A:middle
For instance, in photos if I

00:41:15.596 --> 00:41:17.166 A:middle
swipe up then I get to my

00:41:17.166 --> 00:41:17.916 A:middle
details.

00:41:18.656 --> 00:41:20.546 A:middle
And there's a way that we can

00:41:20.546 --> 00:41:21.866 A:middle
get this behavior for VoiceOver

00:41:21.866 --> 00:41:22.666 A:middle
users as well.

00:41:24.136 --> 00:41:26.066 A:middle
It's called an

00:41:26.066 --> 00:41:27.826 A:middle
accessibilityScroll, it's

00:41:27.826 --> 00:41:29.296 A:middle
initiated by scrolling with

00:41:29.296 --> 00:41:31.296 A:middle
three fingers when VoiceOver is

00:41:31.296 --> 00:41:31.686 A:middle
on.

00:41:32.316 --> 00:41:33.616 A:middle
And it returns a Boolean to

00:41:33.616 --> 00:41:35.176 A:middle
indicate whether or not the

00:41:35.176 --> 00:41:36.316 A:middle
scroll was successful.

00:41:36.676 --> 00:41:37.946 A:middle
And it passes through a

00:41:37.946 --> 00:41:40.216 A:middle
direction so that you can change

00:41:40.216 --> 00:41:41.226 A:middle
the behavior based on what

00:41:41.226 --> 00:41:43.066 A:middle
direction the user is scrolling.

00:41:44.736 --> 00:41:46.186 A:middle
So, for example with our image

00:41:46.186 --> 00:41:47.676 A:middle
view if we wanted to show

00:41:47.676 --> 00:41:48.996 A:middle
details like we do in the Photos

00:41:48.996 --> 00:41:52.106 A:middle
app we'd have some property that

00:41:52.106 --> 00:41:53.276 A:middle
tells us whether or not we can

00:41:53.276 --> 00:41:54.836 A:middle
currently show the details and

00:41:54.946 --> 00:41:57.286 A:middle
we have code that actually goes

00:41:57.286 --> 00:41:58.676 A:middle
through and shows those details.

00:41:59.136 --> 00:42:00.826 A:middle
And so, what we're going to do

00:42:00.876 --> 00:42:02.786 A:middle
is override accessibilityScroll,

00:42:03.436 --> 00:42:05.966 A:middle
we're going to check can we show

00:42:05.966 --> 00:42:08.676 A:middle
our details and are we scrolling

00:42:08.676 --> 00:42:11.096 A:middle
in the right position or

00:42:11.096 --> 00:42:11.596 A:middle
direction.

00:42:12.336 --> 00:42:15.166 A:middle
And if we do we're going to show

00:42:15.166 --> 00:42:16.806 A:middle
our details and return true,

00:42:17.946 --> 00:42:20.716 A:middle
otherwise we're going to return

00:42:20.716 --> 00:42:21.136 A:middle
false.

00:42:21.496 --> 00:42:23.346 A:middle
And when I return false

00:42:23.616 --> 00:42:25.126 A:middle
VoiceOver is going to make a

00:42:25.126 --> 00:42:26.926 A:middle
bonking noise to indicate to the

00:42:26.926 --> 00:42:29.366 A:middle
user that whatever swipe that

00:42:29.366 --> 00:42:30.696 A:middle
they just did was not a valid

00:42:30.696 --> 00:42:31.026 A:middle
swipe.

00:42:31.836 --> 00:42:35.876 A:middle
Now I'm not going to go through

00:42:36.166 --> 00:42:37.666 A:middle
actually adding all those things

00:42:37.666 --> 00:42:40.416 A:middle
into our sample app, but they

00:42:40.416 --> 00:42:41.806 A:middle
are in the finished version of

00:42:41.806 --> 00:42:43.606 A:middle
the sample which you can find

00:42:43.606 --> 00:42:45.516 A:middle
and download at this URL.

00:42:46.136 --> 00:42:47.206 A:middle
And I recommend that you go and

00:42:47.206 --> 00:42:48.976 A:middle
check it out and see how that

00:42:48.976 --> 00:42:50.536 A:middle
code is implemented and see how

00:42:50.536 --> 00:42:51.956 A:middle
it works in action, play around

00:42:51.956 --> 00:42:52.476 A:middle
with it yourself.

00:42:54.416 --> 00:42:56.506 A:middle
Instead, I'd like to spend a

00:42:56.506 --> 00:42:58.416 A:middle
little bit of time talking about

00:42:58.416 --> 00:42:58.986 A:middle
Drag-and-Drop.

00:42:59.296 --> 00:43:02.256 A:middle
So, for those of you that missed

00:43:02.256 --> 00:43:04.356 A:middle
it at the keynote we unveiled

00:43:04.766 --> 00:43:06.186 A:middle
Drag-and-Drop finally coming to

00:43:06.346 --> 00:43:09.416 A:middle
iOS where I can drag pieces of

00:43:09.416 --> 00:43:11.146 A:middle
content and drop it in other

00:43:11.146 --> 00:43:12.426 A:middle
places in the interface.

00:43:12.586 --> 00:43:14.126 A:middle
For instance, if I have photos

00:43:14.126 --> 00:43:16.256 A:middle
open next to notes I can drag a

00:43:16.256 --> 00:43:18.656 A:middle
photo and drop it into one of my

00:43:18.656 --> 00:43:19.116 A:middle
notes.

00:43:20.246 --> 00:43:22.376 A:middle
Now because this was just

00:43:22.376 --> 00:43:24.486 A:middle
unveiled two days ago I don't

00:43:24.486 --> 00:43:26.106 A:middle
really expect all of you to

00:43:26.106 --> 00:43:27.786 A:middle
already understand how that API

00:43:27.876 --> 00:43:28.196 A:middle
works.

00:43:29.676 --> 00:43:31.136 A:middle
But there are just two key

00:43:31.136 --> 00:43:32.456 A:middle
concepts that you need to

00:43:32.456 --> 00:43:33.766 A:middle
understand before I talk about

00:43:33.766 --> 00:43:36.336 A:middle
the accessibility and that's

00:43:36.336 --> 00:43:38.646 A:middle
drag sources and drop points.

00:43:39.296 --> 00:43:41.266 A:middle
So, drag sources are all the

00:43:41.266 --> 00:43:43.186 A:middle
points on my view that I can

00:43:43.186 --> 00:43:45.476 A:middle
initiate a drag from and drop

00:43:45.476 --> 00:43:46.896 A:middle
points conversely are all the

00:43:46.896 --> 00:43:48.416 A:middle
places on my view that I can

00:43:48.416 --> 00:43:49.136 A:middle
drop content.

00:43:49.886 --> 00:43:53.076 A:middle
So, for instance, on the Home

00:43:53.076 --> 00:43:54.686 A:middle
screen which now uses

00:43:54.686 --> 00:43:56.116 A:middle
Drag-and-Drop for rearranging

00:43:56.116 --> 00:44:00.496 A:middle
icons I have three drop points

00:44:00.626 --> 00:44:03.026 A:middle
for each app when I'm moving

00:44:03.026 --> 00:44:03.346 A:middle
another.

00:44:03.976 --> 00:44:05.896 A:middle
The first is the left drop point

00:44:06.576 --> 00:44:10.726 A:middle
which allows me to drop the app

00:44:10.726 --> 00:44:11.936 A:middle
I'm currently moving to the left

00:44:11.936 --> 00:44:12.976 A:middle
and shift everything else to the

00:44:12.976 --> 00:44:13.286 A:middle
right.

00:44:13.286 --> 00:44:16.306 A:middle
I have the center drop point

00:44:16.306 --> 00:44:18.016 A:middle
that will create a folder

00:44:18.016 --> 00:44:19.116 A:middle
between the two apps.

00:44:19.336 --> 00:44:20.846 A:middle
And I have the right drop point

00:44:20.846 --> 00:44:23.256 A:middle
that will drop my current app to

00:44:23.256 --> 00:44:23.646 A:middle
the right.

00:44:24.236 --> 00:44:28.156 A:middle
And we need a way of describing

00:44:28.466 --> 00:44:31.376 A:middle
those different drag sources and

00:44:31.376 --> 00:44:33.136 A:middle
drop points to our VoiceOver

00:44:33.136 --> 00:44:33.686 A:middle
users.

00:44:33.886 --> 00:44:35.846 A:middle
And to do that we're going to

00:44:35.846 --> 00:44:37.566 A:middle
use this new API

00:44:38.196 --> 00:44:39.396 A:middle
accessibilityDrag

00:44:39.396 --> 00:44:40.876 A:middle
SourcesDescriptors and

00:44:40.876 --> 00:44:42.266 A:middle
accessibilityDrop

00:44:42.266 --> 00:44:43.236 A:middle
PointDescriptors.

00:44:43.786 --> 00:44:44.956 A:middle
They're arrays of

00:44:44.956 --> 00:44:45.966 A:middle
UIAccessibility

00:44:45.966 --> 00:44:48.216 A:middle
LocationDescriptor that

00:44:48.676 --> 00:44:50.136 A:middle
described the drags and the

00:44:50.136 --> 00:44:51.126 A:middle
drops for review.

00:44:52.106 --> 00:44:55.176 A:middle
So, we create a UIAccessibility

00:44:55.276 --> 00:44:57.196 A:middle
LocationDescriptor for each

00:44:57.196 --> 00:44:57.826 A:middle
drag-and-drop.

00:44:58.596 --> 00:45:00.966 A:middle
The view is going to be the view

00:45:00.966 --> 00:45:02.916 A:middle
that has the drag or drop

00:45:02.916 --> 00:45:04.396 A:middle
interaction associated with it.

00:45:05.006 --> 00:45:08.576 A:middle
The point is the point where the

00:45:08.576 --> 00:45:09.876 A:middle
drag is initiated from or the

00:45:09.876 --> 00:45:11.236 A:middle
drop is associated with.

00:45:11.716 --> 00:45:13.856 A:middle
And the name is meant to

00:45:13.856 --> 00:45:16.136 A:middle
describe what that drag or drop

00:45:16.276 --> 00:45:16.776 A:middle
does.

00:45:17.116 --> 00:45:18.486 A:middle
And there's even an attributed

00:45:18.486 --> 00:45:20.576 A:middle
name where you can use all those

00:45:20.576 --> 00:45:21.716 A:middle
attributed keys that I was

00:45:21.716 --> 00:45:23.546 A:middle
referring to earlier to tweak

00:45:23.546 --> 00:45:25.846 A:middle
the way that VoiceOver describes

00:45:26.556 --> 00:45:28.826 A:middle
the name of the descriptor.

00:45:29.806 --> 00:45:31.026 A:middle
So, let's take a look at how

00:45:31.026 --> 00:45:31.956 A:middle
this works in code.

00:45:33.006 --> 00:45:34.176 A:middle
Now this is just a hypothetical

00:45:34.176 --> 00:45:35.346 A:middle
example this isn't an actually

00:45:35.346 --> 00:45:36.056 A:middle
springboard code.

00:45:36.856 --> 00:45:38.016 A:middle
But let's say that I was

00:45:38.016 --> 00:45:40.736 A:middle
implementing rearranging apps

00:45:41.036 --> 00:45:42.816 A:middle
and I have a method that returns

00:45:43.116 --> 00:45:44.516 A:middle
an app view for a given index

00:45:44.516 --> 00:45:44.726 A:middle
path.

00:45:46.096 --> 00:45:47.026 A:middle
Well I'm going to start by

00:45:47.026 --> 00:45:48.926 A:middle
initializing that app view and

00:45:48.926 --> 00:45:50.816 A:middle
then I'm going to create a drag

00:45:50.816 --> 00:45:52.696 A:middle
descriptor and I'm going to give

00:45:52.696 --> 00:45:55.086 A:middle
it the name drag whatever the

00:45:55.086 --> 00:45:56.446 A:middle
app name is because that's what

00:45:56.446 --> 00:45:56.856 A:middle
I'm doing.

00:45:57.456 --> 00:45:59.116 A:middle
And then the center of where the

00:45:59.116 --> 00:46:00.866 A:middle
app is dragged from or sorry the

00:46:00.866 --> 00:46:01.796 A:middle
point where the app is dragged

00:46:01.796 --> 00:46:03.126 A:middle
from is its center.

00:46:04.026 --> 00:46:05.496 A:middle
And the view that actually has

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:07.036 A:middle
that drag interaction is myself.

00:46:07.806 --> 00:46:10.866 A:middle
Then I'm going to override the

00:46:10.866 --> 00:46:12.456 A:middle
app view's drag source

00:46:12.456 --> 00:46:14.436 A:middle
descriptors to include that new

00:46:14.626 --> 00:46:15.336 A:middle
drag descriptor.

00:46:15.656 --> 00:46:17.756 A:middle
Now let's look at the drops.

00:46:18.916 --> 00:46:20.716 A:middle
So, first of all, we need to

00:46:20.716 --> 00:46:22.696 A:middle
identify the points on my app

00:46:22.696 --> 00:46:24.586 A:middle
view where I actually want to

00:46:24.586 --> 00:46:25.726 A:middle
use the drop, the left and the

00:46:25.726 --> 00:46:26.956 A:middle
right point, I know where the

00:46:26.956 --> 00:46:27.686 A:middle
center is already.

00:46:27.686 --> 00:46:30.476 A:middle
And I'm going to create a

00:46:30.476 --> 00:46:31.676 A:middle
descriptor for each of those.

00:46:32.106 --> 00:46:33.676 A:middle
My leftDescriptor I'm going to

00:46:33.676 --> 00:46:35.456 A:middle
say drop left of blank,

00:46:36.686 --> 00:46:38.556 A:middle
folderDescriptor I'm going to

00:46:38.556 --> 00:46:40.416 A:middle
say create a folder with the app

00:46:41.286 --> 00:46:43.006 A:middle
and the rightDescriptor drop

00:46:43.006 --> 00:46:43.706 A:middle
right of the app.

00:46:44.246 --> 00:46:46.366 A:middle
And then I'm going to override

00:46:46.366 --> 00:46:47.416 A:middle
accessibilityDrop

00:46:47.416 --> 00:46:49.196 A:middle
PointDescriptors to include all

00:46:49.196 --> 00:46:51.826 A:middle
those new descriptors and I'll

00:46:51.826 --> 00:46:52.646 A:middle
return my app view.

00:46:52.926 --> 00:46:55.686 A:middle
And that's it, pretty simple.

00:46:56.276 --> 00:46:59.176 A:middle
But important to convey for the

00:46:59.176 --> 00:47:00.696 A:middle
VoiceOver user what each of your

00:47:00.696 --> 00:47:02.196 A:middle
Drag-and-Drop interactions are

00:47:02.196 --> 00:47:02.576 A:middle
like.

00:47:02.976 --> 00:47:04.606 A:middle
So, if you're going to implement

00:47:04.606 --> 00:47:06.936 A:middle
this feature then please take

00:47:06.936 --> 00:47:08.216 A:middle
the time to do the accessibility

00:47:08.216 --> 00:47:11.026 A:middle
for it as well.

00:47:12.726 --> 00:47:14.936 A:middle
Now I talked about a lot of

00:47:14.936 --> 00:47:16.896 A:middle
stuff today, we looked at some

00:47:16.896 --> 00:47:19.446 A:middle
new features, we looked at

00:47:19.446 --> 00:47:20.946 A:middle
auditing your own app for

00:47:20.946 --> 00:47:23.466 A:middle
accessibility, and we looked at

00:47:23.466 --> 00:47:25.156 A:middle
various portions of our API to

00:47:25.156 --> 00:47:26.506 A:middle
solve the problems that you find

00:47:26.506 --> 00:47:27.126 A:middle
while auditing.

00:47:27.856 --> 00:47:30.416 A:middle
And that's all great technical

00:47:30.416 --> 00:47:32.506 A:middle
stuff, but I want to bring it

00:47:32.506 --> 00:47:35.096 A:middle
back to the beginning to remind

00:47:35.096 --> 00:47:37.056 A:middle
you why we're all actually in

00:47:37.056 --> 00:47:37.596 A:middle
this room.

00:47:39.126 --> 00:47:42.146 A:middle
Accessibility is about people,

00:47:43.936 --> 00:47:46.696 A:middle
the common person's life is

00:47:46.756 --> 00:47:49.456 A:middle
enhanced by technology, but for

00:47:49.456 --> 00:47:51.656 A:middle
people with disabilities it's

00:47:51.656 --> 00:47:52.416 A:middle
transformative.

00:47:53.806 --> 00:47:55.486 A:middle
Accessible technology enables

00:47:55.486 --> 00:47:57.466 A:middle
people to live their lives the

00:47:57.466 --> 00:48:00.336 A:middle
way that they want to, to

00:48:00.336 --> 00:48:02.746 A:middle
accomplish goals and tasks that

00:48:02.746 --> 00:48:06.246 A:middle
were once unattainable, to have

00:48:06.246 --> 00:48:08.026 A:middle
jobs and roles in their

00:48:08.026 --> 00:48:10.276 A:middle
communities that they couldn't

00:48:10.276 --> 00:48:13.596 A:middle
have had before, and to interact

00:48:13.596 --> 00:48:15.136 A:middle
with the world in ways that were

00:48:15.136 --> 00:48:16.396 A:middle
once impossible.

00:48:17.206 --> 00:48:21.196 A:middle
The work that you do to ensure

00:48:21.196 --> 00:48:23.066 A:middle
that your apps work for everyone

00:48:23.446 --> 00:48:24.226 A:middle
is critical.

00:48:25.056 --> 00:48:28.006 A:middle
So, we thank you for the amazing

00:48:28.006 --> 00:48:29.756 A:middle
work that you've already done,

00:48:29.986 --> 00:48:31.796 A:middle
that you will continue to do,

00:48:31.976 --> 00:48:34.556 A:middle
and that you will start today as

00:48:34.556 --> 00:48:36.546 A:middle
we work together to make Apple's

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:38.096 A:middle
platforms more inclusive.

00:48:38.946 --> 00:48:43.246 A:middle
Now for more information, you

00:48:43.246 --> 00:48:44.646 A:middle
can go to this URL where we've

00:48:45.096 --> 00:48:46.696 A:middle
collected some URLs that are

00:48:46.696 --> 00:48:47.706 A:middle
helpful for you like some

00:48:47.706 --> 00:48:48.956 A:middle
developer documentation, as well

00:48:48.956 --> 00:48:50.286 A:middle
as our accessibility website.

00:48:50.286 --> 00:48:53.026 A:middle
And there are a couple of

00:48:53.026 --> 00:48:54.276 A:middle
related sessions, there are the

00:48:54.276 --> 00:48:55.396 A:middle
three sessions related to

00:48:55.396 --> 00:48:56.626 A:middle
dynamic type that I covered

00:48:56.626 --> 00:48:58.896 A:middle
before, and there's a media and

00:48:58.896 --> 00:49:01.496 A:middle
gaming accessibility talk

00:49:02.136 --> 00:49:03.546 A:middle
specifically for apps related to

00:49:03.546 --> 00:49:05.476 A:middle
media and gaming that's in this

00:49:05.476 --> 00:49:07.236 A:middle
room right after I'm done.

00:49:07.966 --> 00:49:09.826 A:middle
Thank you very much, have a

00:49:09.826 --> 00:49:10.846 A:middle
great rest of your conference.
