00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:25.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:27.606 A:middle
Good morning.

00:00:28.606 --> 00:00:29.796 A:middle
Welcome to our session,

00:00:29.886 --> 00:00:31.136 A:middle
Introducing Business Chat

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.526 A:middle
Developer Preview.

00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:33.946 A:middle
My name is Grant.

00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:35.366 A:middle
And today, I'm going to give you

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.596 A:middle
an overview of what Business

00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:38.836 A:middle
Chat is and some of the new

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:39.486 A:middle
features.

00:00:40.276 --> 00:00:42.166 A:middle
We'll also cover today what you

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.486 A:middle
can do during the developer

00:00:43.486 --> 00:00:46.046 A:middle
preview to get ready before the

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:47.506 A:middle
public launch next year.

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.736 A:middle
Later, my friend, Scotty, is

00:00:50.736 --> 00:00:52.086 A:middle
going to come up and he's going

00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:53.786 A:middle
to give us a demo of something

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:55.276 A:middle
we're calling Business Chat

00:00:55.276 --> 00:00:56.046 A:middle
Sandbox.

00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.436 A:middle
It's a great tool that going to

00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:01.706 A:middle
help you develop and test all

00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:01.706 A:middle
help you develop and test all

00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:02.706 A:middle
your solutions so that you're

00:01:02.706 --> 00:01:03.866 A:middle
ready for the public launch.

00:01:04.596 --> 00:01:06.146 A:middle
Are you ready?

00:01:06.686 --> 00:01:07.186 A:middle
Let's begin.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.926 A:middle
So the telephone has served us

00:01:10.926 --> 00:01:12.616 A:middle
well as customers but it's not

00:01:12.616 --> 00:01:14.406 A:middle
always the most ideal way to

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:15.566 A:middle
communicate with businesses.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.036 A:middle
Business Chat is important

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.036 A:middle
because it offers a more

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:21.076 A:middle
flexible and more capable

00:01:21.076 --> 00:01:21.856 A:middle
experience.

00:01:23.526 --> 00:01:24.986 A:middle
For example, sometimes you're

00:01:24.986 --> 00:01:26.336 A:middle
busy, you're running around.

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:28.446 A:middle
You need a way to resolve issues

00:01:28.446 --> 00:01:30.066 A:middle
without dedicating your time to

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:30.696 A:middle
a phone call.

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.076 A:middle
And you definitely don't want to

00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:34.566 A:middle
waste your time waiting on hold.

00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:38.036 A:middle
You need a way to communicate in

00:01:38.036 --> 00:01:39.576 A:middle
between the million other things

00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:41.606 A:middle
that you're doing, a way to

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:43.406 A:middle
communicate on your schedule.

00:01:44.046 --> 00:01:46.826 A:middle
And a telephone call is not

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:48.956 A:middle
visual and it's definitely not

00:01:48.956 --> 00:01:50.176 A:middle
as capable as an iPhone.

00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:52.496 A:middle
Sometimes you need to show the

00:01:52.496 --> 00:01:53.876 A:middle
business what you're seeing.

00:01:54.276 --> 00:01:55.526 A:middle
You might have an unfamiliar

00:01:55.526 --> 00:01:58.156 A:middle
product or need help with it or

00:01:58.156 --> 00:01:59.856 A:middle
maybe while you're chatting, you

00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:02.016 A:middle
might need to do something

00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:02.016 A:middle
might need to do something

00:02:02.016 --> 00:02:04.616 A:middle
interactive like choosing from

00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:07.756 A:middle
different options, scheduling an

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:10.326 A:middle
appointment, making a payment,

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:13.046 A:middle
or even interacting with an app

00:02:13.836 --> 00:02:15.106 A:middle
and that's Business Chat.

00:02:15.796 --> 00:02:18.606 A:middle
It's a powerful way for

00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:20.006 A:middle
customers to communicate with

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.366 A:middle
you and to complete tasks.

00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:24.000 A:middle

00:02:35.406 --> 00:02:36.596 A:middle
for customers to get in touch

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:38.116 A:middle
when they need you and you can

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:40.266 A:middle
help them with everything, all

00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:42.576 A:middle
in one message conversation,

have real interactions with your

customers while answering their

00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:49.476 A:middle
questions.

00:02:49.876 --> 00:02:51.326 A:middle
Help them learn more about your

00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:52.766 A:middle
products and link them straight

00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:53.636 A:middle
to the information they're

00:02:53.636 --> 00:02:54.000 A:middle
looking for.

00:02:56.056 --> 00:02:58.186 A:middle
Your customers can always come

00:02:58.186 --> 00:02:59.686 A:middle
right back to chat again and

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:02.066 A:middle
with long-lived sessions, you'll

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:02.066 A:middle
with long-lived sessions, you'll

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:04.786 A:middle
be ready with their information,

00:03:04.786 --> 00:03:06.646 A:middle
so it's easy for them and easy

00:03:06.646 --> 00:03:07.000 A:middle
for you.

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:09.576 A:middle
If customers already have a

00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:11.506 A:middle
product in mind, they can make

00:03:11.506 --> 00:03:12.516 A:middle
their purchase right in the

00:03:12.516 --> 00:03:13.896 A:middle

00:03:16.046 --> 00:03:18.166 A:middle
Integration with Apple Pay means

00:03:18.206 --> 00:03:19.976 A:middle
customers can pay securely with

00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:21.000 A:middle
just one touch.

00:03:25.716 --> 00:03:27.086 A:middle
They can also come back later to

00:03:27.216 --> 00:03:28.500 A:middle
track their orders.

00:03:29.686 --> 00:03:33.066 A:middle
All of this in one place.

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:04.166 A:middle
Business Chat is not launching

00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:05.846 A:middle
publicly yet because we want to

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:07.136 A:middle
make sure that we get this

00:04:07.136 --> 00:04:07.356 A:middle
right.

00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:09.536 A:middle
We know that elevating the

00:04:09.536 --> 00:04:11.016 A:middle
customer service experience

00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:12.666 A:middle
takes coordination.

00:04:13.196 --> 00:04:14.236 A:middle
It's going to take some time.

00:04:14.996 --> 00:04:15.926 A:middle
And we wanted to give you an

00:04:15.926 --> 00:04:18.505 A:middle
opportunity to get connected and

00:04:18.505 --> 00:04:20.196 A:middle
to integrate Business Chat into

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:21.986 A:middle
your operations ahead of the

00:04:21.986 --> 00:04:22.746 A:middle
public launch.

00:04:23.186 --> 00:04:25.846 A:middle
During the Developer Preview,

00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:27.126 A:middle
Business Chat will be

00:04:27.126 --> 00:04:29.706 A:middle
operational but your business

00:04:29.706 --> 00:04:30.906 A:middle
will not yet be publicly

00:04:30.906 --> 00:04:31.496 A:middle
accessible.

00:04:32.456 --> 00:04:34.116 A:middle
You will, however, be able to

00:04:34.116 --> 00:04:35.076 A:middle
white list some of your

00:04:35.076 --> 00:04:36.926 A:middle
employees who will be able to

00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:38.696 A:middle
test your end-to-end experience

00:04:39.006 --> 00:04:40.166 A:middle
to make sure that you're ready.

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:45.056 A:middle
So let's talk about how we're

00:04:45.056 --> 00:04:46.446 A:middle
making it easy for your

00:04:46.446 --> 00:04:48.726 A:middle
customers to find you and to

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:50.006 A:middle
start a conversation with your

00:04:50.006 --> 00:04:50.496 A:middle
business.

00:04:51.636 --> 00:04:53.106 A:middle
Once you have your Business Chat

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:54.916 A:middle
account, message buttons will

00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:56.706 A:middle
start appearing throughout iOS.

00:04:58.706 --> 00:05:00.446 A:middle
For example, this is how it

00:04:58.706 --> 00:05:00.446 A:middle
For example, this is how it

00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:01.366 A:middle
would look in Safari.

00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:03.856 A:middle
Customer might type your website

00:05:04.766 --> 00:05:06.036 A:middle
and a search result would appear

00:05:06.036 --> 00:05:07.346 A:middle
that highlights your business.

00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:10.566 A:middle
In this example, the user typed

00:05:10.566 --> 00:05:12.786 A:middle
"apple" and the search result

00:05:12.786 --> 00:05:14.656 A:middle
shows the nearby Apple Union

00:05:14.656 --> 00:05:15.436 A:middle
Square location.

00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:17.566 A:middle
And you can see that the message

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:18.926 A:middle
button is prominently featured.

00:05:20.456 --> 00:05:21.806 A:middle
Your user can start a

00:05:21.806 --> 00:05:24.076 A:middle
conversation right from here

00:05:24.076 --> 00:05:25.086 A:middle
instead of hunting on the

00:05:25.086 --> 00:05:25.976 A:middle
website for contact information.

00:05:26.776 --> 00:05:31.506 A:middle
Here is the Message button in

00:05:31.506 --> 00:05:36.096 A:middle
Search and in Siri and in Maps

00:05:37.556 --> 00:05:38.136 A:middle
too.

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:40.926 A:middle
The Message button can appear

00:05:41.116 --> 00:05:42.116 A:middle
for each one of your store

00:05:42.116 --> 00:05:42.926 A:middle
locations.

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:47.586 A:middle
We are also adding new support

00:05:47.636 --> 00:05:49.106 A:middle
for businesses that don't have

00:05:49.106 --> 00:05:50.896 A:middle
locations, including those that

00:05:50.896 --> 00:05:52.696 A:middle
might be online or app only.

00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:54.866 A:middle
Now if you're an online

00:05:54.866 --> 00:05:56.346 A:middle
business, or if there're no

00:05:56.346 --> 00:05:57.406 A:middle
nearby locations, there will

00:05:57.406 --> 00:05:58.806 A:middle
still be a search result

00:05:58.806 --> 00:05:59.766 A:middle
available for you.

00:06:00.596 --> 00:06:01.986 A:middle
This is how search results might

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:04.116 A:middle
look in Safari if Apple had no

00:06:04.116 --> 00:06:05.476 A:middle
nearby store locations.

00:06:05.936 --> 00:06:10.406 A:middle
Links are another great entry

00:06:10.406 --> 00:06:12.316 A:middle
point that you can use to invite

00:06:12.416 --> 00:06:14.076 A:middle
your customers into your

00:06:14.076 --> 00:06:15.396 A:middle
Business Chat conversation.

00:06:17.116 --> 00:06:18.466 A:middle
You can put links on your

00:06:18.466 --> 00:06:21.516 A:middle
websites, in your app, and in

00:06:21.516 --> 00:06:22.256 A:middle
your emails.

00:06:23.326 --> 00:06:24.846 A:middle
When your customer taps your

00:06:24.846 --> 00:06:27.056 A:middle
link, it will open your Business

00:06:27.056 --> 00:06:29.416 A:middle
Chat conversation on supporting

00:06:29.416 --> 00:06:31.576 A:middle
devices within the Messages app.

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:34.936 A:middle
To create your link, you'll need

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:38.706 A:middle
your Business Chat ID, which you

00:06:38.706 --> 00:06:40.076 A:middle
will receive after you create

00:06:40.076 --> 00:06:41.366 A:middle
your account.

00:06:44.256 --> 00:06:45.586 A:middle
The next feature that I'd like

00:06:45.586 --> 00:06:47.146 A:middle
to review is something called

00:06:47.146 --> 00:06:47.836 A:middle
Chat Intent.

00:06:48.856 --> 00:06:51.296 A:middle
Chat Intent is a great way to

00:06:51.296 --> 00:06:52.746 A:middle
provide better support to your

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.136 A:middle
customers by helping you

00:06:55.136 --> 00:06:57.116 A:middle
understand the context of their

00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:57.626 A:middle
question.

00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:01.096 A:middle
When you create links, you can

00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:01.096 A:middle
When you create links, you can

00:07:01.096 --> 00:07:02.996 A:middle
tag them to identify where your

00:07:02.996 --> 00:07:05.586 A:middle
customer tapped or clicked it.

00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:08.456 A:middle
There are two Chat Intent values

00:07:08.496 --> 00:07:09.316 A:middle
that you can use.

00:07:10.046 --> 00:07:11.796 A:middle
The first one is called intent

00:07:11.796 --> 00:07:14.796 A:middle
ID and the second one is group

00:07:14.796 --> 00:07:16.466 A:middle
ID, and they're completely

00:07:16.466 --> 00:07:16.936 A:middle
optional.

00:07:17.686 --> 00:07:18.876 A:middle
They could be whatever you need

00:07:18.876 --> 00:07:19.346 A:middle
them to be.

00:07:20.726 --> 00:07:22.146 A:middle
When your customer taps your

00:07:22.146 --> 00:07:24.426 A:middle
link and that link contains Chat

00:07:24.426 --> 00:07:26.856 A:middle
Intent values, those values will

00:07:26.856 --> 00:07:28.266 A:middle
be passed back to you with the

00:07:28.266 --> 00:07:28.836 A:middle
next message.

00:07:28.836 --> 00:07:30.766 A:middle
Let's see how you might use

00:07:30.766 --> 00:07:30.976 A:middle
them.

00:07:35.736 --> 00:07:36.846 A:middle
Let's say your customer is

00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:38.726 A:middle
browsing one of your products

00:07:39.016 --> 00:07:40.196 A:middle
and has a question about it.

00:07:41.576 --> 00:07:42.806 A:middle
You could use Chat Intent to

00:07:42.806 --> 00:07:44.626 A:middle
know the product config so your

00:07:44.626 --> 00:07:46.206 A:middle
customer doesn't need to type it

00:07:46.206 --> 00:07:46.506 A:middle
out.

00:07:48.356 --> 00:07:50.346 A:middle
For example, you could put the

00:07:50.346 --> 00:07:52.436 A:middle
product details or the product

00:07:52.436 --> 00:07:55.126 A:middle
code into the Intent field so

00:07:55.126 --> 00:07:56.556 A:middle
that your support agent can

00:07:56.556 --> 00:07:58.526 A:middle
provide a faster answer to your

00:07:58.786 --> 00:07:59.000 A:middle
customer.

00:08:01.216 --> 00:08:02.456 A:middle
Or maybe you have different

00:08:02.456 --> 00:08:04.066 A:middle
internal teams that offer

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:06.476 A:middle
specialized support, you could

00:08:06.476 --> 00:08:07.666 A:middle
use Chat Intent to route

00:08:07.666 --> 00:08:08.946 A:middle
messages to the relevant

00:08:08.996 --> 00:08:09.786 A:middle
internal team.

00:08:11.746 --> 00:08:12.846 A:middle
In this case, you could put the

00:08:12.896 --> 00:08:14.686 A:middle
team code into the group field

00:08:15.136 --> 00:08:16.236 A:middle
and that way you could route

00:08:16.236 --> 00:08:17.846 A:middle
incoming messages to the team

00:08:17.846 --> 00:08:19.296 A:middle
that handles that particular

00:08:19.296 --> 00:08:19.626 A:middle
issue.

00:08:20.206 --> 00:08:24.466 A:middle
And sometimes your customers may

00:08:24.466 --> 00:08:25.956 A:middle
want to chat with one of your

00:08:25.956 --> 00:08:27.206 A:middle
particular locations.

00:08:28.376 --> 00:08:29.996 A:middle
In the future, you will be able

00:08:29.996 --> 00:08:32.346 A:middle
to provide your locations and

00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:34.885 A:middle
your location IDs to Apple Maps.

00:08:35.586 --> 00:08:37.126 A:middle
Apple will automatically then

00:08:37.186 --> 00:08:39.405 A:middle
populate the Intent field with

00:08:39.405 --> 00:08:40.556 A:middle
your location ID.

00:08:41.566 --> 00:08:43.506 A:middle
That way when the customer taps

00:08:43.576 --> 00:08:47.296 A:middle
the message and sends their

00:08:47.296 --> 00:08:49.066 A:middle
message to that location, you

00:08:49.066 --> 00:08:51.076 A:middle
will know to which location they

00:08:51.076 --> 00:08:53.216 A:middle
were directing their message and

00:08:53.216 --> 00:08:54.236 A:middle
then you will be able to route

00:08:54.236 --> 00:08:55.276 A:middle
the message appropriately.

00:08:55.926 --> 00:09:00.036 A:middle
So we just reviewed all the ways

00:08:55.926 --> 00:09:00.036 A:middle
So we just reviewed all the ways

00:09:00.036 --> 00:09:01.606 A:middle
that your business might be

00:09:01.606 --> 00:09:02.556 A:middle
found by your customer.

00:09:03.386 --> 00:09:05.246 A:middle
But once your customer taps that

00:09:05.246 --> 00:09:07.196 A:middle
Message button, they are then

00:09:07.196 --> 00:09:09.156 A:middle
taken to your conversation

00:09:09.626 --> 00:09:10.836 A:middle
inside of the Messages app.

00:09:11.816 --> 00:09:12.956 A:middle
So let's explore some of the

00:09:12.956 --> 00:09:14.726 A:middle
features of those Business Chat

00:09:14.726 --> 00:09:15.586 A:middle
conversations.

00:09:16.156 --> 00:09:19.956 A:middle
It's important to note that your

00:09:19.956 --> 00:09:21.426 A:middle
customer must send the first

00:09:21.426 --> 00:09:23.006 A:middle
message to open the

00:09:23.006 --> 00:09:23.726 A:middle
conversation.

00:09:24.336 --> 00:09:25.976 A:middle
But once that conversation is

00:09:25.976 --> 00:09:28.016 A:middle
open, you can then message back

00:09:28.516 --> 00:09:30.206 A:middle
or send important notifications.

00:09:31.666 --> 00:09:33.126 A:middle
With your customer's message,

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:35.226 A:middle
you will also receive that

00:09:35.226 --> 00:09:37.046 A:middle
customer's opaque ID.

00:09:38.186 --> 00:09:40.376 A:middle
This is a unique ID designed to

00:09:40.426 --> 00:09:42.816 A:middle
preserve their anonymity until

00:09:42.816 --> 00:09:43.716 A:middle
they're ready to share more

00:09:43.746 --> 00:09:45.136 A:middle
personal information with you.

00:09:45.776 --> 00:09:48.476 A:middle
In addition, you will also

00:09:48.476 --> 00:09:50.896 A:middle
receive the customer's language

00:09:51.396 --> 00:09:53.956 A:middle
and device region so that you

00:09:53.956 --> 00:09:55.396 A:middle
can route their message to the

00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:57.276 A:middle
internal team that's best

00:09:57.276 --> 00:09:58.626 A:middle
equipped to answer their

00:09:58.626 --> 00:09:58.976 A:middle
question.

00:09:59.676 --> 00:10:04.016 A:middle
As we saw in the video, the

00:09:59.676 --> 00:10:04.016 A:middle
As we saw in the video, the

00:10:04.016 --> 00:10:05.796 A:middle
conversation session is long

00:10:05.796 --> 00:10:06.006 A:middle
lived.

00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:09.336 A:middle
Your customer can return and

00:10:09.336 --> 00:10:10.636 A:middle
pick up where they left off at

00:10:10.636 --> 00:10:11.206 A:middle
any time.

00:10:12.296 --> 00:10:13.666 A:middle
They should be able to just jump

00:10:13.666 --> 00:10:15.066 A:middle
in and ask a quick question

00:10:15.376 --> 00:10:16.906 A:middle
without having to re-identify

00:10:16.906 --> 00:10:17.546 A:middle
themselves.

00:10:18.396 --> 00:10:19.646 A:middle
And you can have their account

00:10:19.646 --> 00:10:21.696 A:middle
information ready so they can

00:10:21.696 --> 00:10:23.536 A:middle
get help without wasting time

00:10:23.536 --> 00:10:24.916 A:middle
describing what you should

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:28.936 A:middle
already know.

00:10:29.376 --> 00:10:30.676 A:middle
After your customer sends the

00:10:30.676 --> 00:10:32.416 A:middle
first message, you might need

00:10:32.416 --> 00:10:34.346 A:middle
some personal details to assist

00:10:34.406 --> 00:10:34.556 A:middle
them.

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:36.376 A:middle
So let's say you needed their

00:10:36.376 --> 00:10:36.986 A:middle
phone number.

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:40.296 A:middle
You might ask and the QuickType

00:10:40.296 --> 00:10:42.026 A:middle
keyboard will make intelligent

00:10:42.026 --> 00:10:44.136 A:middle
suggestions so your customer can

00:10:44.136 --> 00:10:47.226 A:middle
reply with just a tap.

00:10:47.666 --> 00:10:48.966 A:middle
The QuickType keyboard can make

00:10:48.966 --> 00:10:50.666 A:middle
intelligent suggestions so your

00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:52.226 A:middle
customers can easily provide

00:10:52.226 --> 00:10:54.586 A:middle
their email address, their phone

00:10:54.586 --> 00:10:56.996 A:middle
number, their postal address,

00:10:57.566 --> 00:11:01.506 A:middle
and even their location.

00:10:57.566 --> 00:11:01.506 A:middle
and even their location.

00:11:02.116 --> 00:11:04.636 A:middle
Messages is a very personal

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:05.026 A:middle
area.

00:11:05.616 --> 00:11:07.046 A:middle
This is where your customers

00:11:07.046 --> 00:11:08.456 A:middle
communicate with their friends

00:11:08.456 --> 00:11:08.926 A:middle
and family.

00:11:09.956 --> 00:11:11.826 A:middle
It's important to us that users

00:11:11.826 --> 00:11:13.506 A:middle
never receive unsolicited

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:14.176 A:middle
messages.

00:11:14.916 --> 00:11:16.506 A:middle
We wanted to give users full

00:11:16.506 --> 00:11:17.396 A:middle
control over their

00:11:17.396 --> 00:11:18.936 A:middle
communications with businesses.

00:11:20.516 --> 00:11:21.436 A:middle
Users can manage their

00:11:21.436 --> 00:11:23.736 A:middle
conversations by hiding alerts

00:11:24.386 --> 00:11:25.836 A:middle
or by deleting the conversation.

00:11:26.426 --> 00:11:29.696 A:middle
When they hide alerts, they will

00:11:29.696 --> 00:11:31.706 A:middle
continue to receive messages but

00:11:31.706 --> 00:11:32.766 A:middle
they won't be notified.

00:11:33.496 --> 00:11:34.246 A:middle
And if they delete the

00:11:34.246 --> 00:11:36.066 A:middle
conversation, that will block

00:11:36.166 --> 00:11:37.546 A:middle
all future messages from you.

00:11:38.166 --> 00:11:40.456 A:middle
Next, attachments.

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:44.546 A:middle
Because Business Chat is within

00:11:44.546 --> 00:11:46.216 A:middle
the Messages app, Business Chat

00:11:46.216 --> 00:11:47.656 A:middle
supports all of the standard

00:11:47.656 --> 00:11:49.796 A:middle
attachment types like photos,

00:11:50.446 --> 00:11:52.596 A:middle
videos, and documents.

00:11:53.746 --> 00:11:55.546 A:middle
For example, your customer might

00:11:55.616 --> 00:11:57.386 A:middle
send a photo of a product they

00:11:57.386 --> 00:11:59.796 A:middle
might need, or your customer

00:11:59.796 --> 00:12:01.806 A:middle
might send a video of an area of

00:11:59.796 --> 00:12:01.806 A:middle
might send a video of an area of

00:12:01.806 --> 00:12:03.626 A:middle
their house to help you provide

00:12:03.626 --> 00:12:05.936 A:middle
a more accurate quote and you

00:12:05.936 --> 00:12:07.776 A:middle
can use attachments to send

00:12:07.776 --> 00:12:09.126 A:middle
forms or other important

00:12:09.126 --> 00:12:09.706 A:middle
information.

00:12:13.216 --> 00:12:15.056 A:middle
Next, let's cover some ways that

00:12:15.056 --> 00:12:16.456 A:middle
you can provide a better

00:12:16.456 --> 00:12:17.766 A:middle
experience to your customers.

00:12:18.956 --> 00:12:20.016 A:middle
We wanted to create some

00:12:20.016 --> 00:12:22.046 A:middle
built-in features that help you

00:12:22.046 --> 00:12:24.346 A:middle
provide a consistent engaging

00:12:24.346 --> 00:12:26.326 A:middle
experience for some common use

00:12:26.326 --> 00:12:26.766 A:middle
cases.

00:12:27.776 --> 00:12:29.306 A:middle
It's important to note that

00:12:29.306 --> 00:12:31.426 A:middle
these features are built in, so

00:12:31.426 --> 00:12:32.926 A:middle
they're available for you even

00:12:32.926 --> 00:12:34.286 A:middle
if you don't have your own app.

00:12:36.296 --> 00:12:38.266 A:middle
The first is Time Picker.

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:41.226 A:middle
Scheduling appointments is a

00:12:41.266 --> 00:12:42.306 A:middle
common use case.

00:12:43.626 --> 00:12:45.356 A:middle
You can use Time Picker to send

00:12:45.356 --> 00:12:47.566 A:middle
over a list of proposed times to

00:12:47.566 --> 00:12:48.636 A:middle
your customer to review.

00:12:49.776 --> 00:12:51.366 A:middle
Your customer can see if they

00:12:51.366 --> 00:12:53.176 A:middle
have a conflict with existing

00:12:53.176 --> 00:12:54.176 A:middle
appointments that they might

00:12:54.176 --> 00:12:54.956 A:middle
have in Calendar.

00:12:56.316 --> 00:12:58.196 A:middle
Your customer can review and

00:12:58.196 --> 00:13:00.246 A:middle
then choose the best option and

00:12:58.196 --> 00:13:00.246 A:middle
then choose the best option and

00:13:00.326 --> 00:13:04.206 A:middle
send their choice back to you.

00:13:04.526 --> 00:13:06.116 A:middle
Choosing from a list of options

00:13:06.116 --> 00:13:07.706 A:middle
is also another common use case.

00:13:08.726 --> 00:13:09.956 A:middle
We created List Picker so you

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.876 A:middle
can provide a visual way to make

00:13:11.876 --> 00:13:12.436 A:middle
a selection.

00:13:14.656 --> 00:13:16.246 A:middle
With List Picker, you can send

00:13:16.246 --> 00:13:18.096 A:middle
your customer a list of options.

00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:21.016 A:middle
Your customer can select one or

00:13:21.016 --> 00:13:22.686 A:middle
more, depending on how you

00:13:22.686 --> 00:13:25.106 A:middle
configured it, and then send a

00:13:25.106 --> 00:13:26.156 A:middle
choice back to you.

00:13:29.296 --> 00:13:30.716 A:middle
Lastly, we know that payments is

00:13:30.716 --> 00:13:31.856 A:middle
another common use case.

00:13:32.596 --> 00:13:34.796 A:middle
Apple Pay provides an easy and

00:13:34.796 --> 00:13:37.876 A:middle
secure way to pay.

00:13:38.076 --> 00:13:39.306 A:middle
And if you're also a retailer

00:13:39.306 --> 00:13:40.516 A:middle
that wants a quick check-out

00:13:40.546 --> 00:13:43.006 A:middle
process, customers can quickly

00:13:43.006 --> 00:13:44.526 A:middle
and securely provide their

00:13:44.676 --> 00:13:47.186 A:middle
payment, shipping, and contact

00:13:47.186 --> 00:13:49.196 A:middle
information and then check out

00:13:49.276 --> 00:13:49.966 A:middle
with just one touch.

00:13:55.356 --> 00:13:57.416 A:middle
The built-in features that we

00:13:57.416 --> 00:13:58.886 A:middle
just covered offer a great

00:13:58.886 --> 00:14:00.486 A:middle
experience for some common use

00:13:58.886 --> 00:14:00.486 A:middle
experience for some common use

00:14:00.486 --> 00:14:00.866 A:middle
cases.

00:14:01.366 --> 00:14:02.726 A:middle
But we know that these just

00:14:02.726 --> 00:14:04.076 A:middle
scratch the surface of what's

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:04.396 A:middle
needed.

00:14:05.346 --> 00:14:06.936 A:middle
To customize the experience for

00:14:06.936 --> 00:14:09.156 A:middle
your business, you can extend

00:14:09.156 --> 00:14:10.706 A:middle
Business Chat by using the

00:14:10.786 --> 00:14:12.566 A:middle
iMessage app framework released

00:14:12.566 --> 00:14:14.476 A:middle
last year in iOS 10.

00:14:15.096 --> 00:14:18.936 A:middle
With the Messages framework, you

00:14:18.936 --> 00:14:20.986 A:middle
can create app experiences that

00:14:20.986 --> 00:14:22.736 A:middle
your customers can use directly

00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:23.906 A:middle
within Business Chat.

00:14:24.636 --> 00:14:26.686 A:middle
Essentially, you can pull in

00:14:26.686 --> 00:14:28.156 A:middle
parts of your app into the

00:14:28.156 --> 00:14:30.116 A:middle
conversation just when your

00:14:30.166 --> 00:14:31.086 A:middle
customer needs it.

00:14:32.226 --> 00:14:33.456 A:middle
Your app can appear like a

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:34.136 A:middle
message bubble.

00:14:34.656 --> 00:14:36.386 A:middle
For example, if the customer

00:14:36.386 --> 00:14:37.706 A:middle
needed to select their seats,

00:14:38.186 --> 00:14:39.126 A:middle
they could get a bubble like

00:14:39.216 --> 00:14:42.436 A:middle
this, tap it, and then quickly

00:14:42.436 --> 00:14:43.000 A:middle
complete the task.

00:14:47.516 --> 00:14:53.596 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:14:54.096 --> 00:14:55.896 A:middle
With iMessage apps, you can

00:14:56.046 --> 00:14:57.616 A:middle
speed customers through common

00:14:57.616 --> 00:14:59.436 A:middle
issues and improve your support

00:14:59.436 --> 00:15:00.326 A:middle
team productivity.

00:14:59.436 --> 00:15:00.326 A:middle
team productivity.

00:15:02.606 --> 00:15:04.456 A:middle
And Business Chat is a great way

00:15:04.456 --> 00:15:06.176 A:middle
to introduce customers to your

00:15:06.176 --> 00:15:06.356 A:middle
app.

00:15:07.496 --> 00:15:08.816 A:middle
If your customer doesn't yet

00:15:08.816 --> 00:15:10.426 A:middle
have your app installed, they

00:15:10.426 --> 00:15:12.016 A:middle
can tap to get the app right

00:15:12.116 --> 00:15:14.000 A:middle
from within the conversation.

00:15:17.326 --> 00:15:18.256 A:middle
You can use your app to

00:15:18.256 --> 00:15:20.436 A:middle
customize the look and behavior

00:15:20.436 --> 00:15:22.306 A:middle
of Messages using Live Message

00:15:22.306 --> 00:15:22.706 A:middle
layouts.

00:15:24.416 --> 00:15:25.706 A:middle
You can customize the bubble,

00:15:25.706 --> 00:15:27.766 A:middle
for example, by adding a map or

00:15:27.766 --> 00:15:30.456 A:middle
a live countdown, a simple form,

00:15:31.576 --> 00:15:33.176 A:middle
or any other interaction that

00:15:33.176 --> 00:15:35.306 A:middle
you create using your app.

00:15:35.856 --> 00:15:39.036 A:middle
To learn more about how to

00:15:39.036 --> 00:15:40.946 A:middle
create iMessage apps, go to

00:15:41.186 --> 00:15:44.526 A:middle
developer.apple.com/imessage.

00:15:45.326 --> 00:15:49.416 A:middle
Next, let's talk about getting

00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:49.926 A:middle
connected.

00:15:50.656 --> 00:15:53.886 A:middle
As a business, you're going to

00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:55.666 A:middle
need a customer service platform

00:15:55.946 --> 00:15:57.216 A:middle
that supports Business Chat.

00:15:58.756 --> 00:15:59.926 A:middle
Your platform will help you

00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:01.856 A:middle
connect, route messages

00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:01.856 A:middle
connect, route messages

00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:03.636 A:middle
internally, and provide

00:16:03.786 --> 00:16:04.826 A:middle
productivity tools for your

00:16:04.826 --> 00:16:05.116 A:middle
team.

00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:08.326 A:middle
Your platform will also help

00:16:08.326 --> 00:16:10.116 A:middle
connect your apps into your

00:16:10.116 --> 00:16:11.226 A:middle
support operations.

00:16:12.526 --> 00:16:13.936 A:middle
This is so that your team can

00:16:13.936 --> 00:16:16.796 A:middle
send app experiences to your

00:16:18.576 --> 00:16:18.826 A:middle
customers.

00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:21.316 A:middle
As a business, you need to apply

00:16:21.416 --> 00:16:23.326 A:middle
for the developer preview at

00:16:23.326 --> 00:16:24.696 A:middle
register.apple.com.

00:16:26.296 --> 00:16:28.186 A:middle
Likewise, if you are a customer

00:16:28.186 --> 00:16:29.646 A:middle
service platform that supports

00:16:29.646 --> 00:16:31.976 A:middle
Messaging, you can also apply to

00:16:32.006 --> 00:16:33.296 A:middle
offer Business Chat to your

00:16:33.296 --> 00:16:34.776 A:middle
clients too.

00:16:37.856 --> 00:16:39.996 A:middle
So once your account is approved

00:16:39.996 --> 00:16:42.056 A:middle
for Business Chat, you could

00:16:42.056 --> 00:16:43.226 A:middle
receive messages from Apple

00:16:43.226 --> 00:16:43.816 A:middle
devices.

00:16:44.816 --> 00:16:45.946 A:middle
Let's say your customer sends a

00:16:45.946 --> 00:16:46.596 A:middle
message to you.

00:16:46.836 --> 00:16:48.546 A:middle
This message will first arrive

00:16:48.546 --> 00:16:50.146 A:middle
on Apple's Business Chat server.

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:52.966 A:middle
From there, messages are passed

00:16:52.966 --> 00:16:54.156 A:middle
to your customer service

00:16:54.156 --> 00:16:58.056 A:middle
platform, and then your platform

00:16:58.366 --> 00:17:00.076 A:middle
will route messages to the

00:16:58.366 --> 00:17:00.076 A:middle
will route messages to the

00:17:00.076 --> 00:17:01.626 A:middle
appropriate person or team

00:17:01.836 --> 00:17:02.866 A:middle
within your business.

00:17:03.536 --> 00:17:05.876 A:middle
When they respond, your message

00:17:05.876 --> 00:17:07.096 A:middle
is routed back to your customer.

00:17:07.675 --> 00:17:10.445 A:middle
As I mentioned, during Business

00:17:10.445 --> 00:17:12.596 A:middle
Chat developer preview, your

00:17:12.596 --> 00:17:13.996 A:middle
business is not yet publicly

00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:14.566 A:middle
accessible.

00:17:15.536 --> 00:17:17.185 A:middle
However, you can white list

00:17:17.185 --> 00:17:19.076 A:middle
employees and these employees

00:17:19.076 --> 00:17:20.606 A:middle
can test the full experience,

00:17:21.266 --> 00:17:22.476 A:middle
interact with your iMessage

00:17:22.476 --> 00:17:23.935 A:middle
apps, and make sure that

00:17:23.935 --> 00:17:25.536 A:middle
everything is working properly.

00:17:26.215 --> 00:17:30.516 A:middle
OK, let's go through how to get

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:30.956 A:middle
started.

00:17:31.776 --> 00:17:33.726 A:middle
There are three things that you

00:17:33.726 --> 00:17:34.506 A:middle
can do today.

00:17:35.026 --> 00:17:36.956 A:middle
First, start developing.

00:17:37.476 --> 00:17:38.756 A:middle
You can use the Business Chat

00:17:38.756 --> 00:17:40.326 A:middle
Sandbox that Scotty will take us

00:17:40.326 --> 00:17:41.036 A:middle
through next.

00:17:42.026 --> 00:17:44.556 A:middle
Second, get connected on a

00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:46.066 A:middle
customer service platform that

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:47.146 A:middle
supports Business Chat.

00:17:48.196 --> 00:17:50.616 A:middle
And then, apply for early access

00:17:50.616 --> 00:17:51.986 A:middle
to Business Chat.

00:17:53.536 --> 00:17:55.876 A:middle
With that, Scotty will take us

00:17:55.876 --> 00:17:57.006 A:middle
through a demo Business Chat

00:17:57.006 --> 00:17:59.026 A:middle
Sandbox and how you can use it

00:17:59.026 --> 00:18:01.376 A:middle
to start developing and testing

00:17:59.026 --> 00:18:01.376 A:middle
to start developing and testing

00:18:01.406 --> 00:18:02.476 A:middle
your use cases.

[ Applause ]

00:18:12.816 --> 00:18:14.786 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Alright, thanks, Grant.

00:18:16.246 --> 00:18:17.516 A:middle
We're real excited about

00:18:17.516 --> 00:18:18.106 A:middle
Business Chat.

00:18:18.846 --> 00:18:20.336 A:middle
We have developed an entire

00:18:20.486 --> 00:18:21.906 A:middle
platform that will allow

00:18:21.906 --> 00:18:23.386 A:middle
everyone to communicate with

00:18:23.386 --> 00:18:25.496 A:middle
businesses directly through one

00:18:25.496 --> 00:18:26.986 A:middle
of the most used apps on the

00:18:27.086 --> 00:18:28.056 A:middle
planet, Messages.

00:18:29.466 --> 00:18:31.186 A:middle
And, as you've seen, we've built

00:18:31.186 --> 00:18:32.576 A:middle
in some great software into

00:18:32.576 --> 00:18:34.676 A:middle
every iOS 11 device that makes

00:18:34.676 --> 00:18:36.176 A:middle
performing these common business

00:18:36.176 --> 00:18:39.216 A:middle
tasks simple and fun, including

00:18:39.216 --> 00:18:41.416 A:middle
making payments using Apple Pay,

00:18:41.976 --> 00:18:43.676 A:middle
way better than trying to give

00:18:43.676 --> 00:18:44.636 A:middle
your credit card information

00:18:44.636 --> 00:18:45.256 A:middle
over the phone.

00:18:47.276 --> 00:18:48.866 A:middle
And it's even way more secure.

00:18:52.786 --> 00:18:54.416 A:middle
Now, you can mix these built-in

00:18:54.416 --> 00:18:56.176 A:middle
features with your own custom

00:18:56.176 --> 00:18:57.826 A:middle
messages apps that you create

00:18:58.976 --> 00:19:00.396 A:middle
and we think there's some real

00:18:58.976 --> 00:19:00.396 A:middle
and we think there's some real

00:19:00.396 --> 00:19:01.856 A:middle
opportunity here for you to

00:19:01.856 --> 00:19:03.936 A:middle
create some new really amazing

00:19:03.936 --> 00:19:05.346 A:middle
customer engagement experiences.

00:19:06.166 --> 00:19:08.046 A:middle
Now we were so excited about all

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:09.396 A:middle
of this, we wanted everyone to

00:19:09.396 --> 00:19:11.416 A:middle
be able to try this out today

00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:12.966 A:middle
using your iOS 11 device.

00:19:13.536 --> 00:19:16.826 A:middle
As message app developers, you

00:19:16.826 --> 00:19:18.006 A:middle
can try integrating with your

00:19:18.006 --> 00:19:18.706 A:middle
messages apps.

00:19:19.086 --> 00:19:20.606 A:middle
As customer service platforms,

00:19:20.606 --> 00:19:22.126 A:middle
you can see what formats we're

00:19:22.126 --> 00:19:24.256 A:middle
sending over the wire, or as a

00:19:24.256 --> 00:19:25.636 A:middle
business owner or someone who's

00:19:25.636 --> 00:19:27.186 A:middle
just interested, you can use the

00:19:27.246 --> 00:19:29.166 A:middle
Sandbox to dream up the next

00:19:29.166 --> 00:19:30.796 A:middle
great customer experience

00:19:30.796 --> 00:19:31.516 A:middle
engagement.

00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:34.696 A:middle
So what did we do?

00:19:35.586 --> 00:19:38.066 A:middle
Well, as Grant showed, we have

00:19:38.326 --> 00:19:39.666 A:middle
this flow of information that

00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:40.466 A:middle
goes through and what we've

00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:42.906 A:middle
created as the Sandbox is a way

00:19:43.536 --> 00:19:44.956 A:middle
-- Sandbox is pretty much like

00:19:44.956 --> 00:19:46.006 A:middle
your own customer service

00:19:46.066 --> 00:19:47.946 A:middle
platform that we've created and

00:19:47.946 --> 00:19:49.476 A:middle
we've put a web frontend on it.

00:19:50.316 --> 00:19:51.306 A:middle
Now your business might have its

00:19:51.306 --> 00:19:53.016 A:middle
own web frontend but in this

00:19:53.046 --> 00:19:54.616 A:middle
case, this is a Sandbox

00:19:54.616 --> 00:19:55.656 A:middle
environment and you can use to

00:19:55.696 --> 00:19:57.926 A:middle
play and we think it'll be great

00:19:57.926 --> 00:19:58.866 A:middle
so you can experience these

00:19:58.866 --> 00:19:59.316 A:middle
features.

00:20:00.136 --> 00:20:01.356 A:middle
So instead of talking about it,

00:20:01.356 --> 00:20:01.896 A:middle
let me give you a demo right

00:20:01.896 --> 00:20:01.963 A:middle
now.

00:20:02.146 --> 00:20:06.496 A:middle
So I'm going to switch over to

00:20:06.566 --> 00:20:09.556 A:middle
the demo device here and I have

00:20:09.936 --> 00:20:11.696 A:middle
loaded up here the website for

00:20:11.696 --> 00:20:12.856 A:middle
Business Chat Sandbox on the

00:20:12.856 --> 00:20:15.036 A:middle
left and I have an iPhone here

00:20:15.036 --> 00:20:15.696 A:middle
on the right.

00:20:16.826 --> 00:20:19.206 A:middle
And as Grant mentioned, the

00:20:19.696 --> 00:20:20.796 A:middle
interactions with businesses

00:20:20.796 --> 00:20:22.596 A:middle
have to be started by your iOS

00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:22.916 A:middle
device.

00:20:23.506 --> 00:20:24.836 A:middle
Grant highlighted a lot of great

00:20:24.836 --> 00:20:26.976 A:middle
ways that you can get to your

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:29.166 A:middle
Business Chat through things

00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:31.116 A:middle
like Maps and Siri, but another

00:20:31.116 --> 00:20:32.346 A:middle
great way is QR codes.

00:20:32.876 --> 00:20:34.586 A:middle
And this has highlighted a new

00:20:34.586 --> 00:20:36.336 A:middle
feature on iOS 11 where you can

00:20:36.336 --> 00:20:39.706 A:middle
use your camera app to hover

00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:41.856 A:middle
over a QR code, which I'm going

00:20:41.856 --> 00:20:44.856 A:middle
to do now, and you'll see up

00:20:44.856 --> 00:20:48.026 A:middle
pops a message notification.

00:20:48.486 --> 00:20:50.986 A:middle
I can just tap this guy and I'm

00:20:51.296 --> 00:20:52.176 A:middle
brought right into messages

00:20:52.176 --> 00:20:53.276 A:middle
ready to start a communication

00:20:53.276 --> 00:20:53.976 A:middle
with Business Chat Sandbox.

00:20:54.516 --> 00:20:58.876 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:59.376 --> 00:21:00.626 A:middle
So keep in mind, this is the

00:20:59.376 --> 00:21:00.626 A:middle
So keep in mind, this is the

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:01.216 A:middle
setup process.

00:21:01.216 --> 00:21:03.076 A:middle
I have logged in with my iCloud

00:21:03.176 --> 00:21:05.266 A:middle
account to Business Chat Sandbox

00:21:05.636 --> 00:21:06.926 A:middle
and I've scanned this QR code

00:21:07.076 --> 00:21:08.376 A:middle
and I'm ready to start talking

00:21:08.376 --> 00:21:08.846 A:middle
to a business.

00:21:09.236 --> 00:21:10.506 A:middle
I don't know any other platform

00:21:10.506 --> 00:21:11.736 A:middle
that has it this easy.

00:21:12.006 --> 00:21:14.186 A:middle
So let's start sending a really

00:21:14.326 --> 00:21:16.436 A:middle
profound message and say, "Hi."

00:21:18.426 --> 00:21:19.946 A:middle
And you'll see, boom, on the

00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:21.686 A:middle
left, the Business Chat Sandbox

00:21:21.726 --> 00:21:23.116 A:middle
updates since I've made

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:24.276 A:middle
communication with that

00:21:24.276 --> 00:21:24.796 A:middle
business.

00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:26.356 A:middle
So what do we have here?

00:21:26.606 --> 00:21:28.866 A:middle
Well, along the top we have a

00:21:28.866 --> 00:21:30.066 A:middle
bunch of tabs that highlight

00:21:30.196 --> 00:21:32.196 A:middle
different functionality of

00:21:32.256 --> 00:21:33.046 A:middle
Business Chat.

00:21:33.636 --> 00:21:34.946 A:middle
We have Text so you can send

00:21:34.946 --> 00:21:35.826 A:middle
text back and forth.

00:21:36.636 --> 00:21:37.836 A:middle
We have Attachment so you can

00:21:37.836 --> 00:21:39.746 A:middle
try sending files and other

00:21:39.746 --> 00:21:40.966 A:middle
types of attachments back and

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:41.226 A:middle
forth.

00:21:42.246 --> 00:21:43.386 A:middle
We have the Time Picker that

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:44.216 A:middle
Grant highlighted.

00:21:44.916 --> 00:21:46.276 A:middle
We have List Picker to be able

00:21:46.276 --> 00:21:47.356 A:middle
to pick from a list.

00:21:48.036 --> 00:21:49.146 A:middle
We have everyone's favorite

00:21:49.146 --> 00:21:50.936 A:middle
Apple Pay to collect payments

00:21:50.936 --> 00:21:51.526 A:middle
from customers.

00:21:52.396 --> 00:21:54.416 A:middle
We have My App, which allows you

00:21:54.416 --> 00:21:56.926 A:middle
to test integrating with your

00:21:56.926 --> 00:21:58.406 A:middle
own custom messages app.

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:01.246 A:middle
And Raw JSON, which lets you try

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:01.246 A:middle
And Raw JSON, which lets you try

00:22:01.246 --> 00:22:03.696 A:middle
out and modify the JSON and see

00:22:03.696 --> 00:22:05.736 A:middle
what happens when you customize

00:22:05.786 --> 00:22:07.186 A:middle
this to your business

00:22:07.186 --> 00:22:07.616 A:middle
environment.

00:22:08.176 --> 00:22:12.096 A:middle
On the right, I have a

00:22:12.096 --> 00:22:14.086 A:middle
transcript showing the

00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:16.836 A:middle
communications between the

00:22:16.836 --> 00:22:18.116 A:middle
Sandbox and my device.

00:22:19.076 --> 00:22:22.016 A:middle
And at the bottom, we have a

00:22:22.016 --> 00:22:24.096 A:middle
JSON tab, which actually shows

00:22:24.096 --> 00:22:25.526 A:middle
you the formats that we're

00:22:25.526 --> 00:22:26.356 A:middle
sending over the wire.

00:22:26.716 --> 00:22:28.056 A:middle
This is really helpful when

00:22:28.056 --> 00:22:29.116 A:middle
you're developing customer

00:22:29.116 --> 00:22:31.016 A:middle
service platforms or your own

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.176 A:middle
messages apps to make sure

00:22:32.176 --> 00:22:32.996 A:middle
you're getting things right.

00:22:33.916 --> 00:22:36.896 A:middle
So as a business, over here I

00:22:36.896 --> 00:22:38.526 A:middle
might type a response to my

00:22:38.726 --> 00:22:40.136 A:middle
profound "hi" and say something

00:22:40.136 --> 00:22:41.736 A:middle
like, "How may I help you?"

00:22:42.056 --> 00:22:45.566 A:middle
And we can send that across and

00:22:45.566 --> 00:22:47.186 A:middle
you'll see that sends and, boom,

00:22:47.186 --> 00:22:48.706 A:middle
we get that right here, great,

00:22:48.706 --> 00:22:49.236 A:middle
on the device.

00:22:50.006 --> 00:22:50.996 A:middle
Great, so now we've established

00:22:50.996 --> 00:22:51.966 A:middle
communication.

00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:54.176 A:middle
Let's go to Attachments and see

00:22:54.176 --> 00:22:55.456 A:middle
how we can use Attachments to

00:22:55.456 --> 00:22:56.736 A:middle
communicate with our customers.

00:22:57.076 --> 00:22:58.086 A:middle
I have an image here.

00:22:58.086 --> 00:23:02.736 A:middle
We have some internals of what

00:22:58.086 --> 00:23:02.736 A:middle
We have some internals of what

00:23:02.736 --> 00:23:04.376 A:middle
the home pod might look like.

00:23:04.726 --> 00:23:05.836 A:middle
So yeah, let's send that to the

00:23:05.836 --> 00:23:06.346 A:middle
customer.

00:23:06.476 --> 00:23:07.626 A:middle
OK, great, I got it on the

00:23:07.626 --> 00:23:07.826 A:middle
right.

00:23:07.826 --> 00:23:08.796 A:middle
That's what the inside of the

00:23:08.796 --> 00:23:09.436 A:middle
home pod looks like.

00:23:09.496 --> 00:23:11.976 A:middle
Great. OK and we can even send

00:23:12.256 --> 00:23:12.616 A:middle
images back.

00:23:12.806 --> 00:23:15.186 A:middle
I can pull up the camera here

00:23:15.376 --> 00:23:18.186 A:middle
and the camera comes up here, I

00:23:18.186 --> 00:23:19.806 A:middle
can take a lovely photo of all

00:23:19.806 --> 00:23:20.446 A:middle
you in the audience.

00:23:21.246 --> 00:23:22.116 A:middle
Very good.

00:23:22.396 --> 00:23:24.066 A:middle
And I can send this now back to

00:23:24.066 --> 00:23:27.046 A:middle
the business and tell the

00:23:27.046 --> 00:23:27.876 A:middle
business, great.

00:23:27.876 --> 00:23:30.416 A:middle
Just give it a second to

00:23:30.416 --> 00:23:31.216 A:middle
receive.

00:23:31.566 --> 00:23:32.466 A:middle
And here it is.

00:23:32.466 --> 00:23:33.516 A:middle
Great. Now I've told the

00:23:33.516 --> 00:23:34.776 A:middle
business all the people looking

00:23:34.776 --> 00:23:35.696 A:middle
to communicate with them in the

00:23:35.696 --> 00:23:35.936 A:middle
future.

00:23:36.356 --> 00:23:36.966 A:middle
That's great [applause].

00:23:41.156 --> 00:23:44.656 A:middle
So let's create a scenario that

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:45.836 A:middle
you might want to go through as

00:23:45.836 --> 00:23:47.176 A:middle
a business to try out Business

00:23:47.176 --> 00:23:47.436 A:middle
Chat.

00:23:48.376 --> 00:23:50.956 A:middle
Let's go on my iOS device and we

00:23:50.956 --> 00:23:53.716 A:middle
want to highlight probably

00:23:53.716 --> 00:23:56.426 A:middle
something that people experience

00:23:57.246 --> 00:23:58.096 A:middle
pretty often.

00:23:58.716 --> 00:24:00.696 A:middle
Let's message this business and

00:23:58.716 --> 00:24:00.696 A:middle
Let's message this business and

00:24:00.696 --> 00:24:02.226 A:middle
say something like, "Let's check

00:24:02.406 --> 00:24:04.876 A:middle
the status of my orders."

00:24:05.486 --> 00:24:08.466 A:middle
Now this could be any business,

00:24:09.366 --> 00:24:10.546 A:middle
shipping any kind of order, so

00:24:10.546 --> 00:24:12.156 A:middle
we're going to send this to the

00:24:12.506 --> 00:24:14.766 A:middle
business and alright.

00:24:14.766 --> 00:24:16.306 A:middle
So now we're going to use the

00:24:16.306 --> 00:24:19.226 A:middle
List Picker to send a list of

00:24:19.226 --> 00:24:20.466 A:middle
items of the orders that the

00:24:20.466 --> 00:24:21.586 A:middle
business knows about to this

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:21.966 A:middle
customer.

00:24:23.266 --> 00:24:25.146 A:middle
Now as Grant mentioned, we have

00:24:25.146 --> 00:24:26.036 A:middle
long-lived IDs.

00:24:26.036 --> 00:24:27.896 A:middle
So previously I had already

00:24:28.646 --> 00:24:30.206 A:middle
authenticated myself, so the

00:24:30.206 --> 00:24:31.356 A:middle
business knows who I am.

00:24:32.146 --> 00:24:35.046 A:middle
So they can internally pull up

00:24:35.046 --> 00:24:36.356 A:middle
all of the orders that have been

00:24:36.356 --> 00:24:37.196 A:middle
assigned to that customer.

00:24:38.026 --> 00:24:39.276 A:middle
So I'm going to -- I have some

00:24:39.326 --> 00:24:40.946 A:middle
saved JSON example here that I'm

00:24:40.946 --> 00:24:43.226 A:middle
going to drag in and you'll see

00:24:43.226 --> 00:24:44.286 A:middle
I filled out the form here.

00:24:44.286 --> 00:24:45.896 A:middle
So what do we have?

00:24:45.896 --> 00:24:47.596 A:middle
At the top we have the received

00:24:47.596 --> 00:24:48.106 A:middle
message.

00:24:48.596 --> 00:24:50.276 A:middle
This is the message that gets

00:24:50.276 --> 00:24:51.406 A:middle
sent by the business and then

00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:54.256 A:middle
received onto the customer's

00:24:54.256 --> 00:24:54.566 A:middle
device.

00:24:55.526 --> 00:24:57.286 A:middle
You can see you can specify an

00:24:57.286 --> 00:24:57.846 A:middle
icon.

00:24:58.216 --> 00:24:59.456 A:middle
There's a title and subtitle of

00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:01.566 A:middle
the bubble and we have different

00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:01.566 A:middle
the bubble and we have different

00:25:01.656 --> 00:25:02.426 A:middle
size formats.

00:25:02.426 --> 00:25:04.186 A:middle
You can actually modify these to

00:25:04.186 --> 00:25:05.876 A:middle
whatever style you'd like.

00:25:07.166 --> 00:25:08.706 A:middle
Down below, we specify the

00:25:08.706 --> 00:25:08.956 A:middle
items.

00:25:09.536 --> 00:25:11.236 A:middle
So here we have -- You can see I

00:25:11.236 --> 00:25:12.606 A:middle
have some items here that I have

00:25:12.606 --> 00:25:13.026 A:middle
incoming.

00:25:13.026 --> 00:25:14.596 A:middle
I have some T-shirts delivering

00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:15.126 A:middle
today.

00:25:15.436 --> 00:25:17.496 A:middle
I have a new iPad Pro coming on

00:25:17.496 --> 00:25:19.396 A:middle
June 12th and some Yerba Mate

00:25:19.396 --> 00:25:20.286 A:middle
coming, delicious.

00:25:20.866 --> 00:25:22.876 A:middle
We can specify if we want to

00:25:22.876 --> 00:25:23.986 A:middle
select multiple items.

00:25:23.986 --> 00:25:25.626 A:middle
So this allows the customer to

00:25:25.626 --> 00:25:26.886 A:middle
pick from multiple instead of

00:25:26.886 --> 00:25:27.636 A:middle
one at a time.

00:25:27.986 --> 00:25:29.106 A:middle
For this case, let's talk about

00:25:29.106 --> 00:25:31.626 A:middle
just one shipment at the start.

00:25:31.626 --> 00:25:33.936 A:middle
And you see I can go ahead and

00:25:34.046 --> 00:25:36.106 A:middle
add or remove other items and

00:25:36.106 --> 00:25:37.726 A:middle
add or remove other sections as

00:25:37.726 --> 00:25:38.076 A:middle
well.

00:25:38.076 --> 00:25:39.256 A:middle
But we're just going to start

00:25:39.256 --> 00:25:40.656 A:middle
with this one section for this

00:25:41.556 --> 00:25:41.666 A:middle
case.

00:25:41.786 --> 00:25:43.076 A:middle
Down below I have the Reply

00:25:43.076 --> 00:25:43.516 A:middle
Message.

00:25:43.906 --> 00:25:45.496 A:middle
Reply Message is the look of the

00:25:45.496 --> 00:25:46.916 A:middle
bubble when I send back the

00:25:46.916 --> 00:25:48.296 A:middle
choice that I've made back to

00:25:48.296 --> 00:25:48.656 A:middle
the business.

00:25:49.826 --> 00:25:51.636 A:middle
Here, just like the received

00:25:51.636 --> 00:25:53.676 A:middle
message, I have title and

00:25:53.676 --> 00:25:55.476 A:middle
subtitle and I can specify the

00:25:55.476 --> 00:25:56.186 A:middle
icon style.

00:25:57.486 --> 00:25:59.176 A:middle
On the right, now, you can see

00:25:59.176 --> 00:26:01.576 A:middle
the JSON has been updated to

00:25:59.176 --> 00:26:01.576 A:middle
the JSON has been updated to

00:26:01.576 --> 00:26:04.056 A:middle
include all of the things I've

00:26:04.056 --> 00:26:05.106 A:middle
specified in the form.

00:26:05.716 --> 00:26:08.846 A:middle
We have a section for images

00:26:09.006 --> 00:26:11.536 A:middle
where we have base64 encoded

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:12.776 A:middle
images with an identifier.

00:26:13.746 --> 00:26:15.376 A:middle
Below that we have the List

00:26:15.376 --> 00:26:17.586 A:middle
Picker section where you specify

00:26:17.586 --> 00:26:19.186 A:middle
the sections and the items that

00:26:19.186 --> 00:26:21.056 A:middle
I've typed on the left, things

00:26:21.056 --> 00:26:23.306 A:middle
like the T-shirts, title, an

00:26:23.306 --> 00:26:24.386 A:middle
image identifier which

00:26:24.386 --> 00:26:26.046 A:middle
references the base64 encoded

00:26:26.046 --> 00:26:29.246 A:middle
image above, and my other items

00:26:29.456 --> 00:26:30.256 A:middle
and some other fields,

00:26:30.256 --> 00:26:32.276 A:middle
specifying order, subtitle, et

00:26:32.276 --> 00:26:32.836 A:middle
cetera.

00:26:33.286 --> 00:26:35.026 A:middle
Down below, you see we have the

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:36.276 A:middle
received message and reply

00:26:36.276 --> 00:26:38.326 A:middle
message mirroring what I've

00:26:38.326 --> 00:26:39.466 A:middle
entered on the left, which

00:26:39.466 --> 00:26:40.816 A:middle
specify how the bubbles will

00:26:40.816 --> 00:26:41.646 A:middle
look when I send them to my

00:26:41.646 --> 00:26:42.016 A:middle
device.

00:26:43.206 --> 00:26:44.626 A:middle
Alright, let's give this

00:26:44.626 --> 00:26:46.626 A:middle
customer a way to select from

00:26:46.626 --> 00:26:46.806 A:middle
these.

00:26:46.806 --> 00:26:47.646 A:middle
I'm going to send this to the

00:26:47.646 --> 00:26:49.976 A:middle
device and you see on the right

00:26:50.956 --> 00:26:55.326 A:middle
of my iPhone up comes bubble for

00:26:55.326 --> 00:26:56.376 A:middle
me to select the package.

00:26:57.056 --> 00:26:59.246 A:middle
When I tap this bubble, up come

00:26:59.246 --> 00:27:00.746 A:middle
the choices that I specified on

00:26:59.246 --> 00:27:00.746 A:middle
the choices that I specified on

00:27:00.746 --> 00:27:00.966 A:middle
the left.

00:27:01.516 --> 00:27:06.156 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:06.656 --> 00:27:09.456 A:middle
Great. So, let's take a look at

00:27:09.456 --> 00:27:09.766 A:middle
these.

00:27:09.766 --> 00:27:11.466 A:middle
So I'm really inquiring about

00:27:11.466 --> 00:27:12.366 A:middle
this iPad that I'm getting on

00:27:12.366 --> 00:27:12.896 A:middle
Monday.

00:27:13.276 --> 00:27:15.326 A:middle
So I'm going to select this and

00:27:15.416 --> 00:27:17.846 A:middle
you see I tap that and up comes

00:27:17.846 --> 00:27:18.876 A:middle
the response that I'm ready to

00:27:18.926 --> 00:27:19.756 A:middle
send back to the business.

00:27:20.586 --> 00:27:22.066 A:middle
I can go ahead and just send

00:27:22.066 --> 00:27:22.486 A:middle
that back.

00:27:23.086 --> 00:27:24.736 A:middle
And now in the Business Chat

00:27:24.736 --> 00:27:26.246 A:middle
Sandbox, in the transcript

00:27:26.636 --> 00:27:28.056 A:middle
you'll see that the List Picker

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:29.746 A:middle
response has been highlighted so

00:27:29.746 --> 00:27:31.236 A:middle
the business knows which item

00:27:31.236 --> 00:27:32.866 A:middle
I'm actually interested in.

00:27:33.866 --> 00:27:34.716 A:middle
Alright, great.

00:27:34.856 --> 00:27:36.306 A:middle
So, let's continue the

00:27:36.306 --> 00:27:37.296 A:middle
experience here.

00:27:37.446 --> 00:27:39.106 A:middle
Let's go from the business and

00:27:39.106 --> 00:27:42.496 A:middle
say, "What would you like help

00:27:43.336 --> 00:27:44.856 A:middle
with for this iPad?"

00:27:45.466 --> 00:27:48.946 A:middle
So what I really want to do is

00:27:48.946 --> 00:27:49.946 A:middle
this iPad is scheduled for

00:27:49.946 --> 00:27:52.366 A:middle
delivery on Monday but I don't

00:27:52.366 --> 00:27:53.316 A:middle
really want to wait around for

00:27:53.316 --> 00:27:53.846 A:middle
this to come.

00:27:53.846 --> 00:27:55.646 A:middle
I want to go and pick this up as

00:27:55.646 --> 00:27:58.316 A:middle
soon as possible, as this is one

00:27:58.316 --> 00:27:59.966 A:middle
of those new iPads.

00:27:59.966 --> 00:28:02.736 A:middle
So I'm going to say, "Let's

00:27:59.966 --> 00:28:02.736 A:middle
So I'm going to say, "Let's

00:28:02.736 --> 00:28:05.236 A:middle
schedule a pickup."

00:28:05.396 --> 00:28:06.286 A:middle
So we're assuming now this

00:28:06.346 --> 00:28:08.046 A:middle
business actually has some sort

00:28:08.046 --> 00:28:11.016 A:middle
of pickup location and to do

00:28:11.016 --> 00:28:11.976 A:middle
that we're going schedule a

00:28:11.976 --> 00:28:12.216 A:middle
time.

00:28:12.386 --> 00:28:13.296 A:middle
So we're going to switch to the

00:28:13.296 --> 00:28:14.986 A:middle
Time Picker so we can schedule a

00:28:14.986 --> 00:28:16.176 A:middle
time for me to go and pick up

00:28:16.176 --> 00:28:16.796 A:middle
that iPad.

00:28:17.576 --> 00:28:19.756 A:middle
I have some JSON saved down

00:28:19.756 --> 00:28:20.406 A:middle
below for that.

00:28:20.896 --> 00:28:26.896 A:middle
So I'm going to drag that in

00:28:26.896 --> 00:28:27.646 A:middle
[inaudible] and we'll try that

00:28:27.646 --> 00:28:27.986 A:middle
again.

00:28:28.976 --> 00:28:32.046 A:middle
OK. So here, we have specified

00:28:32.046 --> 00:28:33.036 A:middle
some different images and

00:28:33.036 --> 00:28:34.796 A:middle
different icon styles for

00:28:34.796 --> 00:28:35.546 A:middle
received message.

00:28:35.546 --> 00:28:37.146 A:middle
This is just like a List Picker.

00:28:37.146 --> 00:28:38.106 A:middle
It has a received message.

00:28:38.106 --> 00:28:39.556 A:middle
This is the bubble that comes in

00:28:40.016 --> 00:28:41.826 A:middle
to the customer's device.

00:28:42.696 --> 00:28:45.146 A:middle
I've set a title for "Hold iPad

00:28:45.146 --> 00:28:46.846 A:middle
for pickup" and a subtle

00:28:46.846 --> 00:28:47.546 A:middle
"Schedule a time."

00:28:48.376 --> 00:28:51.196 A:middle
I also have some details about

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:52.336 A:middle
this appointment or schedule.

00:28:52.776 --> 00:28:55.096 A:middle
I have a name and optionally you

00:28:55.096 --> 00:28:56.346 A:middle
can include location details.

00:28:57.226 --> 00:28:59.426 A:middle
So in this -- A lot of times,

00:28:59.656 --> 00:29:01.976 A:middle
you know, appointments include

00:28:59.656 --> 00:29:01.976 A:middle
you know, appointments include

00:29:01.976 --> 00:29:03.126 A:middle
an actual location that you're

00:29:03.126 --> 00:29:03.506 A:middle
going to.

00:29:03.506 --> 00:29:04.826 A:middle
And for that, we can let you

00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:08.126 A:middle
specify a name, a lat, long, and

00:29:08.196 --> 00:29:09.756 A:middle
then the user can actually route

00:29:09.756 --> 00:29:10.756 A:middle
to that on their device, which

00:29:10.756 --> 00:29:11.826 A:middle
I'll show you, momentarily.

00:29:12.326 --> 00:29:13.756 A:middle
Then we can specify time slots,

00:29:14.466 --> 00:29:17.476 A:middle
pick from a calendar, the time

00:29:17.476 --> 00:29:19.216 A:middle
of day, and the duration of that

00:29:19.216 --> 00:29:19.646 A:middle
appointment.

00:29:20.776 --> 00:29:22.496 A:middle
Down below, I have the reply

00:29:22.496 --> 00:29:24.566 A:middle
message which is used of course

00:29:24.566 --> 00:29:25.576 A:middle
to show what happens when you

00:29:25.636 --> 00:29:26.986 A:middle
send back the message to the

00:29:26.986 --> 00:29:27.406 A:middle
business.

00:29:28.436 --> 00:29:30.196 A:middle
Now on the right, you can see

00:29:30.786 --> 00:29:33.596 A:middle
the JSON has been updated to

00:29:33.596 --> 00:29:35.596 A:middle
also include our common images

00:29:35.596 --> 00:29:37.396 A:middle
format but below we have the

00:29:37.396 --> 00:29:40.046 A:middle
event details and this specifies

00:29:40.136 --> 00:29:41.416 A:middle
things like your time slots.

00:29:42.496 --> 00:29:44.376 A:middle
These are all GMT dates and

00:29:44.376 --> 00:29:45.766 A:middle
times with their duration in

00:29:45.766 --> 00:29:46.196 A:middle
seconds.

00:29:47.156 --> 00:29:49.686 A:middle
Below that, I have location

00:29:49.686 --> 00:29:51.096 A:middle
information specified with the

00:29:51.096 --> 00:29:53.956 A:middle
title, lat, long, and our

00:29:53.956 --> 00:29:55.236 A:middle
familiar received and reply

00:29:55.236 --> 00:29:55.746 A:middle
message.

00:29:55.746 --> 00:29:57.516 A:middle
So let's schedule this

00:29:57.516 --> 00:29:57.946 A:middle
appointment.

00:29:58.046 --> 00:30:00.256 A:middle
Time is marching on.

00:29:58.046 --> 00:30:00.256 A:middle
Time is marching on.

00:30:00.256 --> 00:30:02.356 A:middle
Let's send that over to the

00:30:02.356 --> 00:30:04.886 A:middle
device and you see now on the

00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:06.806 A:middle
iPhone here, I have a "Hold iPad

00:30:06.956 --> 00:30:07.856 A:middle
for pickup."

00:30:08.076 --> 00:30:09.336 A:middle
I can go ahead and tap this.

00:30:09.816 --> 00:30:12.186 A:middle
And you see we're displaying the

00:30:12.186 --> 00:30:13.676 A:middle
options that the user can choose

00:30:13.676 --> 00:30:14.536 A:middle
that I've selected.

00:30:14.796 --> 00:30:16.266 A:middle
I can show more or show less but

00:30:16.266 --> 00:30:18.516 A:middle
we by default show the top

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:18.906 A:middle
three.

00:30:19.866 --> 00:30:22.166 A:middle
I also -- We're tying in to iOS'

00:30:22.166 --> 00:30:23.486 A:middle
built-in functionality of

00:30:23.486 --> 00:30:24.906 A:middle
EventKit, so you can see if

00:30:24.906 --> 00:30:26.066 A:middle
there's any conflicts on your

00:30:26.066 --> 00:30:27.516 A:middle
calendar to help you better

00:30:27.516 --> 00:30:28.976 A:middle
schedule the time.

00:30:29.516 --> 00:30:34.456 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:34.956 --> 00:30:36.846 A:middle
Now I do have an appointment at

00:30:36.846 --> 00:30:38.656 A:middle
11:00 but this iPad is way more

00:30:38.656 --> 00:30:39.316 A:middle
important than that.

00:30:39.316 --> 00:30:40.316 A:middle
So I'm going to take an early

00:30:40.316 --> 00:30:42.206 A:middle
lunch and schedule for 11 a.m.

00:30:42.536 --> 00:30:43.506 A:middle
I'd like to go and pick up this

00:30:43.506 --> 00:30:43.716 A:middle
iPad.

00:30:43.716 --> 00:30:45.936 A:middle
So you see now I have the time

00:30:45.936 --> 00:30:46.736 A:middle
selected.

00:30:46.776 --> 00:30:47.986 A:middle
I can go ahead and send this

00:30:47.986 --> 00:30:49.606 A:middle
back to the Business Chat

00:30:49.606 --> 00:30:52.556 A:middle
Sandbox and in the transcript,

00:30:52.556 --> 00:30:54.656 A:middle
in the Sandbox, on the right, we

00:30:54.656 --> 00:30:55.766 A:middle
have the time that I've selected

00:30:55.766 --> 00:30:58.746 A:middle
notified to the business.

00:30:58.866 --> 00:31:00.266 A:middle
Now, I did mention that we have

00:30:58.866 --> 00:31:00.266 A:middle
Now, I did mention that we have

00:31:00.266 --> 00:31:01.336 A:middle
this location detail.

00:31:01.386 --> 00:31:05.086 A:middle
So on the iPhone, once I've sent

00:31:05.086 --> 00:31:06.816 A:middle
this back to the business, I can

00:31:06.816 --> 00:31:07.866 A:middle
actually go ahead and tap that

00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:09.956 A:middle
bubble and I get the information

00:31:09.956 --> 00:31:11.936 A:middle
that I've sent back, including

00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:13.456 A:middle
the time and location.

00:31:13.726 --> 00:31:15.256 A:middle
From here, I can easily add this

00:31:15.326 --> 00:31:16.596 A:middle
appointment right to my calendar

00:31:17.166 --> 00:31:18.006 A:middle
or get directions right in Maps

00:31:18.006 --> 00:31:18.606 A:middle
to the location that I've

00:31:18.606 --> 00:31:18.976 A:middle
specified.

00:31:19.516 --> 00:31:24.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:25.076 --> 00:31:28.136 A:middle
OK, we're going to close that.

00:31:28.136 --> 00:31:29.856 A:middle
Great. So these are highlighting

00:31:29.856 --> 00:31:30.486 A:middle
some of the built-in

00:31:30.486 --> 00:31:31.606 A:middle
interactions that you may

00:31:31.846 --> 00:31:33.396 A:middle
encounter when you're

00:31:34.026 --> 00:31:35.266 A:middle
interfacing with Business Chat,

00:31:35.436 --> 00:31:37.296 A:middle
but we also wanted to highlight

00:31:37.926 --> 00:31:39.366 A:middle
that you can integrate this with

00:31:39.366 --> 00:31:41.406 A:middle
your own messages apps and take

00:31:41.406 --> 00:31:42.556 A:middle
more advantage of the native

00:31:42.556 --> 00:31:43.516 A:middle
power of iOS.

00:31:44.006 --> 00:31:45.056 A:middle
So let's switch over to the My

00:31:45.056 --> 00:31:45.636 A:middle
App tab.

00:31:46.416 --> 00:31:48.016 A:middle
And let's talk about this.

00:31:48.786 --> 00:31:50.936 A:middle
From here, we have a bunch of

00:31:50.936 --> 00:31:52.776 A:middle
fields that you can use to

00:31:52.776 --> 00:31:53.866 A:middle
communicate with your message

00:31:53.866 --> 00:31:54.036 A:middle
app.

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:56.716 A:middle
The top two fields allow you to

00:31:56.716 --> 00:31:58.216 A:middle
link to the app, allow your

00:31:58.216 --> 00:31:59.256 A:middle
customer to link to the app in

00:31:59.256 --> 00:32:00.126 A:middle
case they don't have it

00:31:59.256 --> 00:32:00.126 A:middle
case they don't have it

00:32:00.126 --> 00:32:00.606 A:middle
installed.

00:32:01.036 --> 00:32:03.756 A:middle
You pull out your iTunes URL ID

00:32:03.756 --> 00:32:05.626 A:middle
and enter that here and you

00:32:05.626 --> 00:32:06.776 A:middle
provide your app name, which is

00:32:06.776 --> 00:32:08.296 A:middle
shown in the transcript.

00:32:09.456 --> 00:32:10.706 A:middle
Then we have the URL field.

00:32:11.306 --> 00:32:12.846 A:middle
So in messages apps, one of the

00:32:12.846 --> 00:32:14.306 A:middle
preferred ways to communicate

00:32:14.306 --> 00:32:15.796 A:middle
between your messages apps is

00:32:15.796 --> 00:32:16.976 A:middle
actually via URL.

00:32:17.276 --> 00:32:19.376 A:middle
And you can put URL keys and

00:32:19.376 --> 00:32:20.876 A:middle
values here that the app can

00:32:20.876 --> 00:32:21.306 A:middle
then read.

00:32:22.236 --> 00:32:23.376 A:middle
Down below we have the team

00:32:23.426 --> 00:32:24.646 A:middle
identifier and bundle

00:32:24.646 --> 00:32:25.236 A:middle
identifier.

00:32:25.676 --> 00:32:27.836 A:middle
These are used so iOS actually

00:32:27.836 --> 00:32:29.406 A:middle
knows which message extension to

00:32:29.406 --> 00:32:30.326 A:middle
instantiate.

00:32:30.876 --> 00:32:32.106 A:middle
And we have an optional session

00:32:32.136 --> 00:32:33.966 A:middle
identifier used in case you have

00:32:33.966 --> 00:32:35.966 A:middle
multiple message app

00:32:36.436 --> 00:32:37.666 A:middle
transactions going at once, you

00:32:37.666 --> 00:32:38.886 A:middle
can then identify, which one

00:32:38.886 --> 00:32:41.546 A:middle
you're actually talking about.

00:32:41.546 --> 00:32:43.376 A:middle
Live Message Layouts, as Grant

00:32:43.376 --> 00:32:44.526 A:middle
mentioned, is a new feature in

00:32:44.646 --> 00:32:46.856 A:middle
iOS 11 that lets your message

00:32:46.856 --> 00:32:48.566 A:middle
bubbles draw all the content,

00:32:49.086 --> 00:32:49.886 A:middle
providing way more

00:32:49.886 --> 00:32:51.346 A:middle
functionality, native

00:32:51.346 --> 00:32:52.946 A:middle
functionality from iOS, right in

00:32:52.946 --> 00:32:54.036 A:middle
the messages transcript.

00:32:55.346 --> 00:32:57.106 A:middle
However, if you're sending these

00:32:57.106 --> 00:32:59.726 A:middle
to older iOS devices, they might

00:32:59.726 --> 00:33:01.196 A:middle
not support Live Message Layout

00:32:59.726 --> 00:33:01.196 A:middle
not support Live Message Layout

00:33:01.196 --> 00:33:03.136 A:middle
as well as other platforms such

00:33:03.136 --> 00:33:04.106 A:middle
as the Mac or the Watch.

00:33:04.456 --> 00:33:07.136 A:middle
For that, we allow you to enter

00:33:07.136 --> 00:33:08.346 A:middle
the information that you may

00:33:08.346 --> 00:33:10.666 A:middle
have for the fallback bubble so

00:33:10.666 --> 00:33:11.976 A:middle
at least they can see that

00:33:11.976 --> 00:33:13.056 A:middle
something was received on those

00:33:13.056 --> 00:33:13.506 A:middle
devices.

00:33:14.396 --> 00:33:16.436 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead and

00:33:16.436 --> 00:33:19.006 A:middle
drag in some content I have for

00:33:19.406 --> 00:33:23.796 A:middle
the app here.

00:33:24.016 --> 00:33:25.596 A:middle
And OK, so now you see these

00:33:25.596 --> 00:33:27.346 A:middle
fields are filled out and I have

00:33:27.396 --> 00:33:29.426 A:middle
specified some URL parameters,

00:33:29.846 --> 00:33:30.946 A:middle
which are then read by the

00:33:30.946 --> 00:33:32.616 A:middle
built-in message app on the

00:33:32.616 --> 00:33:33.126 A:middle
device.

00:33:33.536 --> 00:33:35.516 A:middle
So I have preinstalled already

00:33:35.996 --> 00:33:39.266 A:middle
on this iPhone a message app so

00:33:39.836 --> 00:33:41.316 A:middle
I don't have to go and show you

00:33:41.316 --> 00:33:42.926 A:middle
how that can download from the

00:33:42.926 --> 00:33:43.336 A:middle
app store.

00:33:44.296 --> 00:33:45.516 A:middle
On the right, you can also see

00:33:45.516 --> 00:33:47.496 A:middle
the JSON contents is now updated

00:33:48.006 --> 00:33:49.216 A:middle
with the fields like you've seen

00:33:49.216 --> 00:33:52.016 A:middle
above, app ID, app name, URL,

00:33:52.616 --> 00:33:54.516 A:middle
some other information including

00:33:54.516 --> 00:33:55.806 A:middle
the received message fallback

00:33:55.806 --> 00:33:56.346 A:middle
information.

00:33:56.966 --> 00:33:59.096 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead and

00:33:59.096 --> 00:34:00.936 A:middle
send this but before I do,

00:33:59.096 --> 00:34:00.936 A:middle
send this but before I do,

00:34:00.936 --> 00:34:02.816 A:middle
remember I've established

00:34:02.816 --> 00:34:04.006 A:middle
communication with this business

00:34:04.006 --> 00:34:04.306 A:middle
already.

00:34:04.436 --> 00:34:07.476 A:middle
So time may have passed and what

00:34:07.476 --> 00:34:08.295 A:middle
this bubble is going to

00:34:08.426 --> 00:34:09.616 A:middle
highlight is I actually have a

00:34:09.616 --> 00:34:11.626 A:middle
shipment that's scheduled for

00:34:11.626 --> 00:34:12.326 A:middle
delivery today.

00:34:12.466 --> 00:34:13.886 A:middle
So I'm going to send that now

00:34:13.886 --> 00:34:15.516 A:middle
and you'll see that I have these

00:34:15.556 --> 00:34:19.376 A:middle
T-shirts scheduled for delivery

00:34:19.376 --> 00:34:20.766 A:middle
today at WWDC.

00:34:20.966 --> 00:34:21.826 A:middle
Now there's supposed to be --

00:34:21.826 --> 00:34:23.085 A:middle
There's the map there.

00:34:23.085 --> 00:34:24.346 A:middle
Hold up. I tapped the wrong guy

00:34:24.346 --> 00:34:24.545 A:middle
there.

00:34:24.545 --> 00:34:25.646 A:middle
So here's -- And it's showing me

00:34:25.775 --> 00:34:25.976 A:middle
a map.

00:34:31.806 --> 00:34:33.446 A:middle
Showing me a map of where those

00:34:33.446 --> 00:34:34.876 A:middle
are scheduled for delivery.

00:34:35.286 --> 00:34:36.476 A:middle
So this is [applause] -- This is

00:34:36.666 --> 00:34:40.996 A:middle
a -- This is just a notification

00:34:40.996 --> 00:34:42.356 A:middle
that may have come in randomly

00:34:42.525 --> 00:34:44.326 A:middle
as you have this Business Chat

00:34:44.876 --> 00:34:45.815 A:middle
environment set up.

00:34:46.366 --> 00:34:48.166 A:middle
But -- And actually, this is

00:34:48.166 --> 00:34:49.726 A:middle
also using Live Message Layout.

00:34:49.726 --> 00:34:51.306 A:middle
So you can see I have a map here

00:34:51.306 --> 00:34:53.186 A:middle
and the bubble format has this

00:34:53.266 --> 00:34:54.196 A:middle
green footer.

00:34:54.196 --> 00:34:55.505 A:middle
It doesn't look anything like

00:34:55.505 --> 00:34:56.596 A:middle
the bubbles that you may have

00:34:56.676 --> 00:34:57.416 A:middle
seen in iOS 10.

00:34:58.396 --> 00:34:59.376 A:middle
That's because this is all

00:34:59.376 --> 00:35:00.976 A:middle
drawing the content natively.

00:34:59.376 --> 00:35:00.976 A:middle
drawing the content natively.

00:35:01.996 --> 00:35:03.646 A:middle
So what you can see is I have

00:35:03.646 --> 00:35:04.556 A:middle
these T-shirts scheduled for

00:35:04.556 --> 00:35:06.136 A:middle
WWDC and they're scheduled for

00:35:06.176 --> 00:35:08.626 A:middle
delivery today but it looks like

00:35:08.626 --> 00:35:09.386 A:middle
on the map that they're

00:35:09.386 --> 00:35:10.826 A:middle
scheduled for somewhere in San

00:35:10.826 --> 00:35:11.346 A:middle
Francisco.

00:35:11.346 --> 00:35:12.326 A:middle
So that's not right.

00:35:12.716 --> 00:35:14.246 A:middle
Let's tap this bubble and bring

00:35:14.246 --> 00:35:16.756 A:middle
up our message app.

00:35:16.906 --> 00:35:19.026 A:middle
And now you can see that I have

00:35:19.026 --> 00:35:20.076 A:middle
incorrectly scheduled these

00:35:20.076 --> 00:35:21.256 A:middle
T-shirts for Moscone.

00:35:21.476 --> 00:35:22.906 A:middle
But now we're down in San Jose.

00:35:22.906 --> 00:35:23.686 A:middle
So we're going to have to do

00:35:23.686 --> 00:35:25.186 A:middle
something about that, but before

00:35:25.186 --> 00:35:27.576 A:middle
we do, you can see that this is

00:35:27.576 --> 00:35:29.806 A:middle
actually this is a live map that

00:35:29.806 --> 00:35:31.916 A:middle
I have here inside Messages.

00:35:32.426 --> 00:35:33.316 A:middle
Everything you can do with

00:35:33.316 --> 00:35:34.866 A:middle
Messages apps, you can do here

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:36.856 A:middle
in the Business Chat and this --

00:35:36.996 --> 00:35:38.176 A:middle
And we also have our current

00:35:38.176 --> 00:35:39.526 A:middle
location here in San Jose.

00:35:40.396 --> 00:35:41.886 A:middle
So you're able to tie in to all

00:35:41.886 --> 00:35:42.936 A:middle
of the great powerful features

00:35:42.936 --> 00:35:44.376 A:middle
of iOS, right in your business

00:35:44.376 --> 00:35:44.556 A:middle
chat.

00:35:45.206 --> 00:35:46.346 A:middle
This is not a web page.

00:35:47.816 --> 00:35:49.416 A:middle
So now we'd like to reroute

00:35:49.416 --> 00:35:50.386 A:middle
these to here because this is

00:35:50.386 --> 00:35:51.686 A:middle
the last day of the show and we

00:35:51.686 --> 00:35:52.806 A:middle
really got to get these T-shirts

00:35:52.806 --> 00:35:53.006 A:middle
here.

00:35:53.006 --> 00:35:54.656 A:middle
So I'm going to tap my current

00:35:54.656 --> 00:35:58.026 A:middle
location and let's specify that

00:35:58.026 --> 00:35:59.366 A:middle
we want the shipment rerouted to

00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:00.246 A:middle
my current location.

00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:00.246 A:middle
my current location.

00:36:00.246 --> 00:36:02.116 A:middle
There's a $15 charge but I'll

00:36:02.116 --> 00:36:02.926 A:middle
have to expense that.

00:36:02.926 --> 00:36:05.006 A:middle
We're going to go ahead and

00:36:05.006 --> 00:36:06.366 A:middle
confirm that we want this

00:36:06.366 --> 00:36:08.586 A:middle
rerouted to San Jose Convention

00:36:08.586 --> 00:36:09.496 A:middle
Center and I'm going to go ahead

00:36:09.496 --> 00:36:10.216 A:middle
and send that back to the

00:36:10.216 --> 00:36:10.556 A:middle
business.

00:36:10.636 --> 00:36:11.976 A:middle
And you'll see in the Business

00:36:11.976 --> 00:36:14.356 A:middle
Chat Sandbox, now we've received

00:36:14.356 --> 00:36:16.436 A:middle
the URL, which specifies the new

00:36:16.436 --> 00:36:18.536 A:middle
location that we've designated

00:36:18.646 --> 00:36:19.576 A:middle
for the shipment.

00:36:20.996 --> 00:36:22.546 A:middle
Great. So that's showing

00:36:23.616 --> 00:36:25.096 A:middle
integration with your messages

00:36:25.096 --> 00:36:25.366 A:middle
apps.

00:36:26.026 --> 00:36:27.286 A:middle
But there's one more thing and

00:36:27.346 --> 00:36:28.926 A:middle
that we've scheduled a reroute

00:36:28.926 --> 00:36:31.156 A:middle
and that's going to cost us $15.

00:36:31.716 --> 00:36:32.586 A:middle
So for that we're going to

00:36:32.586 --> 00:36:33.786 A:middle
request a payment from our

00:36:33.786 --> 00:36:36.376 A:middle
customers using Apple Pay.

00:36:36.616 --> 00:36:38.486 A:middle
Now I'm going to drag in our

00:36:38.486 --> 00:36:40.826 A:middle
Apple Pay JSON here and you see

00:36:40.826 --> 00:36:42.456 A:middle
we have our familiar received

00:36:42.456 --> 00:36:45.146 A:middle
message at the top specifying an

00:36:45.146 --> 00:36:47.886 A:middle
image and title and subtitle of

00:36:47.886 --> 00:36:48.896 A:middle
this bubble.

00:36:49.556 --> 00:36:51.556 A:middle
And down below, we can specify

00:36:51.556 --> 00:36:52.136 A:middle
our items.

00:36:52.226 --> 00:36:53.196 A:middle
Here, we have a same-day

00:36:53.196 --> 00:36:55.136 A:middle
shipment reroute that going to

00:36:55.136 --> 00:36:56.956 A:middle
cost you 15 bucks and we have a

00:36:56.956 --> 00:36:58.546 A:middle
total price as well.

00:36:59.056 --> 00:37:00.626 A:middle
Optionally now, we can also

00:36:59.056 --> 00:37:00.626 A:middle
Optionally now, we can also

00:37:00.626 --> 00:37:02.006 A:middle
specify shipping methods.

00:37:02.136 --> 00:37:05.066 A:middle
For this, this actually is the

00:37:05.216 --> 00:37:05.856 A:middle
reroute.

00:37:05.856 --> 00:37:07.216 A:middle
So I'm not going to specify

00:37:07.276 --> 00:37:08.016 A:middle
shipping methods.

00:37:08.356 --> 00:37:10.346 A:middle
We also have fields that you may

00:37:10.346 --> 00:37:11.926 A:middle
be familiar with if you've done

00:37:11.926 --> 00:37:13.086 A:middle
Apple Pay development in the

00:37:13.086 --> 00:37:13.546 A:middle
past.

00:37:14.166 --> 00:37:15.626 A:middle
We have -- If you'd like to

00:37:15.626 --> 00:37:17.546 A:middle
specify the Apple Pay sheet

00:37:17.546 --> 00:37:18.646 A:middle
should require your billing

00:37:18.646 --> 00:37:20.536 A:middle
address or your shipping address

00:37:20.536 --> 00:37:22.386 A:middle
and what merchant capabilities

00:37:22.386 --> 00:37:23.576 A:middle
your platform may contain.

00:37:24.506 --> 00:37:26.936 A:middle
Now these are all standard Apple

00:37:26.936 --> 00:37:29.276 A:middle
Pay functions.

00:37:29.416 --> 00:37:31.036 A:middle
We didn't do anything custom

00:37:31.036 --> 00:37:31.576 A:middle
here.

00:37:31.576 --> 00:37:33.106 A:middle
So if you're familiar developing

00:37:33.106 --> 00:37:34.866 A:middle
with Apple Pay, this is, these

00:37:34.866 --> 00:37:35.586 A:middle
are things that you've already

00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:36.056 A:middle
implemented.

00:37:36.856 --> 00:37:39.056 A:middle
We also followed a very common

00:37:39.126 --> 00:37:41.306 A:middle
Apple Pay JS format for the

00:37:41.306 --> 00:37:42.236 A:middle
JSON, which I'll show you over

00:37:42.236 --> 00:37:42.906 A:middle
here.

00:37:44.156 --> 00:37:46.246 A:middle
So for the JSON for this

00:37:46.246 --> 00:37:49.306 A:middle
request, we have our received

00:37:49.306 --> 00:37:52.486 A:middle
message and we have our images,

00:37:52.486 --> 00:37:54.726 A:middle
as you've seen before, but now

00:37:54.726 --> 00:37:56.776 A:middle
we have a payment object which

00:37:56.776 --> 00:37:58.136 A:middle
contains a payment request.

00:37:58.606 --> 00:38:00.296 A:middle
This contains line items, same

00:37:58.606 --> 00:38:00.296 A:middle
This contains line items, same

00:38:00.296 --> 00:38:01.946 A:middle
day shipment reroute for 15

00:38:02.086 --> 00:38:04.336 A:middle
bucks, and a total.

00:38:04.606 --> 00:38:06.846 A:middle
And then we also have our Apple

00:38:06.846 --> 00:38:09.216 A:middle
Pay section, which contains

00:38:09.216 --> 00:38:10.896 A:middle
information for what networks we

00:38:10.896 --> 00:38:12.586 A:middle
support, merchant capabilities,

00:38:12.916 --> 00:38:14.376 A:middle
and what types of currency we

00:38:14.376 --> 00:38:14.746 A:middle
support.

00:38:16.286 --> 00:38:17.276 A:middle
Now at the bottom, here, you'll

00:38:17.276 --> 00:38:19.346 A:middle
also see we have some other URLs

00:38:19.346 --> 00:38:21.296 A:middle
and this is kind of interesting.

00:38:21.296 --> 00:38:22.526 A:middle
So what we've done is we've

00:38:22.526 --> 00:38:24.676 A:middle
provided a bunch of URLs that

00:38:24.676 --> 00:38:26.026 A:middle
you can use when you integrate

00:38:26.026 --> 00:38:27.186 A:middle
Apple Pay with your business.

00:38:27.606 --> 00:38:29.066 A:middle
The first one, payment Gateway

00:38:29.066 --> 00:38:31.026 A:middle
URL, allows your business to

00:38:31.156 --> 00:38:33.536 A:middle
send its encrypted payload to

00:38:33.536 --> 00:38:34.686 A:middle
actually process the payment.

00:38:35.366 --> 00:38:38.206 A:middle
Great. We also have three URLs

00:38:38.206 --> 00:38:39.586 A:middle
that are used when the Apple Pay

00:38:39.586 --> 00:38:40.926 A:middle
sheet is up on the screen.

00:38:41.336 --> 00:38:42.426 A:middle
If you change your payment

00:38:42.536 --> 00:38:44.506 A:middle
method from let's say a debit

00:38:44.506 --> 00:38:45.826 A:middle
card to a credit card, we're

00:38:45.826 --> 00:38:48.046 A:middle
going to hit this URL so you may

00:38:48.046 --> 00:38:50.386 A:middle
want to in some cases maybe

00:38:50.526 --> 00:38:51.906 A:middle
change what offerings you have.

00:38:51.966 --> 00:38:53.066 A:middle
Some businesses may offer

00:38:53.066 --> 00:38:54.176 A:middle
discounts for certain types of

00:38:54.176 --> 00:38:54.586 A:middle
cards.

00:38:56.276 --> 00:38:57.206 A:middle
When you change your shipping

00:38:57.206 --> 00:38:59.006 A:middle
method, we also have a chance to

00:38:59.006 --> 00:39:00.766 A:middle
hit a server and update your

00:38:59.006 --> 00:39:00.766 A:middle
hit a server and update your

00:39:00.766 --> 00:39:01.476 A:middle
shipment items.

00:39:01.916 --> 00:39:04.316 A:middle
So let's say we are switching

00:39:04.376 --> 00:39:06.166 A:middle
from ground to overnight

00:39:06.166 --> 00:39:07.066 A:middle
delivery, we might have to

00:39:07.066 --> 00:39:08.246 A:middle
update your line items and your

00:39:08.246 --> 00:39:08.716 A:middle
total.

00:39:08.716 --> 00:39:10.926 A:middle
And then your shipping contact,

00:39:11.266 --> 00:39:12.536 A:middle
if suddenly I want this package

00:39:12.536 --> 00:39:14.676 A:middle
delivered to Hawaii, you might

00:39:14.676 --> 00:39:16.116 A:middle
want to update all your shipping

00:39:16.116 --> 00:39:17.696 A:middle
methods, line items, and totals.

00:39:18.396 --> 00:39:19.756 A:middle
We then have a fallback URL,

00:39:19.756 --> 00:39:21.216 A:middle
which is used in case the

00:39:21.216 --> 00:39:22.716 A:middle
customer doesn't have Apple Pay

00:39:22.716 --> 00:39:23.296 A:middle
on their device.

00:39:23.746 --> 00:39:25.596 A:middle
You can then specify a URL that

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:26.636 A:middle
when tapping the Apple Pay

00:39:26.636 --> 00:39:28.526 A:middle
bubble will take you to a web

00:39:28.526 --> 00:39:29.836 A:middle
page of your choice.

00:39:30.626 --> 00:39:31.746 A:middle
And then finally, an order

00:39:31.746 --> 00:39:32.526 A:middle
tracking URL.

00:39:32.876 --> 00:39:35.516 A:middle
This is used once the payment is

00:39:35.566 --> 00:39:36.276 A:middle
complete.

00:39:36.406 --> 00:39:37.186 A:middle
So we've already sent the

00:39:37.186 --> 00:39:38.016 A:middle
payment through the payment

00:39:38.016 --> 00:39:39.846 A:middle
gateway URL but your business

00:39:39.906 --> 00:39:41.966 A:middle
may have a separate system that

00:39:41.966 --> 00:39:43.056 A:middle
handles all your orders and

00:39:43.056 --> 00:39:44.386 A:middle
that's what this URL is used

00:39:44.386 --> 00:39:44.546 A:middle
for.

00:39:45.156 --> 00:39:47.916 A:middle
Great. OK, let's send this to

00:39:47.916 --> 00:39:50.156 A:middle
the device so we can collect

00:39:50.156 --> 00:39:51.446 A:middle
this $15 and gets these

00:39:51.446 --> 00:39:51.996 A:middle
T-shirts.

00:39:52.766 --> 00:39:54.856 A:middle
So you see on the device now up

00:39:54.856 --> 00:39:56.746 A:middle
comes our shipment reroute Apple

00:39:56.746 --> 00:39:56.976 A:middle
Pay Button.

00:39:57.076 --> 00:39:59.876 A:middle
And I can go ahead and just tap

00:39:59.876 --> 00:40:01.256 A:middle
this bubble and up pops the

00:39:59.876 --> 00:40:01.256 A:middle
this bubble and up pops the

00:40:01.256 --> 00:40:02.456 A:middle
familiar Apple Pay sheet.

00:40:03.376 --> 00:40:05.556 A:middle
From here, all I have to do is

00:40:05.696 --> 00:40:06.616 A:middle
touch ID.

00:40:06.846 --> 00:40:08.526 A:middle
The payment gets processed, sent

00:40:08.526 --> 00:40:10.266 A:middle
back to the business, and the

00:40:10.266 --> 00:40:11.596 A:middle
bubble is updated with paid, and

00:40:11.596 --> 00:40:11.776 A:middle
that's it.
