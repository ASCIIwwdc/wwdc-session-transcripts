[ Silence ]

00:00:07.516 --> 00:00:21.156 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:21.656 --> 00:00:22.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You all know that every app,

00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:24.776 A:middle
even your app, needs an app

00:00:24.826 --> 00:00:25.206 A:middle
icon.

00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:27.086 A:middle
It's the symbol that represents

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:28.876 A:middle
your product on the Home screen

00:00:29.086 --> 00:00:29.816 A:middle
and the App Store.

00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:32.566 A:middle
Humanity has been using symbols

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.016 A:middle
to communicate ideas since

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:37.346 A:middle
antiquity; even Apple was doing

00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:39.036 A:middle
this a long, long time ago.

00:00:39.686 --> 00:00:40.516 A:middle
I'm only joking.

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:41.346 A:middle
I'm only joking, of course.

00:00:41.456 --> 00:00:42.206 A:middle
I hope there are no

00:00:42.206 --> 00:00:42.996 A:middle
egyptologists [phonetic] in the

00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:43.766 A:middle
room that were offended.

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:45.756 A:middle
But in all seriousness, we have

00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:47.486 A:middle
a long rich history of using

00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:49.646 A:middle
symbols, literal, non-literal,

00:00:49.646 --> 00:00:51.016 A:middle
as a method of communication,

00:00:51.786 --> 00:00:53.326 A:middle
and we extend this to the modern

00:00:53.326 --> 00:00:54.606 A:middle
world, but we apply the same

00:00:54.606 --> 00:00:55.866 A:middle
principles to the user interface

00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:56.086 A:middle
design.

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:58.306 A:middle
For example, there was your

00:00:58.306 --> 00:00:58.946 A:middle
Macintosh.

00:00:59.206 --> 00:01:00.376 A:middle
We're going to take a quick trip

00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:02.146 A:middle
down memory lane and take a

00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:03.736 A:middle
closer look at some classic Mac

00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:04.836 A:middle
OS icons.

00:01:05.426 --> 00:01:06.816 A:middle
Many metaphors have stuck around

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.396 A:middle
for three decades of Mac OS.

00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:10.596 A:middle
Investing in simple application

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:12.086 A:middle
iconography was a way to

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:13.736 A:middle
emotionally relate to the user.

00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:15.166 A:middle
It made the system approachable

00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:16.646 A:middle
and easy to use.

00:01:17.426 --> 00:01:19.246 A:middle
It also made the platform unique

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:20.116 A:middle
and stand apart from the

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:20.736 A:middle
competition.

00:01:21.906 --> 00:01:24.016 A:middle
Many are close approximations of

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:26.076 A:middle
real world objects, and some

00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:27.446 A:middle
concepts might be a little on

00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:29.166 A:middle
the abstract side, but they all

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.386 A:middle
live within a system that tells

00:01:30.386 --> 00:01:31.176 A:middle
a user that they're

00:01:31.176 --> 00:01:31.906 A:middle
interconnected.

00:01:32.276 --> 00:01:33.686 A:middle
For example, they're

00:01:33.686 --> 00:01:34.826 A:middle
appropriate; some are families,

00:01:34.826 --> 00:01:36.786 A:middle
like families of maps or

00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:39.236 A:middle
families of documents, and due

00:01:39.236 --> 00:01:40.796 A:middle
to time, we've moved beyond some

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:41.796 A:middle
metaphors, either because the

00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:42.946 A:middle
technology was surpassed, like

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.206 A:middle
the floppy disc; remember those,

00:01:46.226 --> 00:01:47.446 A:middle
or the metaphor we're seeing is

00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:48.676 A:middle
too aggressive, like the bomb.

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:52.526 A:middle
Or we had to learn a concept

00:01:52.526 --> 00:01:53.196 A:middle
like the hieroglyph .

00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:55.436 A:middle
Over time the face was removed,

00:01:55.436 --> 00:01:56.586 A:middle
and we've come to notice there's

00:01:56.586 --> 00:01:57.856 A:middle
just the explanation point.

00:01:58.976 --> 00:02:00.586 A:middle
Even smaller glyphs share the

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:01.326 A:middle
same principle.

00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:02.266 A:middle
So, let's take a close look at

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:03.366 A:middle
one of my personal favorites,

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:03.926 A:middle
the paint bucket.

00:02:04.846 --> 00:02:06.416 A:middle
The paint bucket fills your

00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:08.016 A:middle
canvas with color, just like

00:02:08.016 --> 00:02:09.246 A:middle
spilling a real can of paint on

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:09.626 A:middle
the floor.

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:11.596 A:middle
At the time, this was an

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:12.886 A:middle
abstract idea, but it was

00:02:12.886 --> 00:02:14.236 A:middle
grounded here by a real world

00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:14.636 A:middle
object.

00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:17.066 A:middle
And how about how this was drawn

00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:18.826 A:middle
even in those days?

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:20.366 A:middle
Consider the consistency of line

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:20.556 A:middle
weight.

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:22.626 A:middle
There's implied movement in the

00:02:22.626 --> 00:02:25.346 A:middle
angle, a subtle indication of

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:26.046 A:middle
perspective.

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:28.346 A:middle
It's got a good balance of black

00:02:28.346 --> 00:02:28.666 A:middle
and white.

00:02:28.886 --> 00:02:30.276 A:middle
It's simple and high contrast.

00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:32.816 A:middle
These examples represent some

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:34.256 A:middle
fundamental principles that we

00:02:34.256 --> 00:02:35.686 A:middle
still use today when designing

00:02:35.796 --> 00:02:36.316 A:middle
app icons.

00:02:37.196 --> 00:02:39.266 A:middle
The first, metaphor, finding an

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:40.866 A:middle
easily identifiable metaphor

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:43.976 A:middle
that will object or graphic logo

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:44.836 A:middle
a mark.

00:02:45.096 --> 00:02:46.736 A:middle
The second, simplicity; your

00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:47.716 A:middle
design should be simple and

00:02:47.716 --> 00:02:49.076 A:middle
clear, no clutter or over

00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:49.706 A:middle
complicate it.

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:51.356 A:middle
If your icon is designed well,

00:02:51.356 --> 00:02:52.766 A:middle
it should be quick and easy to

00:02:53.976 --> 00:02:54.066 A:middle
read.

00:02:54.286 --> 00:02:54.696 A:middle
Connection.

00:02:55.356 --> 00:02:56.866 A:middle
Aiming to create an emotional

00:02:56.866 --> 00:02:58.536 A:middle
connection with the user, the

00:02:58.536 --> 00:02:59.996 A:middle
icon is the face of your app as

00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:00.686 A:middle
much as the UI.

00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:02.396 A:middle
Keep it fun, keep it engaging.

00:03:02.396 --> 00:03:05.576 A:middle
And lineage, make changes to

00:03:05.576 --> 00:03:07.106 A:middle
your icon meaningful and

00:03:07.106 --> 00:03:07.536 A:middle
deliberate.

00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:09.466 A:middle
Don't change your app icon every

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:10.786 A:middle
single time that you update your

00:03:10.786 --> 00:03:11.006 A:middle
app.

00:03:11.426 --> 00:03:12.786 A:middle
Refine your identity over time.

00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:14.986 A:middle
So, let's think about some of

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.356 A:middle
these principles as they related

00:03:16.356 --> 00:03:17.006 A:middle
to an Apple app.

00:03:18.296 --> 00:03:20.416 A:middle
Keynote. Since version 1, all

00:03:20.416 --> 00:03:22.326 A:middle
the way back in 2003, the app's

00:03:22.326 --> 00:03:23.996 A:middle
identity has been the podium.

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:26.266 A:middle
And why the podium, you ask?

00:03:26.986 --> 00:03:28.356 A:middle
Well, the symbology is

00:03:28.356 --> 00:03:29.726 A:middle
important, especially today of

00:03:29.726 --> 00:03:30.066 A:middle
all days.

00:03:30.656 --> 00:03:32.256 A:middle
It is a real old metaphor that

00:03:32.256 --> 00:03:33.276 A:middle
many can relate to.

00:03:34.106 --> 00:03:35.356 A:middle
Presenters have used podiums for

00:03:35.356 --> 00:03:37.076 A:middle
generations, and to add an

00:03:37.076 --> 00:03:38.106 A:middle
emotional connection, the

00:03:38.106 --> 00:03:39.896 A:middle
presenter notes rest on a warm

00:03:39.896 --> 00:03:40.736 A:middle
wooden surface.

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:42.326 A:middle
The microphone adds a familiar

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:42.716 A:middle
detail.

00:03:43.196 --> 00:03:44.236 A:middle
It immediately sets the stage

00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:46.666 A:middle
for what keynote does, and we

00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:47.716 A:middle
didn't want to lose that.

00:03:47.756 --> 00:03:49.296 A:middle
As keynote has moved from

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:50.896 A:middle
version to version, we updated

00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:51.626 A:middle
the materials, and we've

00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:53.146 A:middle
transitioned from a classic to a

00:03:53.146 --> 00:03:55.406 A:middle
modern style, but the notion of

00:03:55.406 --> 00:03:56.306 A:middle
the podium has remained

00:03:56.306 --> 00:03:56.946 A:middle
consistent.

00:03:57.266 --> 00:03:58.566 A:middle
The lineage provides users with

00:03:58.566 --> 00:03:59.566 A:middle
a sense of familiarity.

00:04:00.346 --> 00:04:01.566 A:middle
The podium was such a strong

00:04:01.566 --> 00:04:02.656 A:middle
mark that when we designed our

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:04.316 A:middle
apps for iOS, we simplified the

00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:06.056 A:middle
podium to more of a glyph and

00:04:06.056 --> 00:04:06.616 A:middle
brought it over.

00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:08.566 A:middle
The visual connection here is

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:09.566 A:middle
really important because it

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:10.846 A:middle
tells users that they can expect

00:04:10.946 --> 00:04:12.096 A:middle
at consistent experience across

00:04:12.096 --> 00:04:12.556 A:middle
platforms.

00:04:13.656 --> 00:04:15.066 A:middle
And if you have a family of

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:16.596 A:middle
apps, take a look at the iLook

00:04:16.596 --> 00:04:17.136 A:middle
icons.

00:04:17.886 --> 00:04:19.986 A:middle
Keynote uses the podium on both

00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:20.906 A:middle
Mac and iOS.

00:04:22.016 --> 00:04:23.936 A:middle
Pages uses the pen, a metaphor

00:04:23.936 --> 00:04:25.176 A:middle
for writing and the written

00:04:25.176 --> 00:04:25.366 A:middle
word.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.576 A:middle
The paper is denoted by a line

00:04:27.576 --> 00:04:28.816 A:middle
on iOS but helps to ground the

00:04:28.816 --> 00:04:30.806 A:middle
pen to a surface.

00:04:30.806 --> 00:04:32.296 A:middle
Numbers uses a flat and more 2D

00:04:32.296 --> 00:04:34.546 A:middle
representation of the chart and

00:04:34.546 --> 00:04:35.986 A:middle
the table on iOS.

00:04:36.946 --> 00:04:38.226 A:middle
We extend the same principles to

00:04:38.226 --> 00:04:40.596 A:middle
GarageBand with, and iMovie with

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:42.376 A:middle
the guitar and the staff.

00:04:42.786 --> 00:04:43.896 A:middle
The metaphor in color palettes

00:04:43.896 --> 00:04:45.006 A:middle
for all of these actually share

00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:46.846 A:middle
the cross platform to reinforce

00:04:46.846 --> 00:04:47.616 A:middle
the idea of family.

00:04:48.736 --> 00:04:50.056 A:middle
Let's focus in on a few details.

00:04:50.286 --> 00:04:51.806 A:middle
Some things are super important.

00:04:52.746 --> 00:04:54.006 A:middle
First off, the colors harmonize

00:04:54.006 --> 00:04:55.206 A:middle
with the rest of iOSs vibrant

00:04:55.206 --> 00:04:56.806 A:middle
color palette.

00:04:57.006 --> 00:04:58.026 A:middle
The glyphs are simple.

00:04:58.536 --> 00:04:59.996 A:middle
They all share the same mass.

00:05:00.026 --> 00:05:01.646 A:middle
They're white and high contrast.

00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:03.026 A:middle
There are no unnecessary

00:05:03.026 --> 00:05:04.856 A:middle
details, and they all share the

00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:05.596 A:middle
same ground plane.

00:05:06.156 --> 00:05:08.026 A:middle
This might just look like the

00:05:08.026 --> 00:05:09.516 A:middle
Keynote podium, but there are

00:05:09.516 --> 00:05:10.626 A:middle
some subtle optimizations

00:05:10.626 --> 00:05:11.236 A:middle
within.

00:05:12.196 --> 00:05:13.396 A:middle
For example, the corners are all

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:14.876 A:middle
custom curves, so they appear

00:05:14.876 --> 00:05:16.336 A:middle
really smooth, a large and small

00:05:16.336 --> 00:05:16.806 A:middle
size.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.236 A:middle
So, again, the same principles,

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:20.446 A:middle
metaphor, simplicity,

00:05:20.736 --> 00:05:21.916 A:middle
connection, lineage.

00:05:22.936 --> 00:05:23.606 A:middle
Let's look at these as they

00:05:23.606 --> 00:05:24.856 A:middle
relate to another app, music

00:05:24.856 --> 00:05:26.136 A:middle
memo, shown here on the right.

00:05:26.736 --> 00:05:27.596 A:middle
There's a clear connection to

00:05:27.596 --> 00:05:28.946 A:middle
the history of GarageBand

00:05:29.076 --> 00:05:30.226 A:middle
through color and metaphor.

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:31.686 A:middle
The circle is reminiscent of a

00:05:31.686 --> 00:05:33.036 A:middle
sound hole in an acoustic

00:05:33.036 --> 00:05:33.396 A:middle
guitar.

00:05:34.216 --> 00:05:35.726 A:middle
The strings vibrate in a playful

00:05:35.726 --> 00:05:36.276 A:middle
graphic way.

00:05:36.276 --> 00:05:37.616 A:middle
There's a sense of movement and

00:05:37.616 --> 00:05:38.346 A:middle
creativity.

00:05:39.386 --> 00:05:40.966 A:middle
The icon makes use of the iOS

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:42.526 A:middle
icon grid so that when music

00:05:42.526 --> 00:05:43.736 A:middle
memos appears next to other

00:05:43.736 --> 00:05:45.666 A:middle
icons in the system, the common

00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:47.066 A:middle
elements like the circle are the

00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:48.376 A:middle
same size as say Safari.

00:05:48.376 --> 00:05:50.746 A:middle
Now, we're going to do something

00:05:50.746 --> 00:05:51.776 A:middle
a little fun.

00:05:51.776 --> 00:05:52.726 A:middle
We're going to take a look at

00:05:52.726 --> 00:05:53.916 A:middle
the News app icon to look at

00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:55.226 A:middle
some of the more practical

00:05:55.226 --> 00:05:56.556 A:middle
considerations to think of when

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:57.966 A:middle
you design your app icon and

00:05:57.966 --> 00:05:59.236 A:middle
some tests that you can do at

00:05:59.236 --> 00:06:00.366 A:middle
home to make sure that your

00:06:00.366 --> 00:06:01.526 A:middle
design is holding up at a

00:06:01.526 --> 00:06:02.226 A:middle
smaller size.

00:06:02.516 --> 00:06:05.646 A:middle
So, let's ask ourselves a

00:06:05.646 --> 00:06:07.986 A:middle
question, in a hypothetical

00:06:07.986 --> 00:06:10.676 A:middle
world, what if News were the

00:06:10.676 --> 00:06:12.206 A:middle
only app on the home screen?

00:06:13.436 --> 00:06:14.666 A:middle
What would the icon have to

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:15.666 A:middle
communicate for it to be

00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:16.956 A:middle
immediately clear that News does

00:06:16.956 --> 00:06:18.076 A:middle
what News actually does?

00:06:18.936 --> 00:06:20.256 A:middle
Or to be understood without a

00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:21.436 A:middle
name underneath the icon?

00:06:22.456 --> 00:06:23.346 A:middle
How would a good use of

00:06:23.346 --> 00:06:25.306 A:middle
simplicity, form, color,

00:06:25.566 --> 00:06:27.646 A:middle
contrast, composition help it to

00:06:27.646 --> 00:06:28.196 A:middle
be understood?

00:06:28.466 --> 00:06:29.456 A:middle
You think an icon would have to

00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:30.356 A:middle
work twice as hard, right?

00:06:31.476 --> 00:06:32.606 A:middle
Well, here's a few other props

00:06:32.606 --> 00:06:33.566 A:middle
that we tried along the way.

00:06:34.336 --> 00:06:36.136 A:middle
The first icon here has a peak

00:06:36.136 --> 00:06:37.766 A:middle
of paper is a little abstract.

00:06:38.276 --> 00:06:39.116 A:middle
Does the end rest on a

00:06:39.116 --> 00:06:40.396 A:middle
newspaper, or a white box?

00:06:40.396 --> 00:06:41.846 A:middle
A little hard to tell, and much

00:06:41.846 --> 00:06:43.116 A:middle
of the red background is hidden.

00:06:43.996 --> 00:06:45.356 A:middle
The second introduces another

00:06:45.356 --> 00:06:46.326 A:middle
sheet behind the first, which

00:06:46.326 --> 00:06:47.836 A:middle
helps to reinforce the metaphor

00:06:47.836 --> 00:06:49.406 A:middle
a little, but when the other

00:06:49.406 --> 00:06:50.406 A:middle
edges are missing, you can't

00:06:50.406 --> 00:06:51.376 A:middle
tell that the N is actually

00:06:51.376 --> 00:06:52.776 A:middle
resting on a newspaper, and the

00:06:52.776 --> 00:06:54.116 A:middle
color is still fairly hidden.

00:06:55.116 --> 00:06:56.246 A:middle
Let's look at the third design.

00:06:56.866 --> 00:06:57.926 A:middle
You can clearly see all the

00:06:57.926 --> 00:06:58.726 A:middle
edges on the newspaper.

00:06:59.066 --> 00:07:00.596 A:middle
The white is high contrast; the

00:07:00.596 --> 00:07:01.756 A:middle
red background pops.

00:07:02.016 --> 00:07:03.216 A:middle
The rendering of the newspaper

00:07:03.726 --> 00:07:05.626 A:middle
and logo text is simple, bold,

00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:06.096 A:middle
and graphic.

00:07:06.946 --> 00:07:07.456 A:middle
Why does this matter?

00:07:08.786 --> 00:07:09.966 A:middle
Well, when you look at your icon

00:07:09.966 --> 00:07:10.876 A:middle
on the Home screen, you can

00:07:10.876 --> 00:07:11.836 A:middle
really see what holds up at a

00:07:11.836 --> 00:07:13.396 A:middle
small size and is the right mix

00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:15.276 A:middle
for contrast form and color.

00:07:15.466 --> 00:07:16.276 A:middle
Here's the three designs at a

00:07:16.276 --> 00:07:16.826 A:middle
small size.

00:07:17.866 --> 00:07:19.816 A:middle
And try testing your icon in a

00:07:19.816 --> 00:07:21.516 A:middle
folder next to other icons.

00:07:21.786 --> 00:07:22.406 A:middle
Squint your eyes.

00:07:23.166 --> 00:07:23.926 A:middle
Where's the news article?

00:07:25.336 --> 00:07:26.096 A:middle
Right there on the top left.

00:07:26.436 --> 00:07:28.176 A:middle
And it's easy to see because of

00:07:28.176 --> 00:07:28.996 A:middle
the simple design.

00:07:28.996 --> 00:07:30.176 A:middle
The composition is distinct.

00:07:30.176 --> 00:07:31.446 A:middle
It's high contrast, and the

00:07:31.446 --> 00:07:33.706 A:middle
color is clearly visible.

00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:36.166 A:middle
Designing an app icon is an

00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:37.176 A:middle
iterative process.

00:07:37.586 --> 00:07:38.316 A:middle
So, here's some other things

00:07:38.316 --> 00:07:39.046 A:middle
that you could think about as

00:07:39.046 --> 00:07:40.066 A:middle
you start to design yours.

00:07:40.976 --> 00:07:42.076 A:middle
We'll start with the first,

00:07:42.076 --> 00:07:43.316 A:middle
trying to be unique.

00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:45.426 A:middle
Now, that might sound like a

00:07:45.426 --> 00:07:47.086 A:middle
tall order, but it's important

00:07:47.086 --> 00:07:48.156 A:middle
to be really aware of other apps

00:07:48.156 --> 00:07:48.736 A:middle
in your category.

00:07:49.516 --> 00:07:50.306 A:middle
Here's the three apps in the

00:07:50.306 --> 00:07:52.706 A:middle
video space, Quick, Instagram,

00:07:52.856 --> 00:07:53.236 A:middle
Periscope.

00:07:54.136 --> 00:07:55.426 A:middle
Let's look at how different

00:07:55.426 --> 00:07:56.176 A:middle
these icons are.

00:07:56.406 --> 00:07:57.776 A:middle
Colors and shapes are bold.

00:07:58.336 --> 00:07:59.676 A:middle
Each is distinct; it stands out

00:07:59.676 --> 00:08:00.236 A:middle
on the Home screen.

00:08:01.176 --> 00:08:02.586 A:middle
Instagram is also a great

00:08:02.586 --> 00:08:03.746 A:middle
example of how an icon can

00:08:03.746 --> 00:08:05.296 A:middle
become synonymous with a company

00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:06.276 A:middle
the moment you see the white

00:08:06.276 --> 00:08:07.596 A:middle
camera glyph, the purple sky,

00:08:07.866 --> 00:08:10.976 A:middle
you immediately think Instagram.

00:08:10.976 --> 00:08:12.246 A:middle
Second, experiment.

00:08:14.056 --> 00:08:15.476 A:middle
Now, despite how beautiful a

00:08:15.476 --> 00:08:16.836 A:middle
blank canvas is, starting here

00:08:16.836 --> 00:08:18.156 A:middle
might be a little daunting.

00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:20.566 A:middle
So, why not try a little bit of

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:20.786 A:middle
sketching.

00:08:21.146 --> 00:08:22.616 A:middle
Even if you don't think you can

00:08:22.656 --> 00:08:24.346 A:middle
raw, sometimes a pen and paper

00:08:24.346 --> 00:08:25.756 A:middle
goes way further than a mouse,

00:08:26.156 --> 00:08:27.356 A:middle
and sketching is a great way to

00:08:27.356 --> 00:08:28.386 A:middle
get your ideas out without

00:08:28.386 --> 00:08:29.496 A:middle
worrying about finessing your

00:08:29.496 --> 00:08:30.216 A:middle
icon early on.

00:08:30.966 --> 00:08:32.326 A:middle
Do some doodles; show your

00:08:32.356 --> 00:08:33.586 A:middle
friends; get their ideas.

00:08:33.586 --> 00:08:35.446 A:middle
This is your app icon, so your

00:08:35.446 --> 00:08:36.286 A:middle
design has to pop.

00:08:36.356 --> 00:08:37.256 A:middle
Have some fun with it.

00:08:38.516 --> 00:08:40.456 A:middle
Further, and perhaps most

00:08:40.456 --> 00:08:42.346 A:middle
important, test.

00:08:43.376 --> 00:08:44.296 A:middle
What do we mean by test?

00:08:45.536 --> 00:08:46.456 A:middle
Well, as you develop your app

00:08:46.456 --> 00:08:47.526 A:middle
icon, examine on the Home

00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:49.446 A:middle
screen, in a folder, and if your

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:50.546 A:middle
app has settings, the settings

00:08:50.546 --> 00:08:50.646 A:middle
app.

00:08:52.016 --> 00:08:53.516 A:middle
And be careful if you decide to

00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:54.796 A:middle
represent your user interface in

00:08:54.796 --> 00:08:55.276 A:middle
your icon.

00:08:55.946 --> 00:08:57.316 A:middle
Clear is a great example of

00:08:57.316 --> 00:08:59.136 A:middle
doing this really, really well.

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:00.976 A:middle
They've got a strong visual

00:09:00.976 --> 00:09:02.806 A:middle
style with recognizable colors

00:09:03.016 --> 00:09:04.516 A:middle
and a simple brand of pattern

00:09:04.986 --> 00:09:06.186 A:middle
that really helps to stand out

00:09:06.186 --> 00:09:06.996 A:middle
at a small size.

00:09:07.066 --> 00:09:08.306 A:middle
Again, it's simple, colorful,

00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:09.346 A:middle
high contrast.

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.636 A:middle
And last but not least, have

00:09:12.636 --> 00:09:13.236 A:middle
some patience.

00:09:13.966 --> 00:09:14.936 A:middle
The answer might not come to you

00:09:14.936 --> 00:09:15.366 A:middle
right away.

00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:17.286 A:middle
Take your time, examine your

00:09:17.286 --> 00:09:19.186 A:middle
options, and save your work.

00:09:19.606 --> 00:09:21.096 A:middle
Oftentimes, it's the simplest

00:09:21.096 --> 00:09:22.916 A:middle
design or an early direction

00:09:22.916 --> 00:09:23.806 A:middle
that you abandoned that you

00:09:23.806 --> 00:09:24.926 A:middle
actually ultimately find is the

00:09:24.926 --> 00:09:25.476 A:middle
right choice.

00:09:26.026 --> 00:09:29.206 A:middle
So, to summarize, when designing

00:09:29.206 --> 00:09:30.516 A:middle
your app icon, think about

00:09:31.726 --> 00:09:34.046 A:middle
metaphor, a clearly identifiable

00:09:34.046 --> 00:09:37.006 A:middle
object or symbol that is simple

00:09:37.006 --> 00:09:38.026 A:middle
and easy to understand.

00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:40.176 A:middle
To create an emotional

00:09:40.176 --> 00:09:41.516 A:middle
connection with the user, be

00:09:41.596 --> 00:09:42.416 A:middle
fun, be playful.

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.286 A:middle
And lineage, your icon is the

00:09:45.286 --> 00:09:46.226 A:middle
face of your app.

00:09:46.866 --> 00:09:47.496 A:middle
It's our brand.

00:09:47.566 --> 00:09:48.556 A:middle
Think of your icon as an

00:09:48.556 --> 00:09:49.106 A:middle
investment.

00:09:49.846 --> 00:09:52.306 A:middle
And for the process, try to make

00:09:52.306 --> 00:09:53.846 A:middle
your icon unique so it stands

00:09:53.846 --> 00:09:55.256 A:middle
out on the Home screen and the

00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:55.666 A:middle
App Store.

00:09:56.456 --> 00:09:57.476 A:middle
Experiment with different

00:09:57.476 --> 00:09:59.416 A:middle
designs and test them.

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:00.876 A:middle
Use the icon grid.

00:10:01.176 --> 00:10:02.886 A:middle
Look at icons that Apple has

00:10:02.886 --> 00:10:04.366 A:middle
designed as reference for form

00:10:04.366 --> 00:10:04.756 A:middle
and color.

00:10:05.326 --> 00:10:06.576 A:middle
See what looks good, big and

00:10:06.576 --> 00:10:06.876 A:middle
small.

00:10:07.536 --> 00:10:08.886 A:middle
Put your icon in a folder to see

00:10:08.886 --> 00:10:09.836 A:middle
how it looks at a really small

00:10:09.836 --> 00:10:10.316 A:middle
size.

00:10:10.926 --> 00:10:12.436 A:middle
And don't forget to optimize

00:10:12.436 --> 00:10:13.416 A:middle
your assets for different device

00:10:13.416 --> 00:10:13.836 A:middle
sizes.

00:10:14.806 --> 00:10:16.426 A:middle
And above all, have patience.

00:10:16.886 --> 00:10:18.246 A:middle
Designing an app icon can seem

00:10:18.246 --> 00:10:19.616 A:middle
like a lot of work, but if you

00:10:19.616 --> 00:10:20.646 A:middle
invest the time to do it, it can

00:10:20.646 --> 00:10:21.396 A:middle
really, really pay off.

00:10:21.396 --> 00:10:21.976 A:middle
Thanks for your time.
