&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:26.976 A:middle
My name is Felice

00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:29.516 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:29.516 --> 00:00:30.376 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.056 A:middle
I'm glad to see you all here and

00:00:34.056 --> 00:00:35.816 A:middle
I'm very pleased to welcome you

00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:37.696 A:middle
to today's lunchtime session,

00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:39.656 A:middle
Convenience for You is

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:40.716 A:middle
Independence for Me.

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:43.026 A:middle
So, hope some of you were able,

00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:44.216 A:middle
or many of you were able to

00:00:44.216 --> 00:00:45.786 A:middle
attend yesterday's session with

00:00:45.786 --> 00:00:48.076 A:middle

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.816 A:middle
I'm glad you enjoyed that.

00:00:53.816 --> 00:00:55.736 A:middle
So, I have to prepare you hold

00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:56.686 A:middle
onto your seats.

00:00:57.346 --> 00:00:59.426 A:middle
Today's speaker is incredible.

00:01:00.036 --> 00:01:02.756 A:middle
Todd Stabelfeldt was injured at

00:01:02.756 --> 00:01:04.576 A:middle
an early age in an accident that

00:01:04.576 --> 00:01:05.656 A:middle
left him paralyzed.

00:01:06.786 --> 00:01:08.016 A:middle
Some might have considered that

00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:10.706 A:middle
an insurmountable obstacle.

00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:13.046 A:middle
Not so with Todd.

00:01:14.376 --> 00:01:17.756 A:middle
He is simply a force into

00:01:17.756 --> 00:01:18.216 A:middle
himself.

00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:23.456 A:middle
So, I found personally from

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:25.336 A:middle
working with him, that to know

00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:26.066 A:middle
him is to love him.

00:01:26.606 --> 00:01:29.396 A:middle
And I'm the only thing standing

00:01:29.396 --> 00:01:31.196 A:middle
in the way of you getting to

00:01:31.196 --> 00:01:31.706 A:middle
know Todd.

00:01:32.406 --> 00:01:34.296 A:middle
So please, it is my privilege to

00:01:34.296 --> 00:01:35.806 A:middle
introduce to you Todd

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:36.476 A:middle

00:01:58.126 --> 00:02:00.386 A:middle
see my big harry face.

00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:02.866 A:middle
And a bunch of dudes with

00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:04.246 A:middle
enormous muscles.

00:02:04.736 --> 00:02:06.096 A:middle
And I'm going to assume those

00:02:06.096 --> 00:02:06.756 A:middle
are quads.

00:02:07.086 --> 00:02:08.946 A:middle
I have no idea how muscles even

00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:12.166 A:middle
work, OK?

00:02:12.756 --> 00:02:14.046 A:middle
So, yeah I'm Todd.

00:02:15.376 --> 00:02:16.676 A:middle
Back in the day, back in

00:02:16.676 --> 00:02:17.776 A:middle
kindergarten days it was

00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:19.876 A:middle
Stabelface, but we promoted to

00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:20.646 A:middle
Stabelfeldt.

00:02:20.646 --> 00:02:23.936 A:middle
So, that's how we call it.

00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:25.316 A:middle
What am I doing, right?

00:02:25.316 --> 00:02:28.316 A:middle
This is a moment, this is a

00:02:28.316 --> 00:02:30.246 A:middle
bucketlist moment for a dude.

Especially a nerd.

You know, I've years dreams

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:38.606 A:middle
wouldn't that be radical to go

00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:39.606 A:middle
to WWDC.

00:02:39.936 --> 00:02:41.826 A:middle
Now, I'm actually here.

00:02:42.376 --> 00:02:44.776 A:middle
So, I will, oh, thank, you.

care if I suck or not, this is

00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:55.656 A:middle

00:03:01.156 --> 00:03:02.766 A:middle
OK. All right.

00:03:04.776 --> 00:03:06.426 A:middle
Let's do this.

00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:10.276 A:middle
I want you to see me.

I really, really want you to see

and suffering.

Deal with it, handle it.

00:04:00.956 --> 00:04:01.816 A:middle
So, I'm going to walk you

00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:02.866 A:middle
through a couple of videos.

00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:04.106 A:middle
No pun intended on that walk

00:04:04.106 --> 00:04:04.446 A:middle
part.

You can laugh, go ahead.

00:04:05.586 --> 00:04:07.616 A:middle
How dare you laugh, that's

00:04:07.616 --> 00:04:08.496 A:middle
horribly offensive [laughter].

00:04:10.206 --> 00:04:10.856 A:middle
All right.

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:12.266 A:middle

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:19.736 A:middle
All right whatever you get it.

00:04:19.856 --> 00:04:20.966 A:middle
We'll stop there.

00:04:21.426 --> 00:04:22.936 A:middle
The jokes begin to fall apart

00:04:22.936 --> 00:04:23.516 A:middle
after that.

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:26.876 A:middle
I'm going to go ahead and show a

00:04:26.876 --> 00:04:27.966 A:middle
couple of videos today, and

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:29.046 A:middle
we're going to talk a little

00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:30.546 A:middle
bit, and then we're going to do

00:04:30.546 --> 00:04:32.346 A:middle
actually a live demo.

00:04:32.346 --> 00:04:33.386 A:middle
And that's what we're going to

00:04:33.386 --> 00:04:33.546 A:middle
do.

00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:35.096 A:middle
So, as I sort of kick up this

00:04:35.096 --> 00:04:37.016 A:middle
next video, I'm just sort of,

00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:38.236 A:middle
let's sort of see some of the

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.566 A:middle
older stuff and get a sense of

00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:41.726 A:middle
where we're at today, OK?

00:04:41.786 --> 00:04:43.246 A:middle
So, we're going to take a few

00:04:43.246 --> 00:04:44.156 A:middle
minutes and watch this first

00:04:44.156 --> 00:04:44.506 A:middle
vid.

00:05:00.076 --> 00:05:01.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Todd Stabelfeldt.

00:05:01.656 --> 00:05:04.266 A:middle
I was paralyzed in 1987 due to a

00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:04.906 A:middle
gunshot wound.

00:05:04.906 --> 00:05:06.326 A:middle
My cousin and I were playing

00:05:06.326 --> 00:05:07.286 A:middle
with some guns, and

00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:09.006 A:middle
unfortunately, that resulted in

00:05:09.006 --> 00:05:10.236 A:middle
what's called C4 quadriplegia.

00:05:10.236 --> 00:05:12.156 A:middle
I'm able to move from my

00:05:12.156 --> 00:05:14.036 A:middle
shoulders up, and from the

00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:15.246 A:middle
shoulders down is essentially

00:05:15.246 --> 00:05:16.306 A:middle
gone.

00:05:16.306 --> 00:05:17.926 A:middle
Once you're paralyzed, you're

00:05:17.926 --> 00:05:19.226 A:middle
almost sort of reborn.

00:05:19.226 --> 00:05:21.286 A:middle
And you start all over again.

00:05:21.286 --> 00:05:22.346 A:middle
Because now you can't do

00:05:22.346 --> 00:05:23.156 A:middle
anything for yourself.

00:05:23.476 --> 00:05:24.876 A:middle
I learned quickly as a young

00:05:24.876 --> 00:05:26.456 A:middle
kid, what my life was going to

00:05:26.456 --> 00:05:28.046 A:middle
be all about, putting solutions

00:05:28.046 --> 00:05:28.796 A:middle
together.

00:05:28.796 --> 00:05:30.526 A:middle
Back then, it was really, really

00:05:30.526 --> 00:05:32.796 A:middle
crude approaches to just try to

00:05:32.796 --> 00:05:34.636 A:middle
have any shred of independence.

00:05:34.636 --> 00:05:36.126 A:middle
And one of the real systemic

00:05:36.126 --> 00:05:37.426 A:middle
problems was communication,

00:05:37.726 --> 00:05:38.496 A:middle
especially at that sort of

00:05:38.496 --> 00:05:39.326 A:middle
mobile level.

00:05:39.326 --> 00:05:41.016 A:middle
You know, with a spinal cord

00:05:41.016 --> 00:05:42.466 A:middle
injury, essentially we are

00:05:42.466 --> 00:05:43.726 A:middle
reduced to our voice.

00:05:43.856 --> 00:05:45.866 A:middle
Voice recognition has come a

00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:46.346 A:middle
long way.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.426 A:middle
It's been amazing.

00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:48.276 A:middle
It's been awesome.

00:05:48.276 --> 00:05:51.186 A:middle
The one piece that was always

00:05:51.186 --> 00:05:53.096 A:middle
missing, you had to press a

00:05:53.096 --> 00:05:55.246 A:middle
button to start.

00:05:55.246 --> 00:05:56.626 A:middle
You had to press a button to

00:05:56.816 --> 00:05:57.606 A:middle
engage.

00:05:57.786 --> 00:05:59.176 A:middle
So, something that was so

00:05:59.176 --> 00:06:01.086 A:middle
amazing, and always so close and

00:06:01.086 --> 00:06:02.346 A:middle
oh, you could taste it.

00:06:02.386 --> 00:06:04.916 A:middle
To me was never going to be a

00:06:04.916 --> 00:06:06.776 A:middle
reality, because I can't put the

00:06:07.026 --> 00:06:08.976 A:middle
button.

00:06:09.146 --> 00:06:11.236 A:middle
And then, something fascinating

00:06:11.236 --> 00:06:11.546 A:middle
occurred.

00:06:11.546 --> 00:06:13.506 A:middle
iOS 7 was released.

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.126 A:middle
And in that operating system,

00:06:15.126 --> 00:06:17.736 A:middle
came this concept and reality

00:06:17.736 --> 00:06:18.766 A:middle
that says, hey you know what,

00:06:18.766 --> 00:06:20.296 A:middle
you don't have to put this

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:20.666 A:middle
button.

00:06:20.666 --> 00:06:21.656 A:middle
How about you push your button.

00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:23.646 A:middle
Whatever the configuration that

00:06:23.646 --> 00:06:26.426 A:middle
your story is, we are adapting

00:06:26.426 --> 00:06:28.286 A:middle
our operating system around you.

00:06:28.286 --> 00:06:30.416 A:middle
For me, communication is a big

00:06:30.486 --> 00:06:31.586 A:middle
deal.

00:06:31.586 --> 00:06:34.196 A:middle
Being intendent is a big deal.

00:06:34.526 --> 00:06:36.356 A:middle
And when I worked with Siri for

00:06:36.356 --> 00:06:37.936 A:middle
the first time, to interact with

00:06:37.936 --> 00:06:38.966 A:middle
her and understand how she

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:40.616 A:middle
works, and to create a calendar

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:43.276 A:middle
appointment with a colleague and

00:06:43.276 --> 00:06:44.586 A:middle
then check my computer to make

00:06:44.586 --> 00:06:46.016 A:middle
sure it was real.

00:06:46.016 --> 00:06:47.276 A:middle
I was blown away.

00:06:47.276 --> 00:06:49.706 A:middle
I mean, Apple is now touching

00:06:49.706 --> 00:06:51.736 A:middle
people at this human experience

00:06:51.736 --> 00:06:52.706 A:middle
level.

00:06:52.706 --> 00:06:54.586 A:middle
To be a part of texting my wife

00:06:54.696 --> 00:06:56.186 A:middle
without somebody else doing it.

00:06:56.186 --> 00:06:59.136 A:middle
Words, in this current language

00:06:59.206 --> 00:07:00.936 A:middle
do not even identify that

00:07:00.936 --> 00:07:01.576 A:middle
feeling.

[ Applause ]

00:07:10.306 --> 00:07:14.136 A:middle

00:07:14.776 --> 00:07:15.836 A:middle
film to create.

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:17.686 A:middle
And a wonderful film to create.

00:07:18.766 --> 00:07:20.376 A:middle
And my buddy Mark McNight and I

00:07:20.376 --> 00:07:20.936 A:middle
did that.

00:07:22.046 --> 00:07:23.576 A:middle
It was a couple years back now.

00:07:24.536 --> 00:07:25.586 A:middle
But let me tell you real quick,

00:07:25.586 --> 00:07:27.276 A:middle
how I sort of got to that video.

00:07:28.056 --> 00:07:29.216 A:middle
Because that's where it sort of

00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:32.126 A:middle
explains sort of the situation.

00:07:32.656 --> 00:07:36.216 A:middle
So, I was born, now it seems

00:07:36.216 --> 00:07:37.506 A:middle
weird to say, a long time ago.

00:07:38.506 --> 00:07:39.796 A:middle
Back in the seventies, can you

00:07:39.796 --> 00:07:40.596 A:middle
believe it?

00:07:40.596 --> 00:07:43.686 A:middle
And mom, dad, sister normal

00:07:43.686 --> 00:07:44.166 A:middle
routine.

00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:47.196 A:middle
Grew up in a very Navy, very

00:07:47.196 --> 00:07:48.696 A:middle
southern, and very German

00:07:48.696 --> 00:07:51.216 A:middle
household; the trifecta.

00:07:52.906 --> 00:07:54.186 A:middle
Failure wasn't an option.

00:07:55.616 --> 00:07:56.886 A:middle
Everybody was valuable.

00:07:58.256 --> 00:08:00.706 A:middle
Everybody was responsible for

00:08:00.706 --> 00:08:03.506 A:middle
putting groceries on the table.

00:08:03.596 --> 00:08:05.066 A:middle
And you always told the truth.

00:08:05.546 --> 00:08:07.576 A:middle
That's the way I was brought.

00:08:07.746 --> 00:08:08.636 A:middle
That's the way I was raised.

00:08:09.806 --> 00:08:10.966 A:middle
Four years into my story,

00:08:10.966 --> 00:08:12.146 A:middle
unfortunately my dad died in a

00:08:12.146 --> 00:08:14.846 A:middle
horrific motorcycle accident.

00:08:16.216 --> 00:08:17.636 A:middle
Four years later, now in it's in

00:08:17.636 --> 00:08:19.286 A:middle
the eighties, mom decides to

00:08:19.596 --> 00:08:20.706 A:middle
remodel her bedroom.

00:08:20.816 --> 00:08:22.176 A:middle
She puts all these old antique

00:08:22.526 --> 00:08:23.976 A:middle
guns and bullets into a spare

00:08:23.976 --> 00:08:24.436 A:middle
room.

00:08:24.436 --> 00:08:26.516 A:middle
It was the eighties.

00:08:26.516 --> 00:08:27.016 A:middle
Come on man.

00:08:27.016 --> 00:08:28.576 A:middle
We had Bruce Willis Nakatomi

00:08:28.576 --> 00:08:29.096 A:middle
Building.

00:08:29.096 --> 00:08:30.826 A:middle
We've got little baby Sylvester

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:31.716 A:middle
doing his thing.

00:08:31.966 --> 00:08:33.936 A:middle
And we had Commando, right.

00:08:33.936 --> 00:08:35.716 A:middle
WW 3 wasn't anywhere around the

00:08:36.246 --> 00:08:36.556 A:middle
corner.

00:08:36.556 --> 00:08:37.626 A:middle
Chewed my graham crackers into a

00:08:37.626 --> 00:08:38.016 A:middle
gun.

00:08:38.116 --> 00:08:39.896 A:middle
This is what we did back then.

00:08:41.176 --> 00:08:42.466 A:middle
So, sadly without knowing

00:08:42.466 --> 00:08:43.496 A:middle
anything really about guns and

00:08:43.496 --> 00:08:44.496 A:middle
how they worked, I got shot.

00:08:45.016 --> 00:08:46.946 A:middle
And that was at 8 years old.

00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:49.756 A:middle
Fast forward a bit more, when I

00:08:50.206 --> 00:08:52.346 A:middle
was a teenager, my mom got

00:08:52.346 --> 00:08:52.856 A:middle
remarried.

00:08:52.856 --> 00:08:55.196 A:middle
And in that process I got a dad.

00:08:56.226 --> 00:08:57.346 A:middle
Dan Alberts.

00:08:57.346 --> 00:09:00.176 A:middle
I got a dad.

00:09:03.326 --> 00:09:04.516 A:middle
And also in that acquisition of

00:09:04.516 --> 00:09:05.496 A:middle
marriage I got two brothers and

00:09:05.496 --> 00:09:05.886 A:middle
a sister.

00:09:06.426 --> 00:09:07.996 A:middle
That was cool.

00:09:07.996 --> 00:09:09.136 A:middle
I'm good with that, they call me

00:09:09.136 --> 00:09:10.976 A:middle
the baby, the broken baby.

00:09:11.916 --> 00:09:12.716 A:middle
That's what I was with the

00:09:12.716 --> 00:09:13.326 A:middle
siblings.

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:18.896 A:middle
And about that time, it was like

00:09:18.896 --> 00:09:20.796 A:middle
well, what are you going to do?

00:09:20.796 --> 00:09:22.396 A:middle
My mom made it very clear, you

00:09:23.426 --> 00:09:24.776 A:middle
have until the age of 20.

00:09:24.776 --> 00:09:27.306 A:middle
You have to be out of the house.

00:09:27.306 --> 00:09:29.316 A:middle
She was going to give me two

00:09:29.316 --> 00:09:30.206 A:middle
years of the grace.

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:31.476 A:middle
She called it tough love.

00:09:31.596 --> 00:09:33.346 A:middle
I either needed to be in

00:09:33.346 --> 00:09:35.016 A:middle
college, or I needed to have a

00:09:35.016 --> 00:09:37.866 A:middle
job, but that she didn't shoot

00:09:37.866 --> 00:09:38.076 A:middle
me.

00:09:39.726 --> 00:09:40.876 A:middle
I got shot.

00:09:40.876 --> 00:09:43.706 A:middle
Some might say today that might

00:09:43.756 --> 00:09:46.136 A:middle
be a little weird and tough.

00:09:46.736 --> 00:09:47.656 A:middle
But it was tough love.

00:09:48.236 --> 00:09:49.776 A:middle
And it was yes ma'am, no ma'am.

00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:52.666 A:middle
And I thought, well what am I

00:09:52.666 --> 00:09:53.436 A:middle
going to do.

00:09:53.496 --> 00:09:55.636 A:middle
I always wanted to be a Navy

00:09:55.636 --> 00:09:56.106 A:middle
Seal.

00:09:56.256 --> 00:09:57.336 A:middle
I wanted to be in the Secret

00:09:57.336 --> 00:09:57.916 A:middle
Service.

00:09:58.956 --> 00:09:59.716 A:middle
That was the plan.

00:10:01.126 --> 00:10:02.686 A:middle
And then my body got robbed.

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:05.216 A:middle
So, what became the plan, well

00:10:05.216 --> 00:10:06.656 A:middle
I'll become a psychiatrist.

00:10:07.196 --> 00:10:08.616 A:middle
I wanted to go to med school.

00:10:08.616 --> 00:10:09.726 A:middle
I wanted to go to Berkeley.

00:10:09.946 --> 00:10:14.406 A:middle
And about that 15, 16 years of

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:16.596 A:middle
age, parents sat me down, dad

00:10:16.596 --> 00:10:18.716 A:middle
and mom and said, hey, what are

00:10:18.716 --> 00:10:19.586 A:middle
you going to do.

00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:21.366 A:middle
What if something like med

00:10:21.366 --> 00:10:22.476 A:middle
school doesn't really work?

00:10:23.006 --> 00:10:24.496 A:middle
I said, OK.

00:10:24.496 --> 00:10:27.026 A:middle
You've got to have a marketable

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:27.756 A:middle
skill son.

00:10:27.756 --> 00:10:30.766 A:middle
And I thought, well I'm not sure

00:10:30.766 --> 00:10:31.476 A:middle
what I'm going to do.

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:34.116 A:middle
So, in that process of just sort

00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:35.466 A:middle
of being open and learning,

00:10:36.106 --> 00:10:37.196 A:middle
there was this thing called the

00:10:37.196 --> 00:10:37.806 A:middle
internet.

00:10:37.806 --> 00:10:40.576 A:middle
This was the mid-nineties.

00:10:40.646 --> 00:10:42.576 A:middle
And there was just over 100,000

00:10:42.576 --> 00:10:43.316 A:middle
websites.

00:10:43.826 --> 00:10:46.326 A:middle
And I begin to go to school

00:10:46.986 --> 00:10:48.486 A:middle
outside of my normal high school

00:10:48.486 --> 00:10:49.016 A:middle
process.

00:10:49.016 --> 00:10:50.216 A:middle
Actually, had to move away,

00:10:50.696 --> 00:10:52.596 A:middle
about 2.5 hours away from my

00:10:52.596 --> 00:10:53.106 A:middle
parents.

00:10:53.886 --> 00:10:55.806 A:middle
I had to become emancipated from

00:10:55.806 --> 00:10:57.876 A:middle
my parents as well, just because

00:10:57.876 --> 00:10:58.946 A:middle
the way some of these rules

00:10:58.946 --> 00:10:59.266 A:middle
work.

00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:02.156 A:middle
And I began to go to college and

00:11:02.156 --> 00:11:03.486 A:middle
high school at the same time.

00:11:04.056 --> 00:11:06.556 A:middle
And at the age of 17 years old,

00:11:06.556 --> 00:11:07.866 A:middle
I was done with my associates,

00:11:08.356 --> 00:11:10.826 A:middle
learned software development,

00:11:11.236 --> 00:11:12.026 A:middle
specifically in the

00:11:12.026 --> 00:11:13.286 A:middle
client/server platform

00:11:13.286 --> 00:11:13.926 A:middle
relationship.

00:11:14.476 --> 00:11:17.276 A:middle
And after that it was, well, but

00:11:18.346 --> 00:11:19.226 A:middle
I want to go to Berkeley.

00:11:21.326 --> 00:11:22.736 A:middle
Well, just go get your GED and

00:11:22.736 --> 00:11:24.616 A:middle
then maybe you can make it

00:11:24.616 --> 00:11:25.226 A:middle
happen for you.

00:11:26.066 --> 00:11:28.076 A:middle
Berkeley's not going to accept a

00:11:28.076 --> 00:11:28.206 A:middle
GED.

00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:30.696 A:middle
Well, you got to get a diploma.

00:11:31.696 --> 00:11:34.556 A:middle
I got to go back to high school?

00:11:34.556 --> 00:11:36.306 A:middle
So, I ended up actually doing

00:11:36.306 --> 00:11:36.426 A:middle
that.

00:11:36.426 --> 00:11:37.076 A:middle
I don't even know the high

00:11:37.076 --> 00:11:38.266 A:middle
school I graduated from.

00:11:38.266 --> 00:11:40.156 A:middle
I know its location Renton,

00:11:40.156 --> 00:11:40.746 A:middle
Washington.

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:42.346 A:middle
But I actually never stepped

00:11:42.346 --> 00:11:43.066 A:middle
foot in that school.

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:45.826 A:middle
So, I graduated high school

00:11:45.826 --> 00:11:46.776 A:middle
actually after I graduated

00:11:46.776 --> 00:11:47.256 A:middle
college.

00:11:48.326 --> 00:11:50.686 A:middle
Exactly. Completely jacked up,

00:11:50.686 --> 00:11:51.016 A:middle
right.

00:11:51.166 --> 00:11:53.846 A:middle
My degree wasn't even valid

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:57.656 A:middle
until high school was over with.

00:11:57.806 --> 00:12:01.486 A:middle
So, I did that and during that

00:12:01.486 --> 00:12:03.306 A:middle
process did I find, wow.

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:05.346 A:middle
I sort of like software.

00:12:06.716 --> 00:12:08.196 A:middle
I like this process.

00:12:08.706 --> 00:12:09.986 A:middle
This is really interesting.

00:12:11.306 --> 00:12:12.656 A:middle
So, then began the process of

00:12:12.656 --> 00:12:13.646 A:middle
well, get a job.

00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:16.286 A:middle
I'm 17 years old.

00:12:17.466 --> 00:12:19.306 A:middle
What do I know as a 17-year-old?

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.696 A:middle
Plus, I'm a C4 quadriplegic.

00:12:22.246 --> 00:12:23.786 A:middle
Who was going to hire a dude in

00:12:23.786 --> 00:12:24.286 A:middle
a chair?

00:12:25.626 --> 00:12:27.156 A:middle
Again, just, you know you look

00:12:27.156 --> 00:12:28.736 A:middle
back and you sort of laugh.

00:12:28.736 --> 00:12:32.646 A:middle
173 resumes sent.

00:12:33.326 --> 00:12:35.086 A:middle
Every single tech job in the

00:12:35.086 --> 00:12:35.886 A:middle
Seattle PI.

00:12:36.176 --> 00:12:39.916 A:middle
I did a dozen interviews or

00:12:39.916 --> 00:12:41.126 A:middle
more, I can't remember now.

00:12:41.126 --> 00:12:43.686 A:middle
But they all ended with, you're

00:12:44.086 --> 00:12:45.066 A:middle
just not the right fit.

00:12:45.066 --> 00:12:49.066 A:middle
You're just not the right fit.

00:12:49.266 --> 00:12:51.796 A:middle
One was, you just don't have the

00:12:51.796 --> 00:12:53.996 A:middle
sort of the office skills that

00:12:53.996 --> 00:12:56.016 A:middle
we need.

00:12:56.236 --> 00:12:57.406 A:middle
Yeah, you got that right, you

00:12:58.006 --> 00:12:59.666 A:middle
know I can't staple worth crap

00:12:59.666 --> 00:12:59.966 A:middle
you know?

00:13:00.526 --> 00:13:01.976 A:middle
I can't even pick up a damn

00:13:02.496 --> 00:13:04.766 A:middle
phone. But OK.

00:13:05.066 --> 00:13:09.436 A:middle
And I won't mention the name of

00:13:09.926 --> 00:13:11.976 A:middle
that company.

00:13:12.046 --> 00:13:13.386 A:middle
Then it was like, how am I going

00:13:13.386 --> 00:13:14.526 A:middle
to get a job?

00:13:16.116 --> 00:13:18.806 A:middle
And I remember sending a fax

00:13:19.546 --> 00:13:20.386 A:middle
through my computer.

00:13:20.386 --> 00:13:24.026 A:middle
And the modem connected at 14.4

00:13:24.026 --> 00:13:24.526 A:middle
bod [phonic].

00:13:25.456 --> 00:13:26.776 A:middle
And I went, oh, yeah.

00:13:28.836 --> 00:13:30.196 A:middle
This place is legit.

00:13:30.566 --> 00:13:33.496 A:middle
I sent my res, and my cove.

00:13:33.496 --> 00:13:34.896 A:middle
And I got hired.

00:13:35.136 --> 00:13:37.476 A:middle
This big old dude, he's 6' 7".

00:13:37.476 --> 00:13:39.256 A:middle
He's huge, named Steven.

00:13:40.316 --> 00:13:41.776 A:middle
My attendant knocks on the door,

00:13:41.776 --> 00:13:42.546 A:middle
opens the door.

00:13:43.006 --> 00:13:43.906 A:middle
He looks down at me.

00:13:44.126 --> 00:13:46.106 A:middle
I'm, I'm here to apply for the

00:13:46.106 --> 00:13:47.256 A:middle
software develop job.

00:13:47.756 --> 00:13:48.616 A:middle
He's like yeah come on in.

00:13:48.616 --> 00:13:50.596 A:middle
He had to move his office all

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:52.716 A:middle
around so I could fit in his

00:13:53.736 --> 00:13:53.876 A:middle
office.

00:13:54.096 --> 00:13:55.996 A:middle
And he goes, how did you get

00:13:55.996 --> 00:13:56.816 A:middle
paralyzed.

00:13:57.986 --> 00:13:59.386 A:middle
Man, I think that's; you're not

00:13:59.386 --> 00:14:00.286 A:middle
supposed to say that [laughter].

00:14:01.396 --> 00:14:03.036 A:middle
That's the one rule they told me

00:14:03.036 --> 00:14:03.776 A:middle
they wouldn't do.

00:14:03.826 --> 00:14:06.646 A:middle
That's the first, the core first

00:14:06.646 --> 00:14:07.186 A:middle
question.

00:14:08.856 --> 00:14:11.006 A:middle
Second question, how much money

00:14:11.006 --> 00:14:11.446 A:middle
you want?

00:14:11.906 --> 00:14:14.206 A:middle
Well, they told me I could make

00:14:14.206 --> 00:14:15.456 A:middle
50 grand coming out of the

00:14:15.456 --> 00:14:15.926 A:middle
school.

00:14:15.926 --> 00:14:16.946 A:middle
No, you ain't going to make that

00:14:16.946 --> 00:14:17.286 A:middle
here.

00:14:17.906 --> 00:14:19.976 A:middle
Well, what do you want?

00:14:19.976 --> 00:14:21.706 A:middle
How about 25?

00:14:22.176 --> 00:14:23.166 A:middle
OK, sounds good.

00:14:23.326 --> 00:14:26.646 A:middle
I think I was 18 for about five

00:14:26.676 --> 00:14:27.146 A:middle
days.

00:14:27.146 --> 00:14:30.566 A:middle
I had no idea what I was doing.

00:14:30.566 --> 00:14:31.916 A:middle
Two days later got my job.

00:14:32.686 --> 00:14:35.226 A:middle
So, I'm 18 years old.

00:14:35.636 --> 00:14:37.306 A:middle
I'm working as a software

00:14:37.306 --> 00:14:39.146 A:middle
developer for a medical company.

00:14:39.816 --> 00:14:41.136 A:middle
Serving in the industry called

00:14:41.136 --> 00:14:41.866 A:middle
pathology.

00:14:43.406 --> 00:14:45.706 A:middle
Think of blood, think of sputum,

00:14:45.706 --> 00:14:47.886 A:middle
think of autopsies, right?

00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:49.176 A:middle
Things removed from the body.

00:14:49.716 --> 00:14:51.946 A:middle
And I begin my career as a

00:14:51.946 --> 00:14:52.836 A:middle
software developer.

00:14:55.796 --> 00:14:57.736 A:middle
About a year later, maybe 2

00:14:57.736 --> 00:15:01.596 A:middle
years later something profound

00:15:01.596 --> 00:15:02.016 A:middle
hit me.

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:05.136 A:middle
I'm wanted.

00:15:07.856 --> 00:15:09.116 A:middle
I'm valued.

00:15:09.506 --> 00:15:12.576 A:middle
I have purpose.

00:15:14.056 --> 00:15:15.196 A:middle
Now, I can only speak of my

00:15:15.196 --> 00:15:16.696 A:middle
story folks, but man you give a

00:15:16.696 --> 00:15:18.176 A:middle
man respect and you give man

00:15:18.206 --> 00:15:20.316 A:middle
purpose, that man is going to

00:15:20.496 --> 00:15:20.656 A:middle
do.

00:15:20.876 --> 00:15:25.956 A:middle
And he's going to do it right.

00:15:26.056 --> 00:15:28.906 A:middle
At that same time, as always,

00:15:30.196 --> 00:15:31.406 A:middle
did the government come by and

00:15:31.406 --> 00:15:34.146 A:middle
say hey, Todd, no more Social

00:15:34.146 --> 00:15:35.146 A:middle
Services for you.

00:15:35.676 --> 00:15:38.696 A:middle
And I'm like well, yeah but I've

00:15:38.696 --> 00:15:40.966 A:middle
got to; you've got a job.

00:15:41.436 --> 00:15:43.356 A:middle
Yeah, but I'm not like, I've

00:15:43.356 --> 00:15:44.866 A:middle
still got a lot to go.

00:15:45.006 --> 00:15:45.916 A:middle
No, you're done.

00:15:46.126 --> 00:15:47.056 A:middle
You either got a job or you

00:15:47.056 --> 00:15:47.366 A:middle
don't.

00:15:47.516 --> 00:15:50.346 A:middle
So, they pulled the funds.

00:15:50.806 --> 00:15:53.366 A:middle
I had to go to my boss and say

00:15:53.366 --> 00:15:54.396 A:middle
man I've got to make a lot more

00:15:54.396 --> 00:15:55.436 A:middle
than 25K.

00:15:56.656 --> 00:15:58.216 A:middle
He said, no problem.

00:15:59.796 --> 00:15:59.906 A:middle
Done.

00:16:00.096 --> 00:16:03.186 A:middle
What? Why couldn't we do this

00:16:03.366 --> 00:16:04.606 A:middle
two years ago [laughter]?

00:16:04.606 --> 00:16:09.976 A:middle
Later he told me he took

00:16:10.106 --> 00:16:14.176 A:middle
advantage of me because of my

00:16:14.176 --> 00:16:15.476 A:middle
disability [laughter].

00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:16.706 A:middle
Ain't that tight.

00:16:16.866 --> 00:16:19.746 A:middle
Man, way to go Steve.

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:21.106 A:middle
Mad respect.

00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:22.296 A:middle
I learned a ton from that dude.

00:16:22.486 --> 00:16:24.836 A:middle
I worked for that company for

00:16:24.836 --> 00:16:25.386 A:middle
years.

00:16:25.906 --> 00:16:30.586 A:middle
And I loved every minute of it.

00:16:30.846 --> 00:16:33.086 A:middle
I worked 24 hours a day, 7 days

00:16:33.086 --> 00:16:33.556 A:middle
a week.

00:16:35.236 --> 00:16:37.316 A:middle
I was mad sipping and puffing on

00:16:37.316 --> 00:16:37.976 A:middle
that software.

00:16:39.046 --> 00:16:40.336 A:middle
Just hitting it hard.

00:16:41.506 --> 00:16:42.986 A:middle
Fell in love with databases.

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:45.706 A:middle
Every aspect of the Microsoft

00:16:45.706 --> 00:16:46.416 A:middle
SQL database.

00:16:46.416 --> 00:16:47.686 A:middle
Hope I can say Microsoft.

00:16:47.686 --> 00:16:48.476 A:middle
I just did.

00:16:50.076 --> 00:16:52.596 A:middle
Legit. Hardware, software the

00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:54.506 A:middle
marriage of ray to rays.

00:16:55.696 --> 00:16:57.756 A:middle
Straight up hard core nerd.

00:17:00.456 --> 00:17:02.806 A:middle
But, I don't know after about 15

00:17:02.806 --> 00:17:05.176 A:middle
years, you tend to get the, I

00:17:05.176 --> 00:17:07.936 A:middle
want to be an employer, I'm an

00:17:07.936 --> 00:17:08.786 A:middle
entrepreneur.

00:17:08.786 --> 00:17:09.976 A:middle
I don't know if I want to be

00:17:09.976 --> 00:17:11.106 A:middle
that employee anymore.

00:17:13.136 --> 00:17:14.956 A:middle
One thing leads to another and

00:17:15.966 --> 00:17:17.626 A:middle
it looks like I'm about to make

00:17:17.626 --> 00:17:18.326 A:middle
my exit.

00:17:18.846 --> 00:17:21.106 A:middle
And this really, really cool

00:17:21.106 --> 00:17:24.466 A:middle
lady named Judith, my lateral,

00:17:26.196 --> 00:17:32.266 A:middle
diagnosed with stage IV.

00:17:32.466 --> 00:17:33.586 A:middle
Move from the chest to the

00:17:33.586 --> 00:17:34.276 A:middle
brain.

00:17:34.746 --> 00:17:38.366 A:middle
A few months before she exited

00:17:38.366 --> 00:17:43.116 A:middle
her earth suit, she told me I

00:17:43.826 --> 00:17:45.936 A:middle
had to bounce.

00:17:46.046 --> 00:17:47.296 A:middle
You better leave that job, T.

00:17:48.676 --> 00:17:49.676 A:middle
You were made for something

00:17:49.676 --> 00:17:50.096 A:middle
different.

00:17:55.956 --> 00:17:59.806 A:middle
So, she died.

00:18:00.046 --> 00:18:00.606 A:middle
And I quit.

00:18:01.096 --> 00:18:03.286 A:middle
And I did the one thing my

00:18:03.286 --> 00:18:04.846 A:middle
parents never told me, they

00:18:04.846 --> 00:18:07.086 A:middle
never said to do you quit a job

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.116 A:middle
before you got another job,

00:18:08.116 --> 00:18:08.876 A:middle
you've got a problem.

00:18:09.446 --> 00:18:12.156 A:middle
And I straight up did.

00:18:12.356 --> 00:18:15.346 A:middle
What am I going to do now?

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:18.936 A:middle
No problem, we'll be a comedian.

00:18:19.546 --> 00:18:21.446 A:middle
I'm going to write books, I'm

00:18:21.446 --> 00:18:23.526 A:middle
going to blog.

00:18:23.696 --> 00:18:24.596 A:middle
T, you better not do

00:18:24.596 --> 00:18:25.476 A:middle
punctuation.

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:28.036 A:middle
I'm doing a good day if I

00:18:28.036 --> 00:18:29.176 A:middle
putting a full sentence together

00:18:29.176 --> 00:18:29.616 A:middle
folks.

00:18:30.156 --> 00:18:32.226 A:middle
And I don't think my jokes are

00:18:32.226 --> 00:18:32.746 A:middle
too funny.

00:18:34.236 --> 00:18:35.476 A:middle
So, I made this business called

00:18:35.506 --> 00:18:37.296 A:middle
C4 consulting to make fun of my

00:18:37.296 --> 00:18:38.006 A:middle
disability.

00:18:38.946 --> 00:18:39.956 A:middle
I'm like ha ha.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.896 A:middle
I can do this.

00:18:43.676 --> 00:18:45.586 A:middle
Come to find out, that's not so

00:18:45.586 --> 00:18:46.096 A:middle
marketable.

00:18:46.096 --> 00:18:49.676 A:middle
Someone said to me, what's your

00:18:49.676 --> 00:18:51.006 A:middle
marketable skill, bro.

00:18:51.566 --> 00:18:53.386 A:middle
What you going to do for a job?

00:18:53.386 --> 00:18:54.426 A:middle
You all got to put groceries on

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:54.896 A:middle
the table.

00:18:54.896 --> 00:18:55.916 A:middle
You know how it is.

00:18:56.096 --> 00:18:57.356 A:middle
I love databases.

00:18:57.356 --> 00:19:00.076 A:middle
Well, go be a DBA.

00:19:00.196 --> 00:19:00.906 A:middle
All right cool.

00:19:01.986 --> 00:19:04.336 A:middle
So, C4 consulting became a DBA

00:19:04.336 --> 00:19:06.446 A:middle
service, subscription model.

00:19:06.446 --> 00:19:09.886 A:middle
Rent, pure play 24/7, I'll be

00:19:09.886 --> 00:19:11.436 A:middle
your DBA to the end.

00:19:12.066 --> 00:19:14.726 A:middle
What's the name of your company?

00:19:15.146 --> 00:19:17.866 A:middle
C4. Wait a minute T, you going

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:20.736 A:middle
to be a DBA but your company is

00:19:20.896 --> 00:19:21.186 A:middle
called C4?

00:19:21.186 --> 00:19:22.356 A:middle
That's an explosive [laughter].

00:19:24.996 --> 00:19:26.526 A:middle
Yeah, that cool?

00:19:26.526 --> 00:19:27.806 A:middle
You want to hire me?

00:19:28.056 --> 00:19:30.646 A:middle
I hope I don't blow it up.

00:19:31.306 --> 00:19:32.426 A:middle
And they did.

00:19:36.536 --> 00:19:38.726 A:middle
About that same time did I need

00:19:39.376 --> 00:19:41.206 A:middle
to go a wedding.

00:19:47.136 --> 00:19:48.736 A:middle
And I asked one of my staff, I

00:19:48.736 --> 00:19:49.806 A:middle
said I don't want to go to this

00:19:49.806 --> 00:19:52.036 A:middle
wedding, I'm crying like a baby

00:19:52.036 --> 00:19:53.246 A:middle
right now because it's real.

00:19:54.266 --> 00:19:55.956 A:middle
And she says to me, well who do

00:19:55.956 --> 00:19:57.376 A:middle
you want to go with?

00:19:57.376 --> 00:19:59.086 A:middle
I don't want to take an

00:19:59.086 --> 00:19:59.756 A:middle
employee.

00:20:00.016 --> 00:20:02.166 A:middle
I don't want to take a family

00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:02.556 A:middle
member.

00:20:03.336 --> 00:20:06.136 A:middle
I want to take a woman, and if

00:20:06.136 --> 00:20:07.446 A:middle
she's hot that'd be great.

00:20:09.446 --> 00:20:10.256 A:middle
You know Karen?

00:20:10.746 --> 00:20:11.426 A:middle
Who's Karen?

00:20:11.946 --> 00:20:14.546 A:middle
Then I met Karen.

00:20:15.036 --> 00:20:20.266 A:middle
And I fell in love with her the

00:20:20.516 --> 00:20:22.176 A:middle
moment I met her.

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.706 A:middle
And what was cool was she did

00:20:25.746 --> 00:20:26.116 A:middle
the same.

00:20:26.626 --> 00:20:29.646 A:middle
And we went to that wedding and

00:20:30.366 --> 00:20:32.216 A:middle
it was like we were the only two

00:20:34.256 --> 00:20:34.356 A:middle
there.

00:20:34.576 --> 00:20:35.986 A:middle
She got up to go get second

00:20:35.986 --> 00:20:37.696 A:middle
rounds on bread and food.

00:20:38.836 --> 00:20:40.226 A:middle
This strange lady leans over and

00:20:40.226 --> 00:20:42.866 A:middle
says, hey, she's laughing at all

00:20:42.866 --> 00:20:43.736 A:middle
your jokes.

00:20:43.736 --> 00:20:46.396 A:middle
I said, is that a good sign?

00:20:46.776 --> 00:20:48.096 A:middle
She said, yeah [laugther].

00:20:49.966 --> 00:20:51.586 A:middle
Your jokes aren't so good

00:20:51.586 --> 00:20:53.016 A:middle
[laughter].

00:20:53.516 --> 00:20:59.216 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:59.716 --> 00:21:01.236 A:middle
She says you also flirt real

00:21:01.236 --> 00:21:01.896 A:middle
well, too.

00:21:03.256 --> 00:21:04.206 A:middle
That's right.

00:21:04.786 --> 00:21:06.696 A:middle
I've got some skill.

00:21:07.086 --> 00:21:09.936 A:middle
So, Karen comes back and I'm

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:12.036 A:middle
blown away, she got some bread,

00:21:12.626 --> 00:21:15.066 A:middle
she got some wine, and there was

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:16.606 A:middle
more butter on the piece of

00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:20.316 A:middle
And folks I've got to tell you

00:21:20.316 --> 00:21:21.446 A:middle
right now, I'm all about that

butter.

00:21:22.386 --> 00:21:25.496 A:middle
And I was like oh, I've got to

00:21:25.496 --> 00:21:26.126 A:middle
get this one.

00:21:26.686 --> 00:21:28.916 A:middle
A couple months later she says

00:21:28.916 --> 00:21:30.046 A:middle
something like this, when you

00:21:30.046 --> 00:21:33.486 A:middle
ask it will be a yes.

00:21:33.676 --> 00:21:36.396 A:middle
What? Does that mean?

00:21:36.466 --> 00:21:37.966 A:middle
I got to grow up.

00:21:39.416 --> 00:21:41.126 A:middle
And I married Karen.

00:21:42.596 --> 00:21:44.786 A:middle
Karen Lynn Regal.

00:21:46.816 --> 00:21:48.436 A:middle
She became Karen Lynn

00:21:48.436 --> 00:21:49.206 A:middle
Stabelfeldt.

00:21:52.206 --> 00:21:55.146 A:middle
And about that same time, I saw

00:21:55.146 --> 00:21:56.976 A:middle
my boy, Samuel Jackson on a

00:21:56.976 --> 00:21:57.566 A:middle
commercial.

00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:59.916 A:middle
He says something like, 'Siri,

00:22:00.816 --> 00:22:02.696 A:middle
find me a recipe for gazpacho

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:03.016 A:middle
soup.

00:22:03.566 --> 00:22:06.376 A:middle
I was like, what's gazpacho

00:22:06.376 --> 00:22:06.926 A:middle
soup?

00:22:07.206 --> 00:22:11.246 A:middle
And I tasted it, what a horrible

00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:12.146 A:middle
choice for soup [laughter].

00:22:15.046 --> 00:22:16.186 A:middle
Who would want that.

00:22:16.856 --> 00:22:19.236 A:middle
I was like, I said I can use

00:22:19.236 --> 00:22:19.816 A:middle
that phone.

00:22:19.816 --> 00:22:22.036 A:middle
And the button.

00:22:22.036 --> 00:22:24.376 A:middle
Well I can't press the button.

00:22:25.036 --> 00:22:26.356 A:middle
I can tell you all right now, I

00:22:26.356 --> 00:22:28.026 A:middle
tried hacking and rewiring that

00:22:28.026 --> 00:22:28.856 A:middle
headset thing.

00:22:28.856 --> 00:22:30.196 A:middle
That just didn't work.

00:22:30.706 --> 00:22:33.846 A:middle
A few months later, I'm at a

00:22:33.846 --> 00:22:34.976 A:middle
quad squad meeting.

00:22:36.116 --> 00:22:39.226 A:middle
Yes, it's a meeting with quads.

00:22:39.666 --> 00:22:40.816 A:middle
We're a squad.

00:22:41.756 --> 00:22:44.046 A:middle
And by day we're horribly

00:22:44.046 --> 00:22:46.416 A:middle
disabled, and by night, we're

00:22:46.416 --> 00:22:48.586 A:middle
still horribly disabled.

00:22:49.556 --> 00:22:51.346 A:middle
But we do fantasize about

00:22:56.586 --> 00:22:58.106 A:middle
this out, he turns his head and

00:22:58.766 --> 00:23:00.226 A:middle
his iPad does this and he turns

00:23:00.226 --> 00:23:00.986 A:middle
his head the other way, did

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:01.896 A:middle
something else.

00:23:02.286 --> 00:23:03.676 A:middle
What's that?

00:23:04.506 --> 00:23:05.596 A:middle
It's called switch control.

00:23:07.016 --> 00:23:08.286 A:middle
Switch control?

00:23:09.316 --> 00:23:09.926 A:middle
What's that?

00:23:09.986 --> 00:23:11.246 A:middle
Don't know but I can do this

00:23:11.246 --> 00:23:11.996 A:middle
with my face.

00:23:12.256 --> 00:23:14.076 A:middle
And that's cool.

00:23:14.076 --> 00:23:14.996 A:middle
I said what's external?

00:23:14.996 --> 00:23:16.236 A:middle
I have no idea.

00:23:16.236 --> 00:23:19.566 A:middle
A few weeks later,

00:23:21.206 --> 00:23:26.686 A:middle
I'm with another friend and his

you hear about that TechLa?

00:23:28.636 --> 00:23:29.976 A:middle
I said, TechLa?

00:23:30.336 --> 00:23:30.966 A:middle
TechLa's crap.

00:23:30.966 --> 00:23:32.396 A:middle
And she said, no the new one.

00:23:33.056 --> 00:23:33.956 A:middle
I said, oh what's the new one

00:23:34.056 --> 00:23:34.786 A:middle
She said it works with a thing

00:23:34.786 --> 00:23:35.506 A:middle
called switch control.

00:23:36.036 --> 00:23:38.646 A:middle
And I'm like huh.

00:23:39.746 --> 00:23:43.006 A:middle

00:23:43.566 --> 00:23:44.696 A:middle
Let's try it.

00:23:44.696 --> 00:23:47.436 A:middle
So, I went out and bought some

00:23:47.436 --> 00:23:48.586 A:middle

00:24:03.386 --> 00:24:06.346 A:middle
That Blackberry had voice signal

00:24:06.346 --> 00:24:06.596 A:middle
on it.

00:24:06.596 --> 00:24:07.856 A:middle
I could do like three things.

00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:10.516 A:middle

Real deal.

to tell people some stuff.

We got three dogs, two cats.

00:24:44.406 --> 00:24:45.156 A:middle
went OK.

00:24:45.156 --> 00:24:46.186 A:middle
Because every good husband

00:24:46.186 --> 00:24:48.756 A:middle
listens to his wife.

a grant.

start telling everybody who

00:28:28.126 --> 00:28:32.546 A:middle
makes an app, everybody needs to

00:28:32.546 --> 00:28:33.926 A:middle
know how to develop these apps

00:28:33.926 --> 00:28:34.986 A:middle
with accessibility.

00:28:35.516 --> 00:28:41.576 A:middle
See, I say like this.

00:28:42.156 --> 00:28:45.066 A:middle
Apple brought me to a phone, and

00:28:46.496 --> 00:28:49.226 A:middle
they did a radical job of that.

00:28:50.616 --> 00:28:53.116 A:middle
But everybody out here in the

00:28:53.746 --> 00:28:55.476 A:middle
room, you bring me, you bring us

00:28:55.476 --> 00:28:56.136 A:middle
to the world.

00:28:57.476 --> 00:28:59.006 A:middle
Because you all smart people in

00:28:59.006 --> 00:28:59.516 A:middle
this room.

00:29:00.386 --> 00:29:01.506 A:middle
You got brains and you're making

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:02.066 A:middle
apps.

00:29:05.916 --> 00:29:07.656 A:middle
And when you make an app that's

00:29:07.656 --> 00:29:10.336 A:middle
convenient for you, written in

00:29:10.336 --> 00:29:11.966 A:middle
just the manner of rightness, it

00:29:12.016 --> 00:29:13.546 A:middle
could be independence for me.

00:29:14.096 --> 00:29:17.086 A:middle
I'm not one person.

00:29:17.086 --> 00:29:20.806 A:middle
I'm a part of millions of

00:29:20.806 --> 00:29:21.196 A:middle
people.

00:29:28.296 --> 00:29:32.446 A:middle
So, baby girl and I, we build a

00:29:32.446 --> 00:29:32.996 A:middle
house.

00:29:34.476 --> 00:29:35.876 A:middle
We call it the quadthedral.

00:29:40.136 --> 00:29:41.656 A:middle
And we begin to focus and

00:29:41.656 --> 00:29:43.976 A:middle
change, how do we make sure we

00:29:43.976 --> 00:29:45.496 A:middle
talk to app developers, where do

00:29:45.496 --> 00:29:46.366 A:middle
we go with that?

00:29:46.746 --> 00:29:47.876 A:middle
How do we help them?

00:29:48.166 --> 00:29:49.636 A:middle
What do we do?

00:29:51.126 --> 00:29:52.636 A:middle
And over the last couple years

00:29:52.636 --> 00:29:53.766 A:middle
it's just demonstration.

00:29:54.966 --> 00:29:56.196 A:middle
It's a video, it's this

00:29:56.196 --> 00:29:56.876 A:middle
blogging.

00:29:56.876 --> 00:29:58.016 A:middle
It's getting more people.

00:29:58.786 --> 00:30:00.266 A:middle
There's well over 20 people now

00:30:00.266 --> 00:30:01.646 A:middle
in this country that have a

00:30:01.646 --> 00:30:03.526 A:middle
setup, which I'm going to

00:30:03.526 --> 00:30:06.976 A:middle
explain to you here.

00:30:07.206 --> 00:30:08.186 A:middle
I'm in a wheel chair called a

00:30:08.186 --> 00:30:10.116 A:middle
Permobil F5.

00:30:10.216 --> 00:30:12.566 A:middle
Black on black.

00:30:13.096 --> 00:30:13.856 A:middle
West coast.

00:30:15.196 --> 00:30:16.116 A:middle
Murdered out.

00:30:20.256 --> 00:30:22.856 A:middle
this is Luis and Clark stuff

00:30:24.776 --> 00:30:24.886 A:middle
man.

00:30:25.096 --> 00:30:26.656 A:middle
Ok, cool you've got a phone on

00:30:26.656 --> 00:30:28.916 A:middle
your wheelchair, how is it

00:30:29.616 --> 00:30:33.936 A:middle
charge. Well, back in the day,

00:30:33.936 --> 00:30:35.006 A:middle
and back in the day that just

00:30:35.006 --> 00:30:36.396 A:middle
means like 2 years ago.

00:30:36.876 --> 00:30:39.766 A:middle
This thing was plugged into a

00:30:39.766 --> 00:30:41.326 A:middle
you know cigarette adapter

00:30:41.326 --> 00:30:43.216 A:middle
plugged into a battery on the

00:30:43.216 --> 00:30:44.076 A:middle
back of the chair.

00:30:46.196 --> 00:30:47.726 A:middle
Permobil is like well maybe we

00:30:47.726 --> 00:30:48.736 A:middle
should do something different.

00:30:49.196 --> 00:30:50.466 A:middle
Sounds good Permobil.

00:30:50.636 --> 00:30:54.256 A:middle
So, now there's integration.

00:30:57.316 --> 00:31:01.146 A:middle
And TechLa, the Bluetooth device

00:31:01.926 --> 00:31:03.686 A:middle
that pairs to the iOS.

00:31:03.866 --> 00:31:07.796 A:middle
I can do buttons which I'm going

00:31:07.796 --> 00:31:09.236 A:middle
to show you here at any second.

00:31:09.756 --> 00:31:12.176 A:middle
It was like people started

00:31:12.176 --> 00:31:13.696 A:middle
realizing, well this is legit.

00:31:14.896 --> 00:31:16.096 A:middle
This is real.

00:31:17.236 --> 00:31:18.656 A:middle
We need to keep moving forward.

00:31:20.696 --> 00:31:23.396 A:middle
So, now I'm going to show you

00:31:23.526 --> 00:31:24.566 A:middle
how this works.

00:31:25.526 --> 00:31:27.976 A:middle
You dig?

00:31:28.516 --> 00:31:34.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:31:35.046 --> 00:31:36.946 A:middle
So, I use a TechLa, go for it.

00:31:37.506 --> 00:31:39.976 A:middle
I use a TechLa and an eye device

00:31:41.436 --> 00:31:42.676 A:middle
to control my wheelchair, my

00:31:42.676 --> 00:31:46.976 A:middle
phone and everything.

00:31:47.056 --> 00:31:47.216 A:middle
All right.

00:31:47.216 --> 00:31:49.206 A:middle
So, we got that there, we got

00:31:49.206 --> 00:31:50.436 A:middle
that coming up.

00:31:50.776 --> 00:31:52.346 A:middle
Now you about to see my big ol'

00:31:52.346 --> 00:31:53.276 A:middle
hairy face.

00:31:53.516 --> 00:31:56.286 A:middle
Now, I'll tell you right now, my

00:31:56.286 --> 00:31:57.786 A:middle
company we had to do an app real

00:31:57.786 --> 00:31:58.976 A:middle
fast, back in November.

00:31:59.206 --> 00:32:00.626 A:middle
And I don't know who puts an app

00:32:00.626 --> 00:32:01.946 A:middle
up in a month and a half, but we

00:32:01.946 --> 00:32:02.266 A:middle
did.

00:32:02.726 --> 00:32:04.166 A:middle
And I told myself I'm going to

00:32:04.166 --> 00:32:05.066 A:middle
grow out my hair.

00:32:05.846 --> 00:32:06.776 A:middle
So, this right here, I'm just

00:32:06.776 --> 00:32:07.966 A:middle
going to move my mustache hair.

00:32:07.966 --> 00:32:12.496 A:middle
That's how I do it, OK

00:32:12.496 --> 00:32:12.563 A:middle
[laughter]?

00:32:12.563 --> 00:32:14.036 A:middle
That's for you Felice.

00:32:16.566 --> 00:32:19.106 A:middle
All right.

00:32:19.476 --> 00:32:20.026 A:middle
All right.

00:32:22.196 --> 00:32:23.886 A:middle
There's a lot going on folks,

00:32:24.586 --> 00:32:25.726 A:middle
but I'm cold old school.

00:32:25.806 --> 00:32:27.026 A:middle
I'm going to call it direct

00:32:27.026 --> 00:32:27.666 A:middle
access.

00:32:27.976 --> 00:32:28.996 A:middle
So, what I'm going to do is

00:32:28.996 --> 00:32:30.986 A:middle
explain some buttons and show

00:32:30.986 --> 00:32:31.826 A:middle
you some things.

00:32:31.826 --> 00:32:33.536 A:middle
Okay, so give me a second here.

00:32:40.116 --> 00:32:41.836 A:middle
All right starting from my left

00:32:41.946 --> 00:32:44.616 A:middle
to right, I have buttons.

00:32:45.126 --> 00:32:46.566 A:middle
And I'm going to use my tongue,

00:32:47.176 --> 00:32:48.456 A:middle
and now you just all got to

00:32:48.456 --> 00:32:48.946 A:middle
handle it.

00:32:50.386 --> 00:32:51.356 A:middle
Button number one.

00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:55.716 A:middle
It's called move bad, move

00:32:58.116 --> 00:32:58.686 A:middle
previous.

00:33:00.486 --> 00:33:02.626 A:middle
OK? Middle button or second

00:33:02.726 --> 00:33:04.196 A:middle
button, select.

00:33:06.076 --> 00:33:06.726 A:middle
All right.

00:33:08.516 --> 00:33:10.766 A:middle
Third button, move next.

00:33:14.446 --> 00:33:16.556 A:middle
OK? Get all that?

00:33:16.636 --> 00:33:18.076 A:middle
Another button on this side for

00:33:18.316 --> 00:33:19.526 A:middle
the wheelchair.

Another button, wheelchair.

00:33:22.396 --> 00:33:24.186 A:middle
Another button volume down,

00:33:24.186 --> 00:33:25.166 A:middle
volume up.

Woot, woot for long press.

Water straw for drinking.

00:33:36.556 --> 00:33:38.286 A:middle
And it's just water, folks.

00:33:38.286 --> 00:33:40.686 A:middle
Okay, it's just water.

00:33:41.446 --> 00:33:42.496 A:middle
No smell no tell.

00:33:42.496 --> 00:33:43.066 A:middle
Here we go.

00:33:44.266 --> 00:33:44.736 A:middle
All right.

00:33:46.116 --> 00:33:47.286 A:middle
I'm so glad the front row's

laughing [laugther].

00:33:47.786 --> 00:33:50.366 A:middle
I don't have no idea if any

00:33:50.366 --> 00:33:51.446 A:middle
other rows are laughing.

00:33:51.866 --> 00:33:54.596 A:middle
Legit. OK, so.

00:33:55.656 --> 00:33:58.796 A:middle
If I also want to, I can go into

00:33:58.796 --> 00:33:59.546 A:middle
a particular mode in my

00:33:59.546 --> 00:34:01.986 A:middle

called in eye device.

00:34:03.266 --> 00:34:05.606 A:middle
Now, I can use my joystick to

OK? This is legit people.

00:34:13.806 --> 00:34:15.996 A:middle
This is harnessing everybody.

00:34:15.996 --> 00:34:19.226 A:middle
You have a workforce that is

00:34:19.226 --> 00:34:20.916 A:middle
disabled, that could be

00:34:20.916 --> 00:34:22.796 A:middle
employees if given the

00:34:22.796 --> 00:34:24.026 A:middle
opportunity to do so.

00:34:27.416 --> 00:34:28.226 A:middle
Thanks, brother.

00:34:29.126 --> 00:34:29.346 A:middle
All right.

00:34:29.346 --> 00:34:29.556 A:middle
Here we go.

00:34:29.626 --> 00:34:31.246 A:middle
Now, we're just going to go

00:34:31.246 --> 00:34:32.156 A:middle
through some apps and we're

00:34:32.156 --> 00:34:33.196 A:middle
going to show you some things.

00:34:33.826 --> 00:34:34.716 A:middle
So, we're good on the face

00:34:36.976 --> 00:34:38.186 A:middle
All right.

00:34:40.236 --> 00:34:45.766 A:middle
So, for example, I'm just sort

00:34:45.766 --> 00:34:49.106 A:middle
of navigating a bit, so you can

00:34:49.106 --> 00:34:51.126 A:middle

independence, independence.

00:37:13.336 --> 00:37:14.246 A:middle
I'm a grown man.

00:37:14.246 --> 00:37:16.236 A:middle
I want to be able to take care

00:37:16.236 --> 00:37:16.846 A:middle
of my girl.

00:37:17.346 --> 00:37:18.226 A:middle

00:37:24.756 --> 00:37:28.706 A:middle
So, we'll check out HomeKit.

00:37:28.706 --> 00:37:30.706 A:middle
Again, folks.

convenience for you is literally

00:37:34.706 --> 00:37:35.926 A:middle
independence for me.

happening [laughter].

00:37:49.376 --> 00:37:53.726 A:middle
HomeKit changed the game.

00:37:53.936 --> 00:37:54.746 A:middle
Now, what?

00:37:54.796 --> 00:37:59.086 A:middle
Now I can do doors and security,

00:37:59.376 --> 00:38:00.686 A:middle
and oh.

00:38:01.296 --> 00:38:04.056 A:middle
I get to do this from the phone.

00:38:04.116 --> 00:38:09.416 A:middle
We'll let that one just marinate

00:38:09.416 --> 00:38:10.086 A:middle
for a moment.

This one's legit.

00:38:12.936 --> 00:38:15.856 A:middle

video.

00:38:17.766 --> 00:38:18.896 A:middle
Because this one was actually a

lot of fun to make.

Hey Siri set business time.

I refuse for this story to be a

Hey Siri, play dinner playlist.

You're going to see tonight,

you're getting a whole group of
