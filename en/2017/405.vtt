00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. Good afternoon.

00:00:24.506 --> 00:00:26.546 A:middle
Welcome. My name's Kieron

00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:26.946 A:middle
Seenya.

00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:29.466 A:middle
I'm an Xcode engineer at Apple.

00:00:30.126 --> 00:00:31.616 A:middle
I'm really excited to share with

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:33.286 A:middle
you some of the new source

00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:35.456 A:middle
control features of Xcode 9.

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.106 A:middle
In fact, I'm so excited about it

00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:40.336 A:middle
it's now a first class citizen

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:40.686 A:middle
of Xcode.

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:42.856 A:middle
Today you're going to learn

00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:44.526 A:middle
about some of the great concepts

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:46.736 A:middle
of SCM and how they fit in with

00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:47.316 A:middle
Xcode 9.

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:48.806 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:51.426 A:middle
So I've got a lot of work to get

00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:52.106 A:middle
done today.

00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:54.486 A:middle
The first thing I need to do is

00:00:54.486 --> 00:00:56.736 A:middle
to get my project and to do that

00:00:57.206 --> 00:00:58.066 A:middle
I need to clone it.

00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:02.266 A:middle
Next up I'm going to review some

00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:02.266 A:middle
Next up I'm going to review some

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.876 A:middle
recent changes that happened in

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:04.465 A:middle
the project.

00:01:04.506 --> 00:01:05.646 A:middle
So I'm going to look at some

00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:06.216 A:middle
commits.

00:01:06.786 --> 00:01:09.406 A:middle
After that I've got some feature

00:01:09.406 --> 00:01:10.376 A:middle
work I need to do.

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.186 A:middle
So I'm going to create a branch

00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:13.856 A:middle
to make sure my changes aren't

00:01:13.856 --> 00:01:15.186 A:middle
affecting the rest of my team.

00:01:15.746 --> 00:01:18.946 A:middle
And then I'm going to release my

00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:19.936 A:middle
app to the App Store.

00:01:20.506 --> 00:01:22.026 A:middle
So I'll create a tag to make

00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:24.126 A:middle
sure I know when that happened.

00:01:25.756 --> 00:01:27.056 A:middle
The first thing I need to do

00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:28.436 A:middle
though is clone the project.

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:30.126 A:middle
So let's take a look at what

00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:31.406 A:middle
that is, if you're unfamiliar.

00:01:31.406 --> 00:01:34.646 A:middle
In most cases you're going to

00:01:34.736 --> 00:01:37.036 A:middle
have a single, centralized copy

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:37.916 A:middle
of your source code.

00:01:38.436 --> 00:01:39.956 A:middle
This is known as a remote

00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:40.616 A:middle
repository.

00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:43.006 A:middle
And this stores all the history

00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:44.376 A:middle
of your projects and all the

00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:45.746 A:middle
changes that make up that

00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:46.176 A:middle
history.

00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:49.906 A:middle
And just like it sounds, cloning

00:01:49.906 --> 00:01:52.326 A:middle
creates an exact copy of all the

00:01:52.326 --> 00:01:53.986 A:middle
code and brings it down onto

00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:55.656 A:middle
your MacBook and you can start

00:01:55.656 --> 00:01:56.066 A:middle
working.

00:01:56.956 --> 00:01:58.526 A:middle
So how does this fit into Xcode

00:01:58.526 --> 00:01:59.000 A:middle
9?

00:02:00.776 --> 00:02:02.986 A:middle
Well, with your GitHub account

00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:04.916 A:middle
connected we've introduced an

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:07.076 A:middle
entirely new clone workflow.

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:09.346 A:middle
When you've added your GitHub

00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:10.596 A:middle
account you'll get a list of

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:11.916 A:middle
your personal repositories.

00:02:12.276 --> 00:02:13.326 A:middle
You'll also get a list of the

00:02:13.326 --> 00:02:15.246 A:middle
starred ones and all of those

00:02:15.246 --> 00:02:16.796 A:middle
belonging to your organization.

00:02:18.156 --> 00:02:19.696 A:middle
And it is really easy to find

00:02:19.696 --> 00:02:20.696 A:middle
what you're looking for from

00:02:20.696 --> 00:02:21.016 A:middle
here.

00:02:21.526 --> 00:02:23.266 A:middle
Immediately I can see all of my

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:24.006 A:middle
repositories.

00:02:26.436 --> 00:02:28.066 A:middle
There's also a detail pane at

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:28.666 A:middle
the bottom.

00:02:28.826 --> 00:02:30.066 A:middle
So I can see more information

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.226 A:middle
about those repositories.

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:33.096 A:middle
And from here I can even star an

00:02:33.096 --> 00:02:34.096 A:middle
interesting repository.

00:02:34.096 --> 00:02:35.326 A:middle
So I can come back to it later.

00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:37.856 A:middle
There's full search capability

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:38.226 A:middle
in here.

00:02:38.576 --> 00:02:40.146 A:middle
So using the address bar at the

00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:41.536 A:middle
top, I can enter some search

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:43.166 A:middle
criteria and search across

00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:43.626 A:middle
GitHub.

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:45.256 A:middle
This saves you having to jump to

00:02:45.256 --> 00:02:46.926 A:middle
GitHub to find the repository

00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:47.686 A:middle
you're looking for.

00:02:48.286 --> 00:02:51.666 A:middle
So I go ahead and select this

00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:55.366 A:middle
TOTP app, but I can also clone

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:57.006 A:middle
any other repository that's not

00:02:57.006 --> 00:02:58.696 A:middle
part of GitHub by just entering

00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:00.246 A:middle
the URL of it in that address

00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:00.246 A:middle
the URL of it in that address

00:03:00.326 --> 00:03:00.716 A:middle
bar there.

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:02.826 A:middle
So when I've found what I'm

00:03:02.826 --> 00:03:04.106 A:middle
looking for I hit the "clone"

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:06.776 A:middle
button and it asks me where I

00:03:06.776 --> 00:03:07.416 A:middle
want to save it.

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:10.376 A:middle
I choose here, click clone, and

00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:11.546 A:middle
it just goes ahead and clones

00:03:11.546 --> 00:03:11.686 A:middle
it.

00:03:11.686 --> 00:03:12.546 A:middle
It's that simple.

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:16.546 A:middle
Now in the mornings when I'm

00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:18.906 A:middle
sipping my cup of earl gray I

00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:20.096 A:middle
need to get access to my

00:03:20.096 --> 00:03:20.676 A:middle
repository.

00:03:20.676 --> 00:03:22.456 A:middle
I don't want to flip back to

00:03:22.456 --> 00:03:23.016 A:middle
Xcodes to do that.

00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:23.886 A:middle
I don't want to have to search

00:03:23.886 --> 00:03:24.126 A:middle
for it.

00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:26.386 A:middle
So now we work closely with

00:03:26.386 --> 00:03:28.656 A:middle
GitHub so you can clone your

00:03:28.656 --> 00:03:30.396 A:middle
Xcode projects right from

00:03:30.396 --> 00:03:31.226 A:middle
github.com.

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:33.286 A:middle
You find the repo you're looking

00:03:33.286 --> 00:03:34.996 A:middle
for, hit the clone or download

00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:37.016 A:middle
button, and here you'll see an

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:37.976 A:middle
"open in Xcode" button.

00:03:38.636 --> 00:03:39.496 A:middle
It's really easy.

00:03:39.496 --> 00:03:39.976 A:middle
It's really handy.

00:03:40.516 --> 00:03:45.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:47.366 A:middle
So that's cloning in Xcode 9.

00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:50.166 A:middle
So next up I want to review some

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:51.206 A:middle
changes that have happened

00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:51.876 A:middle
recently.

00:03:52.746 --> 00:03:53.646 A:middle
So I'm going to look at some

00:03:53.646 --> 00:03:54.136 A:middle
commits.

00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:55.906 A:middle
Now if you're unfamiliar let's

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:56.546 A:middle
take a look at this.

00:03:57.196 --> 00:03:59.306 A:middle
And this star represents a

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:00.376 A:middle
single commit.

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:00.376 A:middle
single commit.

00:04:00.756 --> 00:04:02.666 A:middle
It is a snapshot of all the

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:03.696 A:middle
changes that have happened in my

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:07.526 A:middle
project at that point in time.

00:04:07.986 --> 00:04:09.636 A:middle
Committing changes to a project

00:04:09.846 --> 00:04:10.806 A:middle
is something you're probably

00:04:10.806 --> 00:04:12.476 A:middle
going to do many times a day and

00:04:13.516 --> 00:04:15.766 A:middle
each commit adds history to your

00:04:15.766 --> 00:04:16.245 A:middle
project.

00:04:16.245 --> 00:04:19.226 A:middle
And this history's invaluable

00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:21.036 A:middle
for keeping track of your code

00:04:21.036 --> 00:04:22.586 A:middle
base, knowing who is changing

00:04:22.586 --> 00:04:23.606 A:middle
what and why.

00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:27.496 A:middle
Now every commit has an author.

00:04:28.646 --> 00:04:29.836 A:middle
This lets you know who to blame.

00:04:30.746 --> 00:04:33.396 A:middle
It also has a description so you

00:04:33.396 --> 00:04:34.856 A:middle
know why that change happened.

00:04:35.846 --> 00:04:37.766 A:middle
There's also a date just to let

00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:38.536 A:middle
you know when it happened.

00:04:38.536 --> 00:04:39.796 A:middle
And finally something called a

00:04:39.796 --> 00:04:41.096 A:middle
shar, which is the unique

00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:42.456 A:middle
identifier for that commit.

00:04:43.246 --> 00:04:44.756 A:middle
It lets you reference it later

00:04:44.756 --> 00:04:45.596 A:middle
on if you need to.

00:04:46.896 --> 00:04:48.746 A:middle
So, as this information, along

00:04:48.746 --> 00:04:50.056 A:middle
with the changes captured by the

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.016 A:middle
commit, this makes up the rich

00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:53.306 A:middle
history of your project.

00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:55.496 A:middle
So how does this fit into Xcode

00:04:55.496 --> 00:04:55.816 A:middle
9?

00:04:56.836 --> 00:04:58.076 A:middle
Well, we can see here.

00:04:58.706 --> 00:05:02.796 A:middle
In Xcode 9 there's entirely new

00:04:58.706 --> 00:05:02.796 A:middle
In Xcode 9 there's entirely new

00:05:02.796 --> 00:05:04.296 A:middle
feature set for source control

00:05:04.296 --> 00:05:05.216 A:middle
allowing you to see your

00:05:05.216 --> 00:05:05.616 A:middle
history.

00:05:06.566 --> 00:05:07.726 A:middle
On the left hand side we've

00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:09.376 A:middle
introduced an entirely new

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:10.016 A:middle
navigator.

00:05:10.486 --> 00:05:12.166 A:middle
This'll list the working copies

00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:13.656 A:middle
that are part of your project.

00:05:14.506 --> 00:05:15.396 A:middle
When you select one of those

00:05:15.396 --> 00:05:17.376 A:middle
working copies you'll get this

00:05:17.376 --> 00:05:18.576 A:middle
new history view.

00:05:19.396 --> 00:05:20.896 A:middle
This lists all of your commits

00:05:20.896 --> 00:05:21.976 A:middle
and we've been using it in

00:05:21.976 --> 00:05:23.086 A:middle
Xcode's code base.

00:05:23.646 --> 00:05:24.746 A:middle
We have around a quarter of a

00:05:24.746 --> 00:05:26.076 A:middle
million commits and we can

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.256 A:middle
scroll through really smoothly.

00:05:28.256 --> 00:05:29.286 A:middle
It's really great.

00:05:30.276 --> 00:05:32.656 A:middle
For each of these entries there

00:05:32.736 --> 00:05:35.456 A:middle
is those details you saw before;

00:05:35.456 --> 00:05:36.586 A:middle
the author, the description.

00:05:36.626 --> 00:05:37.446 A:middle
This is really useful

00:05:37.446 --> 00:05:38.866 A:middle
information, but with your

00:05:38.866 --> 00:05:40.896 A:middle
GitHub account connected we now

00:05:40.896 --> 00:05:42.126 A:middle
go and get your avatar.

00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:45.826 A:middle
So you can put a face to the

00:05:45.826 --> 00:05:49.196 A:middle
name or the name to the face.

00:05:49.276 --> 00:05:50.376 A:middle
So let's say I'm looking for a

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:52.126 A:middle
specific commit, something I

00:05:52.126 --> 00:05:53.496 A:middle
know my colleague Eric [assumed

00:05:53.646 --> 00:05:55.806 A:middle
spelling] committed recently and

00:05:55.806 --> 00:05:56.856 A:middle
I'm not entirely sure what I'm

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:57.506 A:middle
looking for.

00:05:58.946 --> 00:06:02.656 A:middle
So we can now search by token.

00:05:58.946 --> 00:06:02.656 A:middle
So we can now search by token.

00:06:03.336 --> 00:06:05.656 A:middle
So here I specify I'm looking

00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:06.096 A:middle
for Eric.

00:06:07.026 --> 00:06:08.206 A:middle
Now that gives me a big list of

00:06:08.206 --> 00:06:08.536 A:middle
commits.

00:06:08.536 --> 00:06:09.716 A:middle
I still need to narrow it down a

00:06:09.716 --> 00:06:09.946 A:middle
bit further.

00:06:09.986 --> 00:06:11.936 A:middle
So let's find out what happened

00:06:11.936 --> 00:06:13.026 A:middle
the last day because I know it

00:06:13.026 --> 00:06:13.736 A:middle
was that recent.

00:06:14.466 --> 00:06:16.666 A:middle
So I use this scope bar and

00:06:16.666 --> 00:06:18.426 A:middle
search for the last 24 hours.

00:06:18.716 --> 00:06:19.756 A:middle
I still got four results.

00:06:19.756 --> 00:06:20.556 A:middle
I'm a bit lazy.

00:06:20.556 --> 00:06:21.536 A:middle
I don't want to read through the

00:06:21.536 --> 00:06:22.336 A:middle
commit messages.

00:06:22.746 --> 00:06:27.846 A:middle
So I know it has something to do

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:28.646 A:middle
with cofeeing.

00:06:29.016 --> 00:06:29.926 A:middle
[laughing] So it narrows the

00:06:29.926 --> 00:06:31.416 A:middle
result down to that individual

00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:32.376 A:middle
result, and that's the one I was

00:06:32.376 --> 00:06:32.976 A:middle
looking for.

00:06:33.766 --> 00:06:34.996 A:middle
And these search results come

00:06:34.996 --> 00:06:35.996 A:middle
back instantly.

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:37.146 A:middle
It's really fast.

00:06:37.516 --> 00:06:40.006 A:middle
You've got to try it out.

00:06:40.336 --> 00:06:42.336 A:middle
So that's commit in Xcode 9.

00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:46.336 A:middle
So now that I've cloned my

00:06:46.336 --> 00:06:48.146 A:middle
project and I've reviewed commit

00:06:48.146 --> 00:06:49.826 A:middle
it's time I worked on something

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.386 A:middle
that's a bit risky maybe.

00:06:52.166 --> 00:06:53.246 A:middle
To do that I want to create a

00:06:53.306 --> 00:06:54.626 A:middle
branch and this will help

00:06:54.626 --> 00:06:56.796 A:middle
isolate my changes from the rest

00:06:56.796 --> 00:06:57.996 A:middle
of the team's so they don't get

00:06:57.996 --> 00:06:58.456 A:middle
affected.

00:06:58.456 --> 00:07:01.576 A:middle
So let's go back to this commit

00:06:58.456 --> 00:07:01.576 A:middle
So let's go back to this commit

00:07:01.576 --> 00:07:03.076 A:middle
docs we saw earlier.

00:07:03.196 --> 00:07:04.586 A:middle
Now my master branch is in

00:07:04.636 --> 00:07:05.606 A:middle
pretty good shape.

00:07:05.936 --> 00:07:06.836 A:middle
Everything's stable.

00:07:06.836 --> 00:07:08.836 A:middle
My bot's passing their unit

00:07:08.836 --> 00:07:09.116 A:middle
test.

00:07:09.166 --> 00:07:10.646 A:middle
So I'm going to go ahead and

00:07:10.646 --> 00:07:11.626 A:middle
create a branch from there.

00:07:12.386 --> 00:07:13.676 A:middle
So it goes to new navigator.

00:07:14.226 --> 00:07:15.616 A:middle
I hit "new branch" from master

00:07:15.616 --> 00:07:17.736 A:middle
and Xcode goes ahead and just

00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:18.216 A:middle
creates it.

00:07:19.576 --> 00:07:20.956 A:middle
Now my new branch is going to be

00:07:20.956 --> 00:07:22.096 A:middle
pushed to the top of the list

00:07:22.386 --> 00:07:23.526 A:middle
and marked as "current."

00:07:23.896 --> 00:07:24.716 A:middle
This lets me know what I'm

00:07:24.716 --> 00:07:25.616 A:middle
currently working on.

00:07:25.616 --> 00:07:26.676 A:middle
It's really easy to see.

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:28.826 A:middle
And you can see in this diagram

00:07:28.826 --> 00:07:30.696 A:middle
here; history has now diverged.

00:07:30.766 --> 00:07:32.726 A:middle
This means my commit is no

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.566 A:middle
longer part of master.

00:07:34.566 --> 00:07:35.846 A:middle
So my changes aren't going to

00:07:35.846 --> 00:07:38.626 A:middle
affect my team and they're going

00:07:38.626 --> 00:07:41.116 A:middle
to carry on committing and

00:07:41.116 --> 00:07:42.056 A:middle
they'll carry on committing and

00:07:42.056 --> 00:07:43.116 A:middle
it won't affect me.

00:07:43.116 --> 00:07:44.596 A:middle
And as I carry on committing

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:45.386 A:middle
it's not going to affect them.

00:07:45.386 --> 00:07:47.076 A:middle
And this is a good place to be

00:07:47.076 --> 00:07:47.946 A:middle
when you're working on some

00:07:47.946 --> 00:07:48.446 A:middle
risky work.

00:07:49.956 --> 00:07:51.316 A:middle
So now my tests are passing on

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:52.566 A:middle
my feature branch and I want to

00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:54.566 A:middle
land those changes back into the

00:07:54.566 --> 00:07:55.386 A:middle
master branch.

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.596 A:middle
So to do that I go to the new

00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:00.326 A:middle
source control navigator, I hit

00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:00.326 A:middle
source control navigator, I hit

00:08:00.326 --> 00:08:02.566 A:middle
the merge button and my changes

00:08:02.776 --> 00:08:04.146 A:middle
have landed in.

00:08:05.476 --> 00:08:06.876 A:middle
The thing is though, those

00:08:06.876 --> 00:08:08.436 A:middle
changes haven't been published

00:08:08.436 --> 00:08:09.646 A:middle
to my service so the rest of the

00:08:09.746 --> 00:08:11.136 A:middle
team can't see them.

00:08:12.386 --> 00:08:14.226 A:middle
So how does this tie in with

00:08:14.226 --> 00:08:15.446 A:middle
Xcode's new navigator?

00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:16.846 A:middle
Well, let's go back to that

00:08:16.946 --> 00:08:18.616 A:middle
cloud illustration that we saw

00:08:18.616 --> 00:08:18.786 A:middle
earlier.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.446 A:middle
And as I make changes and as

00:08:21.446 --> 00:08:22.716 A:middle
others make changes we need to

00:08:22.716 --> 00:08:24.106 A:middle
synchronize those changes.

00:08:24.616 --> 00:08:26.686 A:middle
And to do that you can pull

00:08:26.686 --> 00:08:27.806 A:middle
changes from the remote

00:08:27.806 --> 00:08:28.486 A:middle
repository.

00:08:28.486 --> 00:08:30.966 A:middle
And when I've made my changes

00:08:31.156 --> 00:08:32.316 A:middle
I'll go ahead and push those.

00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:34.775 A:middle
And this is really useful when

00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:35.596 A:middle
you're working in a team

00:08:35.596 --> 00:08:37.306 A:middle
environment because you can

00:08:37.306 --> 00:08:39.106 A:middle
carry on pushing and pulling to

00:08:39.106 --> 00:08:39.796 A:middle
make sure you have each other's

00:08:39.796 --> 00:08:39.976 A:middle
changes.

00:08:46.056 --> 00:08:48.686 A:middle
So after I've merged and I need

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:51.076 A:middle
to push those changes I have

00:08:51.226 --> 00:08:53.256 A:middle
three commits I need to push and

00:08:53.386 --> 00:08:55.026 A:middle
Xcode will automatically display

00:08:55.026 --> 00:08:56.706 A:middle
these in the new navigator so I

00:08:56.706 --> 00:08:58.166 A:middle
know my team can't see them.

00:08:58.846 --> 00:09:01.546 A:middle
And in Xcode 9 we automatically

00:08:58.846 --> 00:09:01.546 A:middle
And in Xcode 9 we automatically

00:09:01.646 --> 00:09:02.626 A:middle
fetch from your remote

00:09:02.626 --> 00:09:04.696 A:middle
repositories and this lets you

00:09:04.696 --> 00:09:06.226 A:middle
know if your team have been

00:09:06.226 --> 00:09:07.956 A:middle
making changes that you need to

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:08.396 A:middle
pull.

00:09:08.626 --> 00:09:09.766 A:middle
And you'll see it with these up

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:10.576 A:middle
and down arrows.

00:09:10.966 --> 00:09:12.416 A:middle
This is good to know because you

00:09:12.706 --> 00:09:14.366 A:middle
can't go ahead and push until

00:09:14.366 --> 00:09:16.416 A:middle
you've pulled their changes in.

00:09:17.536 --> 00:09:22.656 A:middle
So that's branching in Xcode 9.

00:09:22.876 --> 00:09:24.346 A:middle
So now I'm ready to release a

00:09:24.346 --> 00:09:25.376 A:middle
beta version of my app.

00:09:26.046 --> 00:09:27.066 A:middle
The tests are passing, I've

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:28.616 A:middle
merged all my work into master.

00:09:29.676 --> 00:09:30.956 A:middle
So let's go back to those docs

00:09:30.956 --> 00:09:31.786 A:middle
that we saw earlier.

00:09:32.866 --> 00:09:34.506 A:middle
At specific points of time in

00:09:34.596 --> 00:09:36.306 A:middle
your project's history you'll

00:09:36.306 --> 00:09:37.316 A:middle
want to create a tag.

00:09:37.386 --> 00:09:38.976 A:middle
This lets you know all of the

00:09:38.976 --> 00:09:40.556 A:middle
changes that made it up until

00:09:40.556 --> 00:09:41.386 A:middle
that point in time.

00:09:42.106 --> 00:09:43.286 A:middle
It's a good idea to do this when

00:09:43.286 --> 00:09:44.376 A:middle
you release your app to the App

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:45.356 A:middle
Store for example.

00:09:45.356 --> 00:09:46.956 A:middle
So you -- to help you track what

00:09:46.956 --> 00:09:48.366 A:middle
changes were made.

00:09:49.356 --> 00:09:51.066 A:middle
So we'll continue to do this and

00:09:51.066 --> 00:09:52.636 A:middle
here I'm creating my Beta 4 tag

00:09:53.336 --> 00:09:54.776 A:middle
and you'll continue to do this

00:09:54.776 --> 00:09:56.626 A:middle
as you release more versions of

00:09:56.926 --> 00:10:00.346 A:middle
your app to the App Store.

00:09:56.926 --> 00:10:00.346 A:middle
your app to the App Store.

00:10:00.596 --> 00:10:02.796 A:middle
So now on Xcode 9 we have full

00:10:03.126 --> 00:10:04.026 A:middle
tagging support.

00:10:04.626 --> 00:10:06.086 A:middle
You can go to the new history

00:10:06.086 --> 00:10:08.066 A:middle
view, click on one of your

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:10.326 A:middle
commits, and select "tag," and

00:10:10.326 --> 00:10:11.556 A:middle
you'll see this new pane to

00:10:11.556 --> 00:10:12.256 A:middle
create your tag.

00:10:13.536 --> 00:10:14.606 A:middle
Now based on the naming

00:10:14.606 --> 00:10:16.726 A:middle
conventions of your tag, by

00:10:16.726 --> 00:10:19.106 A:middle
using forward slashes, Xcode

00:10:19.106 --> 00:10:20.766 A:middle
will automatically group your

00:10:20.766 --> 00:10:22.856 A:middle
tags to help organize them

00:10:22.856 --> 00:10:23.226 A:middle
easier.

00:10:24.026 --> 00:10:25.056 A:middle
This makes it easier to look

00:10:25.056 --> 00:10:26.796 A:middle
them up later and in this case

00:10:27.096 --> 00:10:28.016 A:middle
we're going to create a beta's

00:10:28.016 --> 00:10:28.346 A:middle
group.

00:10:29.066 --> 00:10:30.616 A:middle
And when you create your tag it

00:10:30.906 --> 00:10:32.466 A:middle
will immediately appear in the

00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:34.286 A:middle
new history view so you can see

00:10:34.286 --> 00:10:35.086 A:middle
that point in time.

00:10:36.616 --> 00:10:37.916 A:middle
If we flip open the "tags"

00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:40.386 A:middle
folder you'll see those tags.

00:10:41.246 --> 00:10:42.896 A:middle
By selecting the Beta 4 tag here

00:10:42.896 --> 00:10:44.916 A:middle
I see only the history of that

00:10:44.916 --> 00:10:45.000 A:middle
tag.

00:10:46.226 --> 00:10:47.436 A:middle
And you might wonder; why is

00:10:47.436 --> 00:10:48.166 A:middle
that useful?

00:10:48.166 --> 00:10:49.526 A:middle
To see just the history of that

00:10:49.526 --> 00:10:49.626 A:middle
tag?

00:10:49.886 --> 00:10:51.816 A:middle
Well, it lets you find precisely

00:10:51.816 --> 00:10:53.886 A:middle
what changes and features were

00:10:53.886 --> 00:10:55.426 A:middle
introduced in a particular

00:10:55.426 --> 00:10:56.236 A:middle
version of your app.

00:10:56.616 --> 00:10:57.936 A:middle
And by using the new searching

00:10:57.936 --> 00:10:59.986 A:middle
and filtering capabilities you

00:10:59.986 --> 00:11:00.816 A:middle
can find them easier.

00:10:59.986 --> 00:11:00.816 A:middle
can find them easier.

00:11:02.076 --> 00:11:03.386 A:middle
So I've been told there was a

00:11:03.386 --> 00:11:05.536 A:middle
bug introduced and it was in

00:11:05.536 --> 00:11:06.296 A:middle
Beta 3.

00:11:07.036 --> 00:11:08.326 A:middle
So I go to the new navigator and

00:11:08.326 --> 00:11:10.706 A:middle
I select the Beta 3 tag and I

00:11:10.706 --> 00:11:12.816 A:middle
see here that only two changes

00:11:12.816 --> 00:11:14.086 A:middle
were made since the last Beta.

00:11:14.126 --> 00:11:16.096 A:middle
One was by Eric; one was by me.

00:11:16.096 --> 00:11:18.386 A:middle
And this top one here, it's

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:20.366 A:middle
looking you know particularly

00:11:20.366 --> 00:11:21.716 A:middle
sketchy and I'm not sure if it's

00:11:21.716 --> 00:11:22.746 A:middle
something to do with the author.

00:11:22.956 --> 00:11:24.486 A:middle
At this point they cease to

00:11:24.486 --> 00:11:26.036 A:middle
become avatars and instead

00:11:26.036 --> 00:11:26.596 A:middle
become mugshots.

00:11:26.596 --> 00:11:30.116 A:middle
So I select this guy and I

00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:33.746 A:middle
double click on him and I see

00:11:33.746 --> 00:11:34.636 A:middle
this new view.

00:11:34.636 --> 00:11:36.646 A:middle
Now you might be familiar with

00:11:36.646 --> 00:11:38.226 A:middle
this view in previous versions

00:11:38.226 --> 00:11:38.726 A:middle
of Xcode.

00:11:38.956 --> 00:11:40.916 A:middle
It used to display as a sheet.

00:11:40.916 --> 00:11:42.716 A:middle
The problem with that though was

00:11:42.716 --> 00:11:44.046 A:middle
it blocked your workflow.

00:11:44.446 --> 00:11:45.766 A:middle
With this you can open a new

00:11:45.766 --> 00:11:47.866 A:middle
tab, carry on working as usual.

00:11:47.866 --> 00:11:49.856 A:middle
And with the rich assistance

00:11:49.856 --> 00:11:51.336 A:middle
support, which Eric's going to

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:53.296 A:middle
show us later, we'll see how

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:54.936 A:middle
easy it is to review your

00:11:54.936 --> 00:11:56.026 A:middle
changes in your code.

00:11:57.206 --> 00:11:58.326 A:middle
So here we can see there's a

00:11:58.416 --> 00:11:59.546 A:middle
force [inaudible] that I wrote,

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:01.626 A:middle
which can crash the app of

00:12:01.726 --> 00:12:02.106 A:middle
course.

00:12:03.216 --> 00:12:05.406 A:middle
This new editor is really great

00:12:05.406 --> 00:12:06.206 A:middle
for other reasons too.

00:12:06.246 --> 00:12:07.696 A:middle
For example there's full jumper

00:12:07.696 --> 00:12:10.716 A:middle
support so you can navigate your

00:12:10.716 --> 00:12:11.986 A:middle
files really quickly.

00:12:12.276 --> 00:12:13.436 A:middle
You can collapse that list of

00:12:13.436 --> 00:12:15.316 A:middle
files for more screen space as

00:12:15.316 --> 00:12:15.606 A:middle
well.

00:12:15.606 --> 00:12:17.096 A:middle
And at the bottom you have that

00:12:17.096 --> 00:12:18.456 A:middle
detail pane, just so you know

00:12:18.456 --> 00:12:19.266 A:middle
you're looking at the right

00:12:19.266 --> 00:12:19.500 A:middle
commit.

00:12:21.746 --> 00:12:23.696 A:middle
So that's the all new tagging

00:12:23.696 --> 00:12:25.566 A:middle
experience in Xcode 9.

00:12:27.036 --> 00:12:28.576 A:middle
So combining the new, current

00:12:28.576 --> 00:12:30.766 A:middle
experience the new source

00:12:30.766 --> 00:12:33.206 A:middle
control navigator, and the great

00:12:33.206 --> 00:12:35.146 A:middle
new workflows around branching

00:12:35.146 --> 00:12:37.126 A:middle
and tags makes it easier than

00:12:37.126 --> 00:12:39.016 A:middle
ever to get real work done with

00:12:39.016 --> 00:12:40.386 A:middle
source control and Xcode 9.

00:12:41.276 --> 00:12:42.356 A:middle
So with that I'd like to

00:12:42.356 --> 00:12:43.616 A:middle
introduce Eric [inaudible] to

00:12:43.616 --> 00:12:44.776 A:middle
the stage to show us some of

00:12:44.776 --> 00:12:45.546 A:middle
these new features.

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:51.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:52.396 --> 00:12:53.306 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Kieran.

00:12:54.256 --> 00:12:55.716 A:middle
So as he said, I'm going to show

00:12:55.716 --> 00:12:56.966 A:middle
you some of the new features of

00:12:57.046 --> 00:12:58.486 A:middle
Xcode 9 and source control.

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:01.176 A:middle
So I've just set up this machine

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:01.176 A:middle
So I've just set up this machine

00:13:01.846 --> 00:13:03.196 A:middle
and I've installed Xcode 9 on

00:13:03.196 --> 00:13:04.566 A:middle
it, but I don't have any of my

00:13:04.566 --> 00:13:05.296 A:middle
projects yet.

00:13:05.296 --> 00:13:07.476 A:middle
I want to clone them from GitHub

00:13:07.476 --> 00:13:08.706 A:middle
and in order to do that I'm

00:13:08.706 --> 00:13:10.576 A:middle
going to need to sign into my

00:13:10.576 --> 00:13:11.236 A:middle
GitHub account.

00:13:11.236 --> 00:13:13.716 A:middle
So I'll just go to Xcode's

00:13:13.716 --> 00:13:15.806 A:middle
preferences and to the

00:13:15.806 --> 00:13:16.556 A:middle
"accounts" pane.

00:13:17.466 --> 00:13:18.626 A:middle
And here we see of course I have

00:13:18.626 --> 00:13:19.246 A:middle
no accounts.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:21.536 A:middle
So if I just go to the plus

00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:24.816 A:middle
button in the lower left I get

00:13:24.816 --> 00:13:26.136 A:middle
an option to add any account

00:13:26.136 --> 00:13:27.586 A:middle
that Xcode supports, such as my

00:13:27.586 --> 00:13:29.036 A:middle
Apple ID for doing provisioning

00:13:29.036 --> 00:13:30.926 A:middle
and signing, Xcode Server for

00:13:30.926 --> 00:13:32.536 A:middle
continuous integration, or

00:13:32.536 --> 00:13:33.736 A:middle
GitHub for source control.

00:13:33.736 --> 00:13:35.996 A:middle
And I want to take a moment here

00:13:35.996 --> 00:13:36.966 A:middle
and point out that we also

00:13:36.966 --> 00:13:38.416 A:middle
support GitHub Enterprise.

00:13:38.456 --> 00:13:40.396 A:middle
So if your company uses a GitHub

00:13:40.396 --> 00:13:41.916 A:middle
Enterprise server all the

00:13:41.916 --> 00:13:42.826 A:middle
features that we're showing you

00:13:42.826 --> 00:13:44.516 A:middle
that work with GitHub work just

00:13:44.516 --> 00:13:45.776 A:middle
as well with GitHub Enterprise

00:13:45.886 --> 00:13:46.956 A:middle
on your own company's server.

00:13:47.986 --> 00:13:49.756 A:middle
But for today, I'm just going to

00:13:49.756 --> 00:13:50.716 A:middle
use github.com.

00:13:51.276 --> 00:13:57.786 A:middle
Great, so I'm going to sign in

00:13:57.786 --> 00:13:59.186 A:middle
and copy my password.

00:13:59.186 --> 00:14:00.916 A:middle
Make sure that goes in the

00:13:59.186 --> 00:14:00.916 A:middle
Make sure that goes in the

00:14:00.916 --> 00:14:01.586 A:middle
password field.

00:14:01.666 --> 00:14:03.566 A:middle
[laughs] And I use two factor

00:14:03.566 --> 00:14:04.296 A:middle
authentication.

00:14:04.716 --> 00:14:06.316 A:middle
And Xcode 9 supports two factor

00:14:06.316 --> 00:14:07.656 A:middle
authentication with GitHub.

00:14:07.736 --> 00:14:08.786 A:middle
This is a great way to secure

00:14:08.786 --> 00:14:10.126 A:middle
your account and make sure that

00:14:10.126 --> 00:14:11.716 A:middle
only you can access your source

00:14:11.776 --> 00:14:11.976 A:middle
code.

00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:20.596 A:middle
Great! So I've signed into Xcode

00:14:20.706 --> 00:14:22.886 A:middle
-- or into GitHub in Xcode and

00:14:22.886 --> 00:14:23.646 A:middle
we see that Xcode has

00:14:23.646 --> 00:14:25.856 A:middle
automatically detected my SSH

00:14:25.886 --> 00:14:26.576 A:middle
keys.

00:14:27.246 --> 00:14:29.306 A:middle
So I can clone using either

00:14:29.386 --> 00:14:30.876 A:middle
HTTPS or SSH, whichever I

00:14:30.876 --> 00:14:31.276 A:middle
prefer.

00:14:32.276 --> 00:14:33.586 A:middle
I'm going to leave it set to

00:14:33.586 --> 00:14:35.556 A:middle
HTTPS, but before I go clone

00:14:35.556 --> 00:14:36.866 A:middle
anything let me just go to my

00:14:36.866 --> 00:14:37.836 A:middle
source control preferences and

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:39.086 A:middle
make sure everything is set up

00:14:39.086 --> 00:14:40.266 A:middle
exactly the way I want.

00:14:40.786 --> 00:14:43.046 A:middle
So here if I go to source

00:14:43.046 --> 00:14:44.766 A:middle
control I see that I have source

00:14:44.766 --> 00:14:46.056 A:middle
control enabled and if I go

00:14:46.056 --> 00:14:47.016 A:middle
specifically to the "get"

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:48.806 A:middle
settings we see that new in

00:14:48.836 --> 00:14:50.636 A:middle
Xcode 9 you can now configure

00:14:50.636 --> 00:14:52.016 A:middle
your "get author" and your

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:53.596 A:middle
"globally ignored" files right

00:14:53.596 --> 00:14:54.206 A:middle
in Xcode.

00:14:55.206 --> 00:14:56.926 A:middle
So your get author, your user

00:14:56.926 --> 00:14:59.386 A:middle
name, and email are what people

00:14:59.386 --> 00:15:01.706 A:middle
will see when you make commits.

00:14:59.386 --> 00:15:01.706 A:middle
will see when you make commits.

00:15:01.786 --> 00:15:03.056 A:middle
So they'll know who to go to

00:15:03.056 --> 00:15:04.046 A:middle
when they find a bug on that

00:15:04.046 --> 00:15:04.386 A:middle
line.

00:15:06.046 --> 00:15:07.226 A:middle
So I think I'm all set up here.

00:15:07.726 --> 00:15:08.776 A:middle
So let's go back to the welcome

00:15:08.776 --> 00:15:09.106 A:middle
window.

00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:10.766 A:middle
And to get to that new clone

00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:12.236 A:middle
window we saw earlier I just go

00:15:12.236 --> 00:15:13.466 A:middle
straight to "clone an existing

00:15:13.466 --> 00:15:14.806 A:middle
project" right from the welcome

00:15:14.806 --> 00:15:16.936 A:middle
window and immediately it

00:15:16.936 --> 00:15:18.126 A:middle
populates with a list of

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.116 A:middle
projects that I might be

00:15:19.116 --> 00:15:19.816 A:middle
interested in.

00:15:20.526 --> 00:15:21.816 A:middle
Now this is all the projects

00:15:21.846 --> 00:15:23.016 A:middle
that I own and maintain on

00:15:23.016 --> 00:15:25.286 A:middle
GitHub as well as any projects

00:15:25.286 --> 00:15:26.746 A:middle
that I've starred on GitHub and

00:15:26.806 --> 00:15:28.146 A:middle
indicated that I have some

00:15:28.146 --> 00:15:28.686 A:middle
interest in.

00:15:29.166 --> 00:15:30.936 A:middle
Additionally, if I'm a member of

00:15:30.936 --> 00:15:32.886 A:middle
any organization that has

00:15:32.886 --> 00:15:35.076 A:middle
repositories on GitHub, such as

00:15:35.076 --> 00:15:37.106 A:middle
the Apple organization here, I

00:15:37.106 --> 00:15:38.566 A:middle
can see those repositories as

00:15:38.566 --> 00:15:38.866 A:middle
well.

00:15:40.496 --> 00:15:41.526 A:middle
Now if this isn't what I'm

00:15:41.526 --> 00:15:43.256 A:middle
looking for I can just search.

00:15:43.316 --> 00:15:44.876 A:middle
So Kieran was telling me earlier

00:15:44.876 --> 00:15:46.216 A:middle
that I should really check out

00:15:46.216 --> 00:15:46.916 A:middle
research kit.

00:15:47.456 --> 00:15:49.046 A:middle
Research kit is Apple's open

00:15:49.046 --> 00:15:51.156 A:middle
source framework for creating

00:15:51.156 --> 00:15:52.546 A:middle
medical research applications

00:15:52.546 --> 00:15:53.606 A:middle
and it's available on GitHub.

00:15:53.936 --> 00:15:56.856 A:middle
So I'll just search research kit

00:15:56.856 --> 00:15:58.686 A:middle
and I'll put that into the

00:15:58.686 --> 00:16:00.246 A:middle
search field and sure enough

00:15:58.686 --> 00:16:00.246 A:middle
search field and sure enough

00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:02.516 A:middle
what comes back is research kit.

00:16:03.266 --> 00:16:04.556 A:middle
And if I'm not sure this is the

00:16:04.556 --> 00:16:05.676 A:middle
one I'm looking for I get a

00:16:05.676 --> 00:16:07.076 A:middle
little bit more information in

00:16:07.076 --> 00:16:07.736 A:middle
the detail view.

00:16:08.166 --> 00:16:09.776 A:middle
So if we zoom in on that we see

00:16:10.226 --> 00:16:11.486 A:middle
I get the full name and if I

00:16:11.486 --> 00:16:12.566 A:middle
click that I can go right to the

00:16:12.566 --> 00:16:13.676 A:middle
GitHub page for it.

00:16:14.526 --> 00:16:15.466 A:middle
But usually everything I need's

00:16:15.466 --> 00:16:15.946 A:middle
right here.

00:16:15.946 --> 00:16:17.516 A:middle
I get the description, the

00:16:17.516 --> 00:16:19.226 A:middle
language, the number of people

00:16:19.226 --> 00:16:21.246 A:middle
who have forked the project, how

00:16:21.246 --> 00:16:22.366 A:middle
many people have starred the

00:16:22.366 --> 00:16:24.626 A:middle
project, and the read me for the

00:16:24.626 --> 00:16:25.126 A:middle
project.

00:16:25.736 --> 00:16:26.876 A:middle
So if I click the read me you

00:16:27.266 --> 00:16:29.816 A:middle
get the read me file that this

00:16:29.816 --> 00:16:31.706 A:middle
project provides on GitHub and

00:16:31.706 --> 00:16:32.886 A:middle
usually this has information

00:16:32.886 --> 00:16:34.256 A:middle
like a bit more about the

00:16:34.256 --> 00:16:36.336 A:middle
project or how to get started

00:16:36.336 --> 00:16:38.286 A:middle
with it and even some sample

00:16:38.286 --> 00:16:38.566 A:middle
code.

00:16:38.836 --> 00:16:39.696 A:middle
And one of the great things is

00:16:39.696 --> 00:16:41.056 A:middle
since a lot of these are written

00:16:41.056 --> 00:16:42.866 A:middle
in markdown, when you do clone a

00:16:42.866 --> 00:16:44.696 A:middle
project they work great in

00:16:44.696 --> 00:16:46.356 A:middle
Xcode's new enhanced markdown

00:16:46.356 --> 00:16:48.236 A:middle
support in our source editor.

00:16:48.236 --> 00:16:51.706 A:middle
So that is the one I want so

00:16:51.706 --> 00:16:52.776 A:middle
I'll go ahead and star it.

00:16:53.476 --> 00:16:54.566 A:middle
And so right in Xcode when I

00:16:54.566 --> 00:16:56.236 A:middle
click the star button we see the

00:16:56.236 --> 00:16:57.896 A:middle
star count incremented because

00:16:57.896 --> 00:16:58.756 A:middle
I'm now starring this

00:16:58.756 --> 00:16:59.386 A:middle
repository.

00:16:59.976 --> 00:17:03.226 A:middle
And if I clear out my search we

00:16:59.976 --> 00:17:03.226 A:middle
And if I clear out my search we

00:17:03.226 --> 00:17:05.066 A:middle
see that sure enough, right in

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.866 A:middle
my default view I see research

00:17:06.866 --> 00:17:07.246 A:middle
kit now.

00:17:07.486 --> 00:17:09.326 A:middle
So every machine I sign into I

00:17:09.326 --> 00:17:10.566 A:middle
can easily get back to research

00:17:10.566 --> 00:17:11.596 A:middle
kit if I want to check that out

00:17:11.596 --> 00:17:12.236 A:middle
a little bit later.

00:17:13.106 --> 00:17:14.786 A:middle
But today I want to check out

00:17:14.786 --> 00:17:15.786 A:middle
that TOTP app.

00:17:15.786 --> 00:17:18.076 A:middle
So TOTP is a onetime password

00:17:18.076 --> 00:17:18.546 A:middle
generator.

00:17:18.606 --> 00:17:19.566 A:middle
It's actually the app you saw me

00:17:19.566 --> 00:17:20.766 A:middle
use a little bit earlier to sign

00:17:20.766 --> 00:17:21.326 A:middle
in to GitHub.

00:17:21.326 --> 00:17:24.685 A:middle
So I'll just clone that and

00:17:24.685 --> 00:17:26.066 A:middle
right away I can save it to my

00:17:26.066 --> 00:17:26.796 A:middle
documents folder.

00:17:27.715 --> 00:17:29.816 A:middle
And that's it.

00:17:29.816 --> 00:17:31.436 A:middle
It's super simple in Xcode 9 to

00:17:31.436 --> 00:17:32.596 A:middle
clone projects from GitHub.

00:17:32.826 --> 00:17:34.126 A:middle
There's no more off prompts or

00:17:34.126 --> 00:17:35.176 A:middle
any choices you have to make

00:17:35.176 --> 00:17:36.316 A:middle
once you've selected a project.

00:17:36.896 --> 00:17:39.666 A:middle
And immediately upon cloning

00:17:39.866 --> 00:17:41.156 A:middle
Xcode will open the project and

00:17:41.156 --> 00:17:42.586 A:middle
you get a very familiar view.

00:17:42.786 --> 00:17:44.296 A:middle
You get your project navigator

00:17:44.996 --> 00:17:46.196 A:middle
and your editor area.

00:17:46.196 --> 00:17:47.876 A:middle
And if we look over in the left,

00:17:47.876 --> 00:17:49.526 A:middle
sure enough next to the project

00:17:49.526 --> 00:17:51.326 A:middle
navigator we see the new source

00:17:51.326 --> 00:17:52.126 A:middle
control navigator.

00:17:53.526 --> 00:17:54.576 A:middle
So this automatically gets

00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:56.086 A:middle
populated with every working

00:17:56.086 --> 00:17:57.936 A:middle
copy that makes up your project.

00:17:58.336 --> 00:17:59.826 A:middle
In this case I only have one;

00:17:59.886 --> 00:18:01.936 A:middle
the TOTP working copy.

00:17:59.886 --> 00:18:01.936 A:middle
the TOTP working copy.

00:18:02.716 --> 00:18:03.976 A:middle
And I see the one branch that I

00:18:03.976 --> 00:18:05.156 A:middle
automatically cloned when I

00:18:05.156 --> 00:18:06.716 A:middle
cloned from GitHub Master.

00:18:07.296 --> 00:18:09.706 A:middle
If I select "master" I instantly

00:18:09.706 --> 00:18:10.776 A:middle
get the full history of the

00:18:10.776 --> 00:18:11.286 A:middle
project.

00:18:12.076 --> 00:18:13.106 A:middle
And here we see all the commits

00:18:13.106 --> 00:18:14.386 A:middle
that make up this project and

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:15.276 A:middle
make it what it is.

00:18:16.146 --> 00:18:19.106 A:middle
Now Kieran was showing something

00:18:19.106 --> 00:18:20.386 A:middle
a little bit earlier that looked

00:18:20.386 --> 00:18:21.326 A:middle
like a bug and we should

00:18:21.326 --> 00:18:23.766 A:middle
probably fix that before we move

00:18:23.766 --> 00:18:24.066 A:middle
on.

00:18:25.516 --> 00:18:26.636 A:middle
So I need to find that.

00:18:26.636 --> 00:18:27.886 A:middle
So I saw that it was made by

00:18:27.886 --> 00:18:28.406 A:middle
Kieran.

00:18:29.996 --> 00:18:31.086 A:middle
So I'll just say, "author;

00:18:31.086 --> 00:18:31.436 A:middle
Kieran."

00:18:32.456 --> 00:18:33.326 A:middle
And here's all the commits

00:18:33.326 --> 00:18:34.046 A:middle
Kieran's made.

00:18:34.836 --> 00:18:35.966 A:middle
And I think it had something to

00:18:35.966 --> 00:18:37.846 A:middle
do with the generator, if I saw

00:18:37.846 --> 00:18:38.316 A:middle
correctly.

00:18:38.316 --> 00:18:39.196 A:middle
So I think it was something

00:18:39.196 --> 00:18:40.246 A:middle
where in the message he said,

00:18:40.936 --> 00:18:41.386 A:middle
"Generator."

00:18:42.176 --> 00:18:43.816 A:middle
Generator -- sorry.

00:18:44.606 --> 00:18:45.446 A:middle
Ah, that's the one.

00:18:46.596 --> 00:18:48.686 A:middle
And if I select it I get a lot

00:18:48.686 --> 00:18:50.336 A:middle
of extra information about that

00:18:50.336 --> 00:18:50.616 A:middle
commit.

00:18:50.996 --> 00:18:51.936 A:middle
So in addition to a new source

00:18:51.936 --> 00:18:53.386 A:middle
control navigator, a new source

00:18:53.386 --> 00:18:55.116 A:middle
control history view, we also

00:18:55.116 --> 00:18:55.936 A:middle
have a new source control

00:18:55.936 --> 00:18:56.636 A:middle
inspector.

00:18:56.966 --> 00:18:58.476 A:middle
And in the inspector, when I

00:18:58.476 --> 00:19:00.066 A:middle
select a commit I get additional

00:18:58.476 --> 00:19:00.066 A:middle
select a commit I get additional

00:19:00.066 --> 00:19:01.626 A:middle
information about that commit

00:19:02.286 --> 00:19:04.886 A:middle
such as the full shaw, the exact

00:19:04.956 --> 00:19:07.046 A:middle
commit date and time, the

00:19:07.046 --> 00:19:09.316 A:middle
author, as well as the full

00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:10.066 A:middle
commit message.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.826 A:middle
I can also see the files that

00:19:11.826 --> 00:19:13.236 A:middle
were modified in that commit.

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:14.726 A:middle
And if I want to review the

00:19:14.726 --> 00:19:16.096 A:middle
changes made to any file in that

00:19:16.096 --> 00:19:17.916 A:middle
commit I can click this arrow

00:19:17.916 --> 00:19:19.076 A:middle
and go straight to them.

00:19:19.606 --> 00:19:21.526 A:middle
But as Kieran mentioned earlier,

00:19:21.526 --> 00:19:22.786 A:middle
there's an even better way than

00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:24.286 A:middle
just double clicking or clicking

00:19:24.286 --> 00:19:25.726 A:middle
this arrow to get to the dif,

00:19:25.796 --> 00:19:26.806 A:middle
and that's to make use of

00:19:26.806 --> 00:19:27.926 A:middle
Xcode's assistant editor.

00:19:28.556 --> 00:19:29.966 A:middle
So many of you may be familiar

00:19:29.966 --> 00:19:31.366 A:middle
with Xcode's assistant editor,

00:19:31.366 --> 00:19:32.976 A:middle
but probably have seen it mostly

00:19:32.976 --> 00:19:33.466 A:middle
on the right.

00:19:33.836 --> 00:19:35.506 A:middle
Now I want a little bit of extra

00:19:35.706 --> 00:19:37.566 A:middle
horizontal space to view dif sen

00:19:38.096 --> 00:19:39.286 A:middle
so if I click and hold on the

00:19:39.286 --> 00:19:41.236 A:middle
"assistant editor" button I can

00:19:41.236 --> 00:19:42.186 A:middle
select to have the assistant

00:19:42.186 --> 00:19:43.036 A:middle
editor on the bottom.

00:19:43.536 --> 00:19:45.016 A:middle
And when it opens it

00:19:45.066 --> 00:19:46.806 A:middle
automatically shows the commit

00:19:46.806 --> 00:19:47.856 A:middle
details for the commit I have

00:19:47.856 --> 00:19:48.866 A:middle
selected above.

00:19:48.866 --> 00:19:50.626 A:middle
So this is great.

00:19:50.626 --> 00:19:51.986 A:middle
I can go right to the change

00:19:51.986 --> 00:19:53.266 A:middle
that Kieran made and sure

00:19:53.266 --> 00:19:53.976 A:middle
enough, there it is.

00:19:54.236 --> 00:19:55.756 A:middle
Uh, well we should probably fix

00:19:55.756 --> 00:19:55.936 A:middle
that.

00:19:57.016 --> 00:19:57.916 A:middle
While I'm here, let me just show

00:19:57.916 --> 00:19:59.176 A:middle
you -- so even if I want to look

00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:01.446 A:middle
at some other commits they show

00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:01.446 A:middle
at some other commits they show

00:20:01.446 --> 00:20:01.656 A:middle
up.

00:20:01.656 --> 00:20:02.806 A:middle
The second I click them I get

00:20:02.806 --> 00:20:03.776 A:middle
all the files and all the

00:20:03.776 --> 00:20:05.016 A:middle
changes made in those commits.

00:20:05.586 --> 00:20:07.636 A:middle
So let's close the assistant

00:20:07.636 --> 00:20:11.886 A:middle
editor and go over to the app

00:20:11.886 --> 00:20:12.916 A:middle
delegate, where I think that

00:20:12.916 --> 00:20:14.686 A:middle
change was that broke it.

00:20:15.206 --> 00:20:15.866 A:middle
Ah, here it is.

00:20:16.416 --> 00:20:18.826 A:middle
So I'll just go ahead and fix

00:20:18.886 --> 00:20:19.586 A:middle
that.

00:20:20.236 --> 00:20:23.326 A:middle
Great. I love magical code

00:20:23.326 --> 00:20:24.516 A:middle
completion that fixes bugs.

00:20:26.606 --> 00:20:28.316 A:middle
And I would normally just commit

00:20:28.316 --> 00:20:30.106 A:middle
this right onto master and be

00:20:30.106 --> 00:20:31.466 A:middle
done with it, but I think this

00:20:31.466 --> 00:20:32.606 A:middle
change should use -- could use a

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:33.666 A:middle
little bit more testing to make

00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:34.646 A:middle
sure we've actually fixed this

00:20:34.686 --> 00:20:36.226 A:middle
bug because I want to be sure.

00:20:37.306 --> 00:20:38.486 A:middle
So if we go back to the source

00:20:38.486 --> 00:20:40.416 A:middle
control navigator and I select

00:20:40.416 --> 00:20:41.916 A:middle
my master branch and control

00:20:41.916 --> 00:20:44.696 A:middle
click it I can create a new

00:20:44.696 --> 00:20:45.876 A:middle
branch from master.

00:20:46.456 --> 00:20:49.226 A:middle
And this new branch I'll just

00:20:49.226 --> 00:20:51.446 A:middle
call "fix" because I don't have

00:20:51.446 --> 00:20:52.526 A:middle
any good names.

00:20:53.466 --> 00:20:54.406 A:middle
[laughs] So this now

00:20:54.406 --> 00:20:56.226 A:middle
automatically got checked out by

00:20:56.226 --> 00:20:58.106 A:middle
Xcode and all my uncommitted

00:20:58.106 --> 00:20:59.606 A:middle
changes are now sitting on top

00:20:59.606 --> 00:21:00.646 A:middle
of the fix branch.

00:20:59.606 --> 00:21:00.646 A:middle
of the fix branch.

00:21:02.196 --> 00:21:03.696 A:middle
So with that I'm ready to

00:21:03.696 --> 00:21:04.026 A:middle
commit.

00:21:04.026 --> 00:21:06.326 A:middle
And to do that I just go to

00:21:06.326 --> 00:21:07.666 A:middle
source control and select

00:21:08.336 --> 00:21:09.886 A:middle
"commit" and make sure my dif is

00:21:09.886 --> 00:21:10.336 A:middle
correct.

00:21:10.846 --> 00:21:14.000 A:middle
Let's see, "fixes a crash."

00:21:15.856 --> 00:21:15.976 A:middle
Great.

00:21:16.506 --> 00:21:17.396 A:middle
So now that is one of those

00:21:17.396 --> 00:21:18.796 A:middle
commits that make up the history

00:21:18.796 --> 00:21:19.496 A:middle
of my project.

00:21:20.136 --> 00:21:21.966 A:middle
And I can verify that if I go to

00:21:21.966 --> 00:21:23.586 A:middle
the "fix" branch in the source

00:21:23.586 --> 00:21:24.456 A:middle
control navigator.

00:21:24.836 --> 00:21:25.786 A:middle
Here we see that brand new

00:21:25.786 --> 00:21:27.286 A:middle
commit I just created today.

00:21:27.966 --> 00:21:29.626 A:middle
Now one of the things that I

00:21:29.626 --> 00:21:31.016 A:middle
often find when I'm making

00:21:31.016 --> 00:21:32.296 A:middle
branches and committing things

00:21:32.296 --> 00:21:33.406 A:middle
is that I forget what commits

00:21:33.406 --> 00:21:34.356 A:middle
are on what branches and I

00:21:34.356 --> 00:21:36.006 A:middle
easily lose track of them and

00:21:36.006 --> 00:21:37.236 A:middle
it's really annoying to have to

00:21:37.236 --> 00:21:38.286 A:middle
figure out whether or not a

00:21:38.286 --> 00:21:39.596 A:middle
commit you've made landed in the

00:21:39.596 --> 00:21:40.256 A:middle
right branch.

00:21:40.976 --> 00:21:42.606 A:middle
Well Xcode 9 has a great way to

00:21:42.606 --> 00:21:43.246 A:middle
figure that out.

00:21:43.786 --> 00:21:46.276 A:middle
If I select my commit and zoom

00:21:46.276 --> 00:21:47.926 A:middle
in here on the inspector we see

00:21:47.926 --> 00:21:49.396 A:middle
that there's a branches area.

00:21:49.396 --> 00:21:51.566 A:middle
And right now the only branches

00:21:51.566 --> 00:21:53.866 A:middle
listed for that commit is "fix."

00:21:54.296 --> 00:21:55.436 A:middle
So this particular commit is

00:21:55.486 --> 00:21:56.926 A:middle
only in the fix branch.

00:21:58.106 --> 00:21:59.376 A:middle
If I go back and look at an

00:21:59.376 --> 00:22:02.136 A:middle
older commit, now if we look at

00:21:59.376 --> 00:22:02.136 A:middle
older commit, now if we look at

00:22:02.136 --> 00:22:03.516 A:middle
it this commit is a bit older

00:22:03.516 --> 00:22:04.826 A:middle
and was before I branched.

00:22:05.216 --> 00:22:06.476 A:middle
So it's actually in both the

00:22:06.476 --> 00:22:08.106 A:middle
"fix" branch and the master

00:22:08.106 --> 00:22:08.566 A:middle
branch.

00:22:08.786 --> 00:22:09.766 A:middle
So this is a great way to figure

00:22:09.766 --> 00:22:10.906 A:middle
out exactly where your commits

00:22:10.906 --> 00:22:12.336 A:middle
are and know exactly what you're

00:22:12.336 --> 00:22:13.506 A:middle
shipping to your customers.

00:22:14.876 --> 00:22:16.686 A:middle
Now normally I create an Xcode

00:22:16.686 --> 00:22:18.436 A:middle
server bot to integrate this and

00:22:18.436 --> 00:22:19.726 A:middle
some unit tests and all that,

00:22:19.726 --> 00:22:21.536 A:middle
but since I just got a thousand

00:22:21.536 --> 00:22:23.326 A:middle
of my closest friends here to

00:22:23.326 --> 00:22:25.556 A:middle
code review my change I'm going

00:22:25.556 --> 00:22:27.136 A:middle
to just merge it into master.

00:22:27.806 --> 00:22:29.516 A:middle
So again, if I control click

00:22:29.516 --> 00:22:32.206 A:middle
"master" in the navigator I can

00:22:32.206 --> 00:22:34.386 A:middle
merge from "fix" into "master"

00:22:35.016 --> 00:22:37.966 A:middle
and in one step I have merged my

00:22:37.966 --> 00:22:39.606 A:middle
fix into master and switched to

00:22:39.606 --> 00:22:41.896 A:middle
the master branch super easily

00:22:41.896 --> 00:22:42.606 A:middle
from the source control

00:22:42.606 --> 00:22:43.186 A:middle
navigator.

00:22:43.776 --> 00:22:44.626 A:middle
And sure enough, the history

00:22:44.626 --> 00:22:44.976 A:middle
view updates.

00:22:45.516 --> 00:22:50.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:51.046 --> 00:22:52.766 A:middle
This review updates and I can

00:22:52.766 --> 00:22:55.506 A:middle
see that my fix is now on the

00:22:55.506 --> 00:22:56.996 A:middle
master branch as well as "fix."

00:22:57.076 --> 00:22:59.196 A:middle
And if we zoom in over here, if

00:22:59.196 --> 00:23:00.376 A:middle
I need to confirm that indeed

00:22:59.196 --> 00:23:00.376 A:middle
I need to confirm that indeed

00:23:00.376 --> 00:23:01.836 A:middle
this change made it to master,

00:23:02.326 --> 00:23:03.446 A:middle
the master branch is listed.

00:23:05.426 --> 00:23:06.916 A:middle
Now this was a crash that was

00:23:06.916 --> 00:23:08.476 A:middle
affecting a lot of our users so

00:23:08.476 --> 00:23:09.416 A:middle
I want to make sure we get this

00:23:09.416 --> 00:23:10.376 A:middle
app out quickly.

00:23:10.566 --> 00:23:11.606 A:middle
So I'm going to tag it.

00:23:12.266 --> 00:23:13.546 A:middle
And if I control click on a

00:23:13.546 --> 00:23:14.716 A:middle
commit we see that there's a

00:23:14.716 --> 00:23:15.986 A:middle
bunch of actions I can do on a

00:23:15.986 --> 00:23:16.956 A:middle
commit as well.

00:23:16.956 --> 00:23:18.696 A:middle
So just like you can do actions

00:23:18.696 --> 00:23:20.406 A:middle
on a branch in Xcode 9, you can

00:23:20.406 --> 00:23:21.586 A:middle
do particular actions on a

00:23:21.586 --> 00:23:23.686 A:middle
commit such as checking out or

00:23:23.686 --> 00:23:24.876 A:middle
branching even from an older

00:23:24.876 --> 00:23:25.536 A:middle
point in time.

00:23:26.796 --> 00:23:28.756 A:middle
But today I'm going to tag this

00:23:28.756 --> 00:23:30.066 A:middle
commit so that we know which one

00:23:30.066 --> 00:23:31.266 A:middle
we want to release as Version

00:23:31.266 --> 00:23:31.946 A:middle
1.2.

00:23:33.536 --> 00:23:35.676 A:middle
So I'll select "tag" and select

00:23:35.676 --> 00:23:41.916 A:middle
"releases/v1.2" and create that

00:23:41.916 --> 00:23:42.176 A:middle
tag.

00:23:42.266 --> 00:23:43.586 A:middle
And there we go.

00:23:43.586 --> 00:23:45.446 A:middle
As soon as I do that the tag is

00:23:45.446 --> 00:23:46.926 A:middle
automatically upended to that

00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:47.296 A:middle
commit.

00:23:48.156 --> 00:23:49.826 A:middle
And I can verify that in the

00:23:49.826 --> 00:23:51.946 A:middle
"tags" folder of the source

00:23:51.946 --> 00:23:52.756 A:middle
control navigator.

00:23:53.246 --> 00:23:54.086 A:middle
And because I've been using

00:23:54.086 --> 00:23:56.286 A:middle
slashes and names to prefix all

00:23:56.286 --> 00:23:58.346 A:middle
my tags we see Xcode creates an

00:23:58.346 --> 00:24:00.696 A:middle
automatic hierarchy for me in

00:23:58.346 --> 00:24:00.696 A:middle
automatic hierarchy for me in

00:24:00.696 --> 00:24:02.166 A:middle
the navigator, making it super

00:24:02.166 --> 00:24:03.646 A:middle
easy to organize my project.

00:24:04.366 --> 00:24:06.186 A:middle
So we'll get that onto the App

00:24:06.186 --> 00:24:07.646 A:middle
Store to get rid of those one

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:08.786 A:middle
star reviews from all that

00:24:08.786 --> 00:24:09.416 A:middle
crashing.

00:24:10.186 --> 00:24:11.426 A:middle
But while Kieran was up here I

00:24:11.426 --> 00:24:13.136 A:middle
had another really cool idea

00:24:13.136 --> 00:24:14.506 A:middle
that I was just thinking about.

00:24:14.506 --> 00:24:15.456 A:middle
So I'm going to create a new

00:24:15.456 --> 00:24:15.946 A:middle
project.

00:24:16.586 --> 00:24:20.936 A:middle
So let's open up Xcode and let's

00:24:20.936 --> 00:24:22.696 A:middle
get started with a new Xcode

00:24:22.696 --> 00:24:23.076 A:middle
project.

00:24:23.076 --> 00:24:24.626 A:middle
And you know what I was thinking

00:24:24.626 --> 00:24:25.716 A:middle
would be really fun is if we

00:24:25.716 --> 00:24:28.116 A:middle
made some SCM centric stickers

00:24:28.226 --> 00:24:28.436 A:middle
for iOS.

00:24:28.436 --> 00:24:30.536 A:middle
So I'm going to make a sticker

00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:31.036 A:middle
pack app.

00:24:31.496 --> 00:24:32.976 A:middle
So I'll just select that and

00:24:32.976 --> 00:24:35.576 A:middle
call it "SCM Stickers."

00:24:37.406 --> 00:24:38.696 A:middle
Now every time you create a new

00:24:38.696 --> 00:24:40.516 A:middle
project in Xcode, Xcode always

00:24:40.516 --> 00:24:41.806 A:middle
offers you the option to create

00:24:41.806 --> 00:24:43.476 A:middle
a git repository right then and

00:24:43.476 --> 00:24:45.576 A:middle
there as you create the project.

00:24:46.046 --> 00:24:47.366 A:middle
Now personally I always do this,

00:24:47.366 --> 00:24:48.306 A:middle
even if I think it's just a

00:24:48.306 --> 00:24:49.646 A:middle
throwaway project or I'm testing

00:24:49.646 --> 00:24:50.986 A:middle
some code because you never know

00:24:50.986 --> 00:24:52.446 A:middle
how long you're going to keep

00:24:52.446 --> 00:24:54.236 A:middle
working on the same thing and

00:24:54.236 --> 00:24:55.406 A:middle
this way you always have history

00:24:55.406 --> 00:24:57.006 A:middle
from the very beginning of time

00:24:57.006 --> 00:24:57.776 A:middle
for your project.

00:24:59.096 --> 00:25:00.196 A:middle
So let's create that git

00:24:59.096 --> 00:25:00.196 A:middle
So let's create that git

00:25:00.196 --> 00:25:01.466 A:middle
repository on my Mac.

00:25:02.946 --> 00:25:04.176 A:middle
And now I have my sticker app.

00:25:05.306 --> 00:25:06.166 A:middle
If we go to the source control

00:25:06.166 --> 00:25:08.316 A:middle
navigator from this app we see

00:25:08.316 --> 00:25:09.696 A:middle
that I have a working copy that

00:25:09.696 --> 00:25:11.216 A:middle
was automatically created by

00:25:11.216 --> 00:25:13.056 A:middle
Xcode and it has one branch

00:25:13.196 --> 00:25:14.326 A:middle
master which is current.

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:16.876 A:middle
And it has the initial commit,

00:25:16.876 --> 00:25:18.006 A:middle
which is essentially just all

00:25:18.006 --> 00:25:21.426 A:middle
the template stuff from Xcode.

00:25:22.226 --> 00:25:23.146 A:middle
So now it's time to put my

00:25:23.146 --> 00:25:24.686 A:middle
stickers into my app.

00:25:25.656 --> 00:25:26.856 A:middle
So let's go over to the project

00:25:26.856 --> 00:25:28.476 A:middle
navigator and select the

00:25:28.476 --> 00:25:29.266 A:middle
"stickers" folder.

00:25:31.106 --> 00:25:32.336 A:middle
And I already have a few

00:25:32.336 --> 00:25:33.396 A:middle
stickers here that I like.

00:25:33.606 --> 00:25:36.356 A:middle
I've got one of a "tag" icon and

00:25:36.356 --> 00:25:38.366 A:middle
I've got a few emoji peeking out

00:25:38.366 --> 00:25:39.036 A:middle
from a safe.

00:25:39.216 --> 00:25:42.256 A:middle
That says "SCM."

00:25:42.496 --> 00:25:46.186 A:middle
So let's put those all into my

00:25:46.186 --> 00:25:49.246 A:middle
sticker pack and go to "commit."

00:25:49.246 --> 00:25:51.466 A:middle
So I'll go ahead and commit all

00:25:51.466 --> 00:25:51.976 A:middle
those stickers.

00:25:57.046 --> 00:25:58.726 A:middle
And now they're all part of my

00:25:58.916 --> 00:25:59.346 A:middle
history.

00:26:00.516 --> 00:26:02.006 A:middle
And if I look at my branch I

00:26:02.006 --> 00:26:02.786 A:middle
have two commits.

00:26:04.256 --> 00:26:05.106 A:middle
But if I open the "remotes"

00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:06.956 A:middle
folder I don't have a remote.

00:26:07.366 --> 00:26:08.966 A:middle
In fact this project only exists

00:26:08.966 --> 00:26:09.446 A:middle
locally.

00:26:09.516 --> 00:26:11.166 A:middle
So while git is tracking history

00:26:11.166 --> 00:26:12.726 A:middle
for my project, if I want to

00:26:12.726 --> 00:26:14.256 A:middle
check it out on another machine,

00:26:14.526 --> 00:26:17.206 A:middle
share it with somebody else, or

00:26:17.206 --> 00:26:19.366 A:middle
if I lose this machine, this is

00:26:19.366 --> 00:26:20.036 A:middle
the only copy.

00:26:20.186 --> 00:26:21.526 A:middle
So I need to make sure that I

00:26:21.526 --> 00:26:23.086 A:middle
can put it somewhere where it's

00:26:23.086 --> 00:26:24.456 A:middle
safe and easy to share with

00:26:24.456 --> 00:26:25.036 A:middle
other people.

00:26:25.516 --> 00:26:26.376 A:middle
And for that I'm going to use

00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:26.926 A:middle
GitHub again.

00:26:27.816 --> 00:26:28.966 A:middle
So if I control click on the

00:26:28.966 --> 00:26:31.076 A:middle
"remotes" folder I see that one

00:26:31.146 --> 00:26:32.626 A:middle
of the options is that I can now

00:26:32.626 --> 00:26:34.816 A:middle
create the SCM stickers remote

00:26:35.076 --> 00:26:35.796 A:middle
right on GitHub.

00:26:36.166 --> 00:26:39.066 A:middle
And if I select that a new sheet

00:26:39.066 --> 00:26:40.626 A:middle
comes down and asks me all the

00:26:40.626 --> 00:26:42.296 A:middle
things I want to set up about my

00:26:42.296 --> 00:26:43.156 A:middle
project on GitHub.

00:26:43.766 --> 00:26:44.886 A:middle
I get to choose what account

00:26:45.216 --> 00:26:45.866 A:middle
that I'm going to use.

00:26:45.866 --> 00:26:46.556 A:middle
So I'll use mine.

00:26:47.096 --> 00:26:48.186 A:middle
And I can select the owner.

00:26:48.186 --> 00:26:49.786 A:middle
So if you're a member of

00:26:49.786 --> 00:26:51.036 A:middle
organizations and have

00:26:51.036 --> 00:26:51.716 A:middle
permission to create

00:26:51.716 --> 00:26:53.636 A:middle
repositories for them you can

00:26:53.636 --> 00:26:55.876 A:middle
actually create repositories for

00:26:55.876 --> 00:26:56.816 A:middle
your organizations.

00:26:57.776 --> 00:26:59.446 A:middle
And then I get to select a name

00:26:59.446 --> 00:27:00.656 A:middle
for my project and by default

00:26:59.446 --> 00:27:00.656 A:middle
for my project and by default

00:27:00.656 --> 00:27:01.916 A:middle
it'll just pick the project

00:27:01.916 --> 00:27:03.346 A:middle
name; "SCM Stickers."

00:27:03.896 --> 00:27:05.706 A:middle
If we look closely we see that

00:27:05.786 --> 00:27:07.326 A:middle
the owner name and repository

00:27:07.326 --> 00:27:09.486 A:middle
name combine to form the URL

00:27:09.486 --> 00:27:10.406 A:middle
where you'll be able to check

00:27:10.406 --> 00:27:11.636 A:middle
this out on the World Wide Web.

00:27:12.466 --> 00:27:13.366 A:middle
Now let's give it a little bit

00:27:13.366 --> 00:27:13.976 A:middle
of a description.

00:27:17.556 --> 00:27:19.336 A:middle
And while I would say check it

00:27:19.336 --> 00:27:20.566 A:middle
out on the World Wide Web, but I

00:27:20.566 --> 00:27:22.056 A:middle
can actually make it private so

00:27:22.056 --> 00:27:23.336 A:middle
that no one but me can see it

00:27:23.336 --> 00:27:24.966 A:middle
and commit to it because I don't

00:27:24.966 --> 00:27:25.926 A:middle
think the world's quite ready

00:27:25.926 --> 00:27:26.466 A:middle
for these yet.

00:27:27.156 --> 00:27:28.456 A:middle
If I go ahead and select

00:27:28.456 --> 00:27:30.226 A:middle
"create" that project will get

00:27:30.226 --> 00:27:31.416 A:middle
created on GitHub under my

00:27:31.416 --> 00:27:33.526 A:middle
account and all my changes will

00:27:33.526 --> 00:27:34.616 A:middle
get pushed right up to the

00:27:34.616 --> 00:27:35.006 A:middle
server.

00:27:36.056 --> 00:27:37.636 A:middle
Ah, I forgot one of the stickers

00:27:37.636 --> 00:27:38.696 A:middle
and it's my favorite one!

00:27:39.126 --> 00:27:40.166 A:middle
Let's go back to the project

00:27:40.166 --> 00:27:42.786 A:middle
navigator and select "stickers."

00:27:43.676 --> 00:27:44.636 A:middle
And I don't know if you know

00:27:44.636 --> 00:27:45.996 A:middle
this, but GitHub's logo is

00:27:45.996 --> 00:27:47.206 A:middle
actually an octo-cat.

00:27:47.586 --> 00:27:49.496 A:middle
Well, I thought I'd take my --

00:27:49.566 --> 00:27:51.066 A:middle
try my hand at making my own

00:27:51.106 --> 00:27:51.796 A:middle
octo-cat.

00:27:52.296 --> 00:27:53.416 A:middle
And so let's add that as one of

00:27:53.416 --> 00:27:54.086 A:middle
the stickers.

00:27:55.286 --> 00:27:57.806 A:middle
And let's go ahead and go commit

00:27:57.806 --> 00:27:58.276 A:middle
that.

00:27:58.886 --> 00:27:59.906 A:middle
Make sure that that gets up on

00:27:59.906 --> 00:28:00.916 A:middle
the GitHub too.

00:27:59.906 --> 00:28:00.916 A:middle
the GitHub too.

00:28:02.306 --> 00:28:05.146 A:middle
Octo-cat. Now, since I now have

00:28:05.146 --> 00:28:07.156 A:middle
a remote I can go ahead and push

00:28:07.156 --> 00:28:08.426 A:middle
all my changes right up to

00:28:08.426 --> 00:28:09.376 A:middle
GitHub where they're safe and

00:28:09.376 --> 00:28:11.356 A:middle
secure as I commit to skip a

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:13.256 A:middle
whole bunch of extra steps of

00:28:13.256 --> 00:28:14.096 A:middle
having to do it later.

00:28:14.096 --> 00:28:15.036 A:middle
And this way I don't end up

00:28:15.036 --> 00:28:17.816 A:middle
behind from my remote branch.

00:28:18.476 --> 00:28:19.516 A:middle
So I'll just go ahead and commit

00:28:19.516 --> 00:28:22.576 A:middle
and push those files and that

00:28:22.726 --> 00:28:24.466 A:middle
sticker now will also be up on

00:28:24.466 --> 00:28:24.806 A:middle
GitHub.

00:28:26.586 --> 00:28:28.376 A:middle
If I go to my repository -- or

00:28:28.376 --> 00:28:29.046 A:middle
sorry -- my source control

00:28:29.046 --> 00:28:30.256 A:middle
navigator again and look at my

00:28:30.256 --> 00:28:32.336 A:middle
master branch it now has three

00:28:32.336 --> 00:28:33.366 A:middle
commits and I see that the

00:28:33.366 --> 00:28:35.566 A:middle
remote's origin master branch is

00:28:35.566 --> 00:28:36.816 A:middle
also at the same place.

00:28:37.616 --> 00:28:38.946 A:middle
If I want to be even further

00:28:38.946 --> 00:28:40.346 A:middle
sure that this commit made it up

00:28:40.346 --> 00:28:41.756 A:middle
onto GitHub or I wanted to look

00:28:41.756 --> 00:28:43.446 A:middle
at it on GitHub I can just

00:28:43.446 --> 00:28:45.656 A:middle
control click the commit, and

00:28:45.656 --> 00:28:47.256 A:middle
like any other object in source

00:28:47.256 --> 00:28:48.426 A:middle
control and Xcode, such as a

00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:50.986 A:middle
branch or tag or remote, I can

00:28:50.986 --> 00:28:51.816 A:middle
view it on GitHub.

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:54.206 A:middle
And if I select that Safari will

00:28:54.206 --> 00:28:55.796 A:middle
open up straight to that commit

00:28:55.796 --> 00:28:57.506 A:middle
on GitHub and I see my beautiful

00:28:57.506 --> 00:28:57.976 A:middle
octo-cat.

00:28:58.516 --> 00:29:05.566 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:29:06.066 --> 00:29:06.786 A:middle
Now I want Kieran to be able to

00:29:06.786 --> 00:29:08.406 A:middle
check this out to, but I made it

00:29:08.436 --> 00:29:08.856 A:middle
private.

00:29:08.856 --> 00:29:10.726 A:middle
So let's go to "settings" and

00:29:10.726 --> 00:29:12.056 A:middle
add him as a collaborator.

00:29:13.176 --> 00:29:13.816 A:middle
And we've got to make sure we're

00:29:13.816 --> 00:29:14.356 A:middle
secure.

00:29:17.036 --> 00:29:19.006 A:middle
So let's add Kieran.

00:29:19.726 --> 00:29:20.296 A:middle
There he is.

00:29:20.836 --> 00:29:22.076 A:middle
So we'll add him as a

00:29:22.076 --> 00:29:23.256 A:middle
collaborator so now he can see

00:29:23.256 --> 00:29:24.516 A:middle
this private repo too.

00:29:24.516 --> 00:29:26.626 A:middle
And I want him to check it out

00:29:26.626 --> 00:29:27.826 A:middle
as soon as possible.

00:29:27.826 --> 00:29:29.976 A:middle
So I'm going to make it really

00:29:29.976 --> 00:29:31.686 A:middle
easy for him and I'm going to go

00:29:31.686 --> 00:29:33.616 A:middle
ahead and we see on GitHub the

00:29:33.616 --> 00:29:34.906 A:middle
"clone" -- or "download" button,

00:29:35.196 --> 00:29:36.576 A:middle
just like we showed earlier the

00:29:36.576 --> 00:29:37.796 A:middle
"open in Xcode" button is right

00:29:37.796 --> 00:29:40.136 A:middle
there and I can even select that

00:29:40.186 --> 00:29:41.746 A:middle
and just share that link with

00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:42.936 A:middle
him in mail.

00:29:43.536 --> 00:29:44.386 A:middle
Let's see here.

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:46.636 A:middle
Let's send that to Kieran.

00:29:47.546 --> 00:29:51.436 A:middle
"Check out my stickers."

00:29:52.216 --> 00:29:53.266 A:middle
We'll send that to Kieran so he

00:29:53.266 --> 00:29:54.576 A:middle
can just click this link right

00:29:54.576 --> 00:29:55.436 A:middle
on his machine as soon as he

00:29:55.436 --> 00:29:57.286 A:middle
gets it, Xcode will open, clone

00:29:57.286 --> 00:29:58.406 A:middle
it, and he can have fun with my

00:29:58.406 --> 00:29:59.000 A:middle
octo-cat.

00:30:00.366 --> 00:30:03.506 A:middle
Great. So now before he does

00:30:03.506 --> 00:30:04.336 A:middle
check that out I want to bring

00:30:04.336 --> 00:30:05.736 A:middle
him back on stage to talk a

00:30:05.736 --> 00:30:06.926 A:middle
little bit more about source

00:30:06.926 --> 00:30:07.646 A:middle
control and Xcode.

00:30:07.646 --> 00:30:07.906 A:middle
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:30:14.386 --> 00:30:14.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:15.796 A:middle
Thank you, Eric.

00:30:15.796 --> 00:30:17.026 A:middle
I'll be sure to check that out

00:30:17.026 --> 00:30:18.396 A:middle
on the World Wide Web later.

00:30:19.216 --> 00:30:20.096 A:middle
It's okay; I lived through the

00:30:20.096 --> 00:30:20.666 A:middle
'90s.

00:30:22.236 --> 00:30:24.486 A:middle
So Eric showed us how easy it is

00:30:24.486 --> 00:30:26.136 A:middle
to get started with source

00:30:26.136 --> 00:30:27.466 A:middle
control and Xcode.

00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:29.496 A:middle
By adding your GitHub account

00:30:29.836 --> 00:30:31.906 A:middle
you have quick access to all of

00:30:31.906 --> 00:30:32.816 A:middle
your repositories.

00:30:33.526 --> 00:30:34.586 A:middle
With the new source control

00:30:34.586 --> 00:30:37.066 A:middle
navigator we saw how easy it is

00:30:37.386 --> 00:30:39.066 A:middle
to manage your branches, tags,

00:30:39.066 --> 00:30:39.826 A:middle
and remotes.

00:30:40.336 --> 00:30:42.686 A:middle
And finally, we saw how easy it

00:30:42.686 --> 00:30:44.536 A:middle
is to create a new project on

00:30:44.536 --> 00:30:46.286 A:middle
GitHub and push all your code

00:30:46.286 --> 00:30:46.546 A:middle
up.

00:30:47.226 --> 00:30:49.096 A:middle
So for more information check

00:30:49.096 --> 00:30:50.956 A:middle
out session 405 on

00:30:50.956 --> 00:30:52.616 A:middle
developer.apple.com.

00:30:53.096 --> 00:30:54.286 A:middle
There are also some related

00:30:54.286 --> 00:30:55.666 A:middle
sessions you can take a look at.

00:30:56.126 --> 00:30:56.856 A:middle
You're very welcome.

00:30:57.886 --> 00:30:58.826 A:middle
Have a good rest of the week.

00:30:58.826 --> 00:30:58.976 A:middle
Thanks!
