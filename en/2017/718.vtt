00:00:07.516 --> 00:00:17.146 A:middle
[ Background Conversations ]

00:00:17.646 --> 00:00:18.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Welcome.

00:00:19.106 --> 00:00:20.796 A:middle
This year, we are delighted to

00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:22.896 A:middle
introduce a new framework in iOS

00:00:22.896 --> 00:00:25.756 A:middle
11 called Core NFC, that would

00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:27.946 A:middle
allow your apps to integrate NFC

00:00:27.946 --> 00:00:30.466 A:middle
on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:34.126 A:middle
Using Core NFC, apps can

00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:35.486 A:middle
interact with their physical

00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:37.076 A:middle
environment and the real-world

00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:38.046 A:middle
objects within it.

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:41.056 A:middle
You may already know that Apple

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.736 A:middle
Pay uses NFC for complex

00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:44.376 A:middle
payment.

00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:46.966 A:middle
Now, with the introduction of

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:49.656 A:middle
Core NFC, you will be able to

00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:52.716 A:middle
use NFC in your applications to

00:00:52.716 --> 00:00:54.576 A:middle
create new and innovative user

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:58.676 A:middle
experiences with the iPhone.

00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:00.686 A:middle
In this session, we will give

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:02.436 A:middle
you a brief overview of new

00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:04.476 A:middle
field communications, what is

00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:06.576 A:middle
supported in the Core NFC

00:01:06.576 --> 00:01:08.916 A:middle
framework, the requirements and

00:01:08.916 --> 00:01:11.236 A:middle
details for using it, and some

00:01:11.236 --> 00:01:12.096 A:middle
example code.

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:16.056 A:middle
To start off, let's talk a

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:17.616 A:middle
little bit about Near Field

00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:18.346 A:middle
Communication.

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:22.736 A:middle
Near Field Communication, known

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:25.686 A:middle
simply as NFC, is a wireless

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.126 A:middle
technology that allows the

00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:28.926 A:middle
exchange of information between

00:01:28.926 --> 00:01:30.576 A:middle
devices that are within close

00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:31.276 A:middle
proximity.

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:33.986 A:middle
Limited to a range of just a few

00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:34.796 A:middle
centimeters.

00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:38.366 A:middle
NFC is actually a collection of

00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:39.936 A:middle
a number of different standards

00:01:39.936 --> 00:01:40.846 A:middle
and protocols.

00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:43.696 A:middle
All of these standards coexist

00:01:43.696 --> 00:01:45.066 A:middle
and are used in different

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:45.896 A:middle
applications.

00:01:46.896 --> 00:01:48.316 A:middle
You may have seen or had

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:50.156 A:middle
experience with NFC text.

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:51.926 A:middle
The small little stickers or

00:01:51.926 --> 00:01:53.706 A:middle
cards which can be read

00:01:54.086 --> 00:01:56.066 A:middle
wirelessly by an NFC reader.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.396 A:middle
NFC text comes in a wide variety

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:01.326 A:middle
of shapes, sizes, and

00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:02.056 A:middle
capacities.

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:04.496 A:middle
They are classified into five

00:02:04.536 --> 00:02:06.286 A:middle
categories, known as Type 1

00:02:06.536 --> 00:02:07.306 A:middle
through Type 5.

00:02:08.176 --> 00:02:09.636 A:middle
Each one corresponding to a

00:02:09.636 --> 00:02:10.466 A:middle
different standard.

00:02:11.376 --> 00:02:13.896 A:middle
For example, Type 3 texts are

00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:14.956 A:middle
based on FEDECA [assumed

00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:17.256 A:middle
spelling] and Type 4 is based on

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:21.486 A:middle
ISO-14443.

00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:23.856 A:middle
The NFC Forum has defined the

00:02:23.856 --> 00:02:26.576 A:middle
NFC Data Exchange Format, or

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:28.726 A:middle
NDEF for short, as a common

00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:30.526 A:middle
messaging format for exchanging

00:02:30.526 --> 00:02:32.646 A:middle
data in a standardized way among

00:02:32.646 --> 00:02:34.356 A:middle
the different text types.

00:02:36.586 --> 00:02:38.036 A:middle
Now that we have covered some

00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:40.586 A:middle
NFC basics, let's take a look at

00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:43.086 A:middle
what you can do with Core NFC.

00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:47.016 A:middle
For the initial launch of Core

00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:49.626 A:middle
NFC, we have focused on NFC Tag

00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:51.146 A:middle
Reading, which can be used to

00:02:51.146 --> 00:02:52.886 A:middle
enhance the user experience in a

00:02:52.886 --> 00:02:54.516 A:middle
wide variety of ways.

00:02:55.686 --> 00:02:57.516 A:middle
Potential applications include

00:02:59.196 --> 00:03:01.606 A:middle
connecting user to location or

00:03:01.606 --> 00:03:03.586 A:middle
context-specific content,

00:03:04.686 --> 00:03:06.026 A:middle
connecting physical hardware

00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:09.086 A:middle
with your application, and even

00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:10.666 A:middle
for in-store product information

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:11.886 A:middle
or inventory tracking.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:15.306 A:middle
In addition, NFC Tags can be

00:03:15.306 --> 00:03:17.206 A:middle
used in place of QR codes.

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:21.876 A:middle
Core NFC will allow your

00:03:21.876 --> 00:03:23.686 A:middle
application to read any NDEF

00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:24.626 A:middle
formatted tag.

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:27.066 A:middle
This greatly simplifies the

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:28.586 A:middle
process of reading tags within

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:30.056 A:middle
your application or for having

00:03:30.056 --> 00:03:31.196 A:middle
to deal with the different

00:03:31.196 --> 00:03:31.936 A:middle
standards.

00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:34.366 A:middle
Tag reading is supported on

00:03:34.496 --> 00:03:36.416 A:middle
iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

00:03:37.586 --> 00:03:39.806 A:middle
At this time, Core NFC does not

00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:41.576 A:middle
support writing or formatting

00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:42.406 A:middle
operations.

00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:46.886 A:middle
There are two requirements for

00:03:46.886 --> 00:03:48.386 A:middle
using Core NFC in your

00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:49.616 A:middle
application.

00:03:51.896 --> 00:03:53.816 A:middle
First, Core NFC is an

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:54.966 A:middle
entitlement-protective

00:03:54.966 --> 00:03:55.486 A:middle
framework.

00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:58.216 A:middle
You will need to turn on the

00:03:58.216 --> 00:04:00.116 A:middle
Near Field Communication Tag

00:04:00.116 --> 00:04:02.406 A:middle
Reading Capability from Xcode to

00:04:02.406 --> 00:04:03.476 A:middle
get this entitlement.

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:05.856 A:middle
However, this capability would

00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:07.426 A:middle
not be in Xcode for the first

00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:09.216 A:middle
[inaudible] released at WWDC.

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:11.966 A:middle
In the meantime, you can

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:13.326 A:middle
manually request this

00:04:13.326 --> 00:04:14.756 A:middle
entitlement by visiting the

00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:17.016 A:middle
Certificates, Identifiers and

00:04:17.016 --> 00:04:19.186 A:middle
Profiles page on the Apple

00:04:19.186 --> 00:04:20.196 A:middle
Developer website.

00:04:23.916 --> 00:04:25.796 A:middle
The second requirement for Core

00:04:25.826 --> 00:04:28.056 A:middle
NFC is a Scan Usage Description.

00:04:29.346 --> 00:04:30.976 A:middle
This string is required in your

00:04:30.976 --> 00:04:33.016 A:middle
application's info P-list file,

00:04:33.346 --> 00:04:34.786 A:middle
and it will be displayed to the

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:36.126 A:middle
user when your application

00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:38.426 A:middle
starts NFC scanning.

00:04:39.386 --> 00:04:40.716 A:middle
For more information, you can

00:04:40.716 --> 00:04:43.986 A:middle
watch the WWDC session, Privacy

00:04:44.076 --> 00:04:44.956 A:middle
and Your Apps.

00:04:45.526 --> 00:04:49.656 A:middle
Now that you have configured

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:51.666 A:middle
your project correctly, let's

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.066 A:middle
review some additional details

00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:54.846 A:middle
about tag reading with the Core

00:04:54.846 --> 00:04:55.706 A:middle
NFC framework.

00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:00.856 A:middle
First, tag reading is an

00:05:00.856 --> 00:05:02.916 A:middle
on-demand process, meaning that

00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:04.656 A:middle
your application has to initiate

00:05:04.656 --> 00:05:06.496 A:middle
a tag reading activity using a

00:05:06.496 --> 00:05:06.986 A:middle
session.

00:05:09.016 --> 00:05:11.086 A:middle
Second, your application has to

00:05:11.086 --> 00:05:12.906 A:middle
be visible and foregrounded in

00:05:12.906 --> 00:05:14.436 A:middle
order to start a tag reading

00:05:14.436 --> 00:05:14.996 A:middle
activity.

00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:17.096 A:middle
A tag reading session will be

00:05:17.096 --> 00:05:18.596 A:middle
ended if your application is

00:05:18.596 --> 00:05:20.146 A:middle
backgrounded or ceases to be

00:05:20.146 --> 00:05:20.566 A:middle
visible.

00:05:22.466 --> 00:05:24.596 A:middle
Next, each tag reading activity

00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:26.326 A:middle
is limited to 60 seconds at a

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:26.746 A:middle
time.

00:05:26.986 --> 00:05:28.956 A:middle
If a session has timed out or

00:05:28.956 --> 00:05:30.586 A:middle
invalidated, your application

00:05:30.586 --> 00:05:31.936 A:middle
must create a new session to

00:05:31.936 --> 00:05:33.646 A:middle
initiate another tag reading

00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:34.206 A:middle
activity.

00:05:34.736 --> 00:05:38.246 A:middle
You can configure a session to

00:05:38.246 --> 00:05:40.096 A:middle
read either a single tag or

00:05:40.096 --> 00:05:41.126 A:middle
multiple tags.

00:05:41.616 --> 00:05:43.596 A:middle
In a single tag reading mode,

00:05:44.506 --> 00:05:45.516 A:middle
the session will be ended

00:05:45.516 --> 00:05:47.316 A:middle
automatically after a tag is

00:05:47.316 --> 00:05:47.676 A:middle
read.

00:05:48.276 --> 00:05:50.296 A:middle
On the other hand, a multi-tag

00:05:50.296 --> 00:05:51.636 A:middle
reading session will remain

00:05:51.636 --> 00:05:53.096 A:middle
active until canceled by the

00:05:53.096 --> 00:05:54.966 A:middle
user, or the 60-second timeout

00:05:54.966 --> 00:05:55.606 A:middle
is reached.

00:05:58.246 --> 00:06:00.156 A:middle
Finally, as mentioned

00:06:00.156 --> 00:06:02.996 A:middle
previously, the NFC Usage String

00:06:04.176 --> 00:06:06.136 A:middle
defined in your info P-list will

00:06:06.136 --> 00:06:07.706 A:middle
be displayed to the user while

00:06:07.706 --> 00:06:09.166 A:middle
the tag reading activity is in

00:06:09.166 --> 00:06:09.746 A:middle
progress.

00:06:10.296 --> 00:06:13.926 A:middle
We have provided a sample

00:06:13.926 --> 00:06:15.126 A:middle
application along with this

00:06:15.126 --> 00:06:16.436 A:middle
presentation to demonstrate the

00:06:16.436 --> 00:06:19.126 A:middle
use of Core NFC.

00:06:19.126 --> 00:06:20.396 A:middle
Consider the case where you want

00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:21.566 A:middle
to take a physical kind of

00:06:21.566 --> 00:06:22.266 A:middle
inventory.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.666 A:middle
Here, we are showing you the key

00:06:24.666 --> 00:06:26.446 A:middle
user interaction sequence of the

00:06:26.446 --> 00:06:27.466 A:middle
sample application.

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:29.936 A:middle
The sample application consists

00:06:29.936 --> 00:06:31.806 A:middle
of a main table view, and a Scan

00:06:31.806 --> 00:06:32.266 A:middle
button.

00:06:32.846 --> 00:06:34.686 A:middle
Every time an inventory item is

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:36.486 A:middle
scanned, it is displayed as a

00:06:36.486 --> 00:06:38.086 A:middle
role entry in this main table

00:06:38.086 --> 00:06:38.416 A:middle
view.

00:06:39.186 --> 00:06:40.906 A:middle
Just click on the Scan button to

00:06:40.906 --> 00:06:44.876 A:middle
start a tag scanning.

00:06:45.036 --> 00:06:46.816 A:middle
This UI will be presented to the

00:06:46.816 --> 00:06:48.836 A:middle
user hopefully on top of your

00:06:48.836 --> 00:06:50.836 A:middle
application once tag scanning

00:06:50.836 --> 00:06:51.476 A:middle
has begun.

00:06:52.636 --> 00:06:54.406 A:middle
During tag scanning, the user's

00:06:54.406 --> 00:06:56.076 A:middle
description string is displayed

00:06:56.076 --> 00:06:56.986 A:middle
within the UI.

00:06:57.986 --> 00:06:59.496 A:middle
At any time, the user can hit

00:06:59.496 --> 00:07:01.106 A:middle
the Cancel button to stop a tag

00:07:01.106 --> 00:07:03.146 A:middle
scanning, which will invalidate

00:07:03.146 --> 00:07:03.886 A:middle
the reader session.

00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:09.106 A:middle
The UI will get updated once an

00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:11.116 A:middle
NFC tag has been successfully

00:07:11.116 --> 00:07:11.476 A:middle
read.

00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:14.196 A:middle
Here, we have configured our

00:07:14.196 --> 00:07:15.916 A:middle
reader session to be single tag

00:07:15.916 --> 00:07:16.516 A:middle
read mode.

00:07:19.786 --> 00:07:22.026 A:middle
Finally, the overlaid UI will be

00:07:22.026 --> 00:07:23.526 A:middle
dismissed, and the application

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.136 A:middle
will be foregrounded once the

00:07:25.276 --> 00:07:26.886 A:middle
tag reading session has ended.

00:07:27.356 --> 00:07:30.966 A:middle
All right.

00:07:31.106 --> 00:07:32.136 A:middle
Let's walk through the code

00:07:32.136 --> 00:07:33.146 A:middle
together from the sample

00:07:33.146 --> 00:07:34.536 A:middle
application we have just shown.

00:07:35.136 --> 00:07:38.336 A:middle
At a high level, you would need

00:07:38.336 --> 00:07:39.766 A:middle
to perform these three easy

00:07:39.766 --> 00:07:41.916 A:middle
steps to enable tag reading in

00:07:41.916 --> 00:07:42.676 A:middle
your application.

00:07:43.636 --> 00:07:47.326 A:middle
First, adopt the NFC NDEF Reader

00:07:47.326 --> 00:07:48.836 A:middle
Session Delegate Protocol.

00:07:50.116 --> 00:07:52.596 A:middle
Next, create an instance of the

00:07:52.596 --> 00:07:54.626 A:middle
NFC NDEF Reader Session Class,

00:07:54.966 --> 00:07:56.546 A:middle
and provide it with your

00:07:56.546 --> 00:07:57.066 A:middle
delegate.

00:07:58.826 --> 00:08:01.086 A:middle
Finally, start a reader session

00:08:01.086 --> 00:08:02.506 A:middle
using the Begin method, and

00:08:02.506 --> 00:08:04.116 A:middle
handle the delegate callbacks.

00:08:04.686 --> 00:08:09.156 A:middle
Here is a cool snippet from the

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:10.676 A:middle
sample application, illustrating

00:08:10.676 --> 00:08:11.836 A:middle
the three-step approach.

00:08:13.046 --> 00:08:14.846 A:middle
To start off, we import the Core

00:08:14.846 --> 00:08:16.986 A:middle
NFC framework into the code.

00:08:20.456 --> 00:08:22.386 A:middle
Here we adopt the delegate

00:08:22.386 --> 00:08:23.706 A:middle
protocol in Table View

00:08:23.706 --> 00:08:25.016 A:middle
Controller, which will handle

00:08:25.016 --> 00:08:26.716 A:middle
the two required callbacks.

00:08:27.736 --> 00:08:30.996 A:middle
They invalidate with error and

00:08:31.516 --> 00:08:33.236 A:middle
detect NDEF.

00:08:33.836 --> 00:08:38.386 A:middle
The invalidate with error

00:08:38.386 --> 00:08:39.986 A:middle
callback will notify your

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:41.486 A:middle
application when a tag reading

00:08:41.486 --> 00:08:42.616 A:middle
activity has stopped.

00:08:43.306 --> 00:08:45.746 A:middle
This can happen for a variety of

00:08:45.786 --> 00:08:46.326 A:middle
reasons.

00:08:46.886 --> 00:08:48.556 A:middle
For example, a tag has been

00:08:48.556 --> 00:08:50.246 A:middle
successfully read in a single

00:08:50.246 --> 00:08:51.116 A:middle
tag read session.

00:08:52.056 --> 00:08:53.536 A:middle
The user has chosen to stop the

00:08:53.536 --> 00:08:54.696 A:middle
tag scanning activity.

00:08:54.996 --> 00:08:57.716 A:middle
The 3-second timeout has expired

00:08:58.646 --> 00:09:00.056 A:middle
or the application is no longer

00:09:00.056 --> 00:09:00.756 A:middle
in the foreground.

00:09:01.526 --> 00:09:03.766 A:middle
The specific session object

00:09:03.766 --> 00:09:05.186 A:middle
provided in the first parameter

00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:06.896 A:middle
will be invalidated after the

00:09:06.896 --> 00:09:07.926 A:middle
function exits.

00:09:08.296 --> 00:09:10.276 A:middle
A new reader session instance is

00:09:10.276 --> 00:09:12.146 A:middle
required for additional tag

00:09:12.146 --> 00:09:12.446 A:middle
reading.

00:09:14.396 --> 00:09:17.166 A:middle
The detect NDEFs will be invoked

00:09:17.286 --> 00:09:19.136 A:middle
every time an NDEF has been read

00:09:19.136 --> 00:09:20.226 A:middle
from an NFC tag.

00:09:21.426 --> 00:09:22.816 A:middle
Your application can then grab

00:09:22.816 --> 00:09:23.946 A:middle
the payload from the NDEF

00:09:23.946 --> 00:09:26.706 A:middle
message, decode it, and handle

00:09:26.706 --> 00:09:27.996 A:middle
the message as appropriate.

00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:33.846 A:middle
Finally, we have an extra method

00:09:33.846 --> 00:09:35.236 A:middle
that links to the Scan button

00:09:35.236 --> 00:09:36.736 A:middle
for starting a single tag read

00:09:36.736 --> 00:09:37.226 A:middle
session.

00:09:38.476 --> 00:09:40.196 A:middle
All you need to do is create an

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.136 A:middle
instance of NFC NDEF Reader

00:09:42.136 --> 00:09:43.786 A:middle
Session with your data gate,

00:09:44.316 --> 00:09:45.636 A:middle
then invoke to begin method to

00:09:45.636 --> 00:09:46.776 A:middle
start tag scanning.

00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:48.926 A:middle
If you wish to create a

00:09:48.926 --> 00:09:51.326 A:middle
multi-tag reading session, set

00:09:51.326 --> 00:09:53.126 A:middle
the invalidate at the first read

00:09:53.186 --> 00:09:54.316 A:middle
parameter to False.

00:09:54.736 --> 00:09:56.606 A:middle
If you need to stop an ongoing

00:09:56.606 --> 00:09:58.296 A:middle
session programmatically, you

00:09:58.296 --> 00:09:59.886 A:middle
can call the invalidate method.

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:02.116 A:middle
This will trigger your

00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:04.096 A:middle
invalidate with error callback,

00:10:04.576 --> 00:10:05.476 A:middle
letting you know that the

00:10:05.476 --> 00:10:06.396 A:middle
session has ended.

00:10:11.566 --> 00:10:13.386 A:middle
In summary, it is very simple to

00:10:13.386 --> 00:10:15.276 A:middle
enable NFC tag reading with Core

00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:17.766 A:middle
NFC by following these steps.

00:10:20.276 --> 00:10:22.116 A:middle
Enable the NFC tag reading

00:10:22.116 --> 00:10:22.846 A:middle
capability.

00:10:23.386 --> 00:10:26.676 A:middle
Make sure your Scan Usage

00:10:26.676 --> 00:10:28.336 A:middle
Description String is set in

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:30.426 A:middle
your info P-list.

00:10:32.116 --> 00:10:33.906 A:middle
Integrate the Core NFC framework

00:10:33.906 --> 00:10:34.566 A:middle
in your code.

00:10:35.146 --> 00:10:37.776 A:middle
And start reading tags.
