Good morning everyone. Welcome to the Accelerate framework session.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
My name is Luke Chang; I'm an engineer in Vector and Numerics Group.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I'm here today to talk about [the] Accelerate framework.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Have you ever thought about making an image processing app? Or audio equalizer app? Or any computation intensive app?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
If you have, you're in the right place.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Accelerate framework can help you make those apps, and more.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
That's why we would like to call it your "one-stop shopping" for fast and energy efficient libraries.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
We call it one-stop shopping for a reason. In the Accelerate framework, we support a wide range of computational functionalities.
