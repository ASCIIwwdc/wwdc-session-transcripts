00:00:10.547 --> 00:00:12.417
My name is Joshua Pennington

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:14.999
and I'm an engineer on the
Interface Builder Team

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.748
Today we're going to talk about

00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:19.289
how you can adopt Storyboards
in your app.

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:22.029
We're going to cover a couple topics today.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.942
We're going to start by giving
a quick overview of Storyboards.

00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:30.327
Then my colleague Tony is going to
come up here and talk about

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:34.418
how you can adopt Storyboards in
applications that use code or xibs

00:00:35.713 --> 00:00:39.359
And I'm going to finish by talking about
some great new features for Storyboards

00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:40.509
in iOS 6.

00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:43.234
Let's start with the basics.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
This is a Storyboard.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
This Storyboard allows to view you app's
entire user interface in one place.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And you can also view the transitions
between parts of your application

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
so you can very quickly get an overview
of the application just by glancing at it.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And there are two main concepts
in a Storyboard.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
The first concept if that of a "scene".

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
A scene is a view controller, and it can
represent an entire screen in your app

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
or just one major component area, like a
split view pane

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
and a split view controller on iPad.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And you can drag in views, you can select
things and resize them.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You can inspect your attributes
in the inspector.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
All of the normal interface builder
affordances are present here.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
This is where you're gonna spend
most of your time fleshing out the UI

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
of your application.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So that's the first concept:
the scene.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
The second concept if that
of a "segue".

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
A segue defines navigation in your
Storyboard.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
