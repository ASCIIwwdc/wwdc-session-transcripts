00:00:11.258 --> 00:00:14.121
Good Morning and Welcome to Session 714

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:18.043
For the next hour, myself and my
colleagues Conrad and Michael

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:20.955
are going to be talking about
protecting the user's data,

00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:24.400
and the part that you, the developers,
can play in that.

00:00:25.982 --> 00:00:27.790
First of all, a little bit about ourselves.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.937
We are all members of the
platform security team at Apple

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:33.534
and we really operate up
and down the stack,

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:35.581
all the way down from
the secure bootloader,

00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:38.596
all the way up to applications
and even the cloud.

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:41.333
But some times that we are always involved

00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:44.102
is when a cryptographic key is used

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:45.438
to protect user's data.

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:48.876
That's technologies you've probably
come across before.

00:00:51.254 --> 00:00:54.179
We also design and build solutions
for internal clients

00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:58.789
For example, we were involved with
designing the cryptography
used by iMessage.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:03.308
We expose a lot of that functionality,

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:04.466
through third partâ€”

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.085
APIs for use by third parties
such as yourselves;

00:01:07.312 --> 00:01:10.804
Security.framework, CommonCrypto
being examples.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
That functionality is also exposed

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
by other Apple APIs at an even higher level,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
for example, NSFileManager, CFNetwork,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
and we're going to be pulling

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
from both of those layers

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
during this presentation.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
What we're going to talk about:

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
We're going to look at a common situation,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
which is a client app talking to
a web service.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
We're going to subject it to
a hostile environment,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
a simulated attack, and show what can happen,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
talk about why that matters, and give some

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
simple steps that you can put
in your applications

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
to avoid falling foul of such attacks.
