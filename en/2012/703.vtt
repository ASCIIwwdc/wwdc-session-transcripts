99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Good morning.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
My name is Brian Tucker, and I am a manager in the iOS software engineering group.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Primarily I'm responsible pretty much for all Bluetooth technologies on iOS platforms.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So this is Core Bluetooth 101, this is not basket weaving.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
If you were looking for that, you're in the wrong room.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Core Bluetooth 101, primarily an API that focuses on Bluetooth Low Energy,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
which is a new technology that was ratified by the Bluetooth Standards bodies.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I believe at the end of 2010. It was introduced in our products last year with iOS 5 and the iPhone 4S.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And - why do we think it's important to talk about this technology?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Well, I think that low energy - in the sense of low energy, if you look at the technology perspective -

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
really applies to every single person in this room as a consumer,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
but especially as a technologist.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I'll give you an example:

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I was in China earlier this year, and had the opportunity to speak on this topic in China

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
in front of about 2000 people.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And in China of course you have translators.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I had never spoken to a group of people with translators before.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
They were sitting over there in this booth,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
and they had picked somebody in the front row to tell me when to slow down.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Because when you speak fast, the translators are like machines

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
this stuff is just flying out of their mouth.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So you have this guy in the front who was flashing this flashlight at me

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
- he'd flash the flashlight when I was talking too fast.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I'm watching my timer and I know how many slides I have left

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
and I realize there's no way I'm going to get through these slides.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So I look at him and he looks at me and we have this showdown

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
and he realizes I'm not going to slow down.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So at any moment I'm pretty sure he's going to throw the flashlight at me.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
But we get through it, get done on time

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
and all the slides got done

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
and I'm sure the translators are ready to shoot me.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So I walk down and I see the translators are running across the stage at me.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And I'm like here it is, I'm going to get killed.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Instead he comes up to me and says,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
"That was amazing!"

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And I'm like, "what?"

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And he's like, "I've never talked that fast in my life!"

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
He said, "I'm gonna go home today and start working on this technology!"
