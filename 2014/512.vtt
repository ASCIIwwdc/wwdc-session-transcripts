00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:11,894
      >> Hello, everyone.       

00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:13,562
        I'm Tim Hatcher.        

00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:14,797
         Good morning.          

00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:15,748
       Thanks for coming.       

00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,634
          [ Applause ]          

00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,054
    So I'm going to talk to     
    you about Web Inspector     

00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,358
     and Modern JavaScript.     

00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:29,779
  But first, I'm going to just  
 talk about Modern JavaScript.  

00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,999
      So, what exactly is       
       Modern JavaScript?       

00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,703
  Well, let's go through some   
  of the history of JavaScript  

00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,190
      which is also known       
         as ECMAScript          

00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,943
    as some of you may know.    

00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:45,795
  But it's had a long history.  

00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:47,830
It's been around since the '90s.

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,033
      And it had a lot of       
   momentum back in the '90s    

00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,920
     when it was first part     
      of the browser wars,      

00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,157
    but it kind of sputtered    
          and stalled.          

00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,060
    But JavaScript is alive     
       and well nowadays.       

00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,164
 Everyone is using it from web  
  apps to server applications,  

00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,486
and some of the standards bodies
  have been battling over some  

00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:15,825
 of what should be included in  
the next version of JavaScript. 

00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:21,497
 And I'm happy to say that they 
finally started coming together 

00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:28,137
   and started releasing what   
   is known as ECMAScript 6.    

00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:34,076
     And the sixth edition      
  brings a lot of cool things   

00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:37,813
and it's really just JavaScript 

00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:41,050
       and that's how I'm       
     going to refer to it.      

00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,321
In this modern JavaScript world,
 there's a lot of great things. 

00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:48,407
 And this is just some of them. 

00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:51,460
  There's some destructuring,   
        maps, promises.         

00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:54,763
     And let's go over some     
     of these new features      

00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:59,818
  that are also now available   
  in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.   

00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:06,525
  So when they're available, I  
mean, you can use them in Safari

00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,413
  or your iOS applications or   
 Mac applications and not just  

00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,784
    in web views but also a     
    JavaScriptCore context.     

00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,389
       So let's talk over       
         some of these.         

00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:24,393
     Let's first talk about     
      some math additions.      

00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,514
JavaScript has had a math object
   pretty much since day one.   

00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:34,503
But JavaScript nowadays is super
 fast, with the modern LLVM JIT 

00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,959
      that we have in iOS       
      8 and OS X Yosemite.      

00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,929
 You need these super fast math 
 functions to do complex things 

00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,784
     like WebGL or complex      
    scientific calculations.    

00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,889
 And most of you will recognize 
  a lot of things in this list  

00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,993
  that you've used in the past  
   for your own applications.   

00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:01,463
   And they're now available    
     in Modern JavaScript.      

00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,084
 So that's the math additions.  

00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,138
      Now let's talk about      
         maps and sets.         

00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,875
       So, what do I mean       
       by maps and sets?        

00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:17,229
    Well, in JavaScript, you    
 might think of this as a map.  

00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,900
   This is something that you   
   create as a generic object   

00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,053
      and it's really just      
        a property bag.         

00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,539
     You can throw whatever     
    you want on this object.    

00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:31,810
 You can set simple strings and 
  any object can be the value.  

00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,765
       And you can remove       
     things from that map.      

00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,219
     Well, these maps have      
       some limitations.        

00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,455
  There's string coercion when  
you're-when it comes to the key.

00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,942
Everything that is the key needs
  to be coerced into a string,  

00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:49,778
   so it's not going to give    
   you exactly what you want.   

00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:51,597
     If you want to use it      

00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,066
       for a property bag       
   that's tracking some node,   

00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,803
         it won't work.         

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,523
   Well in Modern JavaScript,   
   there's now a map object.    

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,493
       And it does pretty       
      much the same thing       

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,012
       that you would do        
        with an object.         

00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,165
      It has a little bit       
   different syntax and API,    

00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:12,818
      but it's pretty much      
         all the same.          

00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,853
       The most powerful        
        thing you can do        

00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,657
   with the map object is you   
 can use any value as the key.  

00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,445
    And a lot of people will    
  use this to track DOM nodes   

00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,332
  that they have in the page,   
  adding some additional data   

00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,537
 on the side instead of tacking 
  it onto the DOM node itself.  

00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,524
    So it really allows you     
    to compartmentalize data    

00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,077
      that you're tracking      
          on the page.          

00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:40,996
       But there are some       
       issues with that.        

00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,283
      If you add it to the      
     map, that map is going     

00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,468
 to hold a hard reference to it 

00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,188
     and that's why Modern      
   JavaScript has a WeakMap.    

00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,692
    And that means whenever     
       the key disappears       

00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,130
   or gets garbage collected,   
it's also removed from the map. 

00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,150
   So in this case, I have a    
  node in my WeakMap and when   

00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,872
 that node is removed by doing  
 a remove call or a removeChild 

00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,893
     in that page, it would     
    no longer be in the map     

00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:13,178
 and the data that's associated 

00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,163
     with it will also get      
       garbage collected.       

00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,467
    So that's maps and sets.    

00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,204
     And there's also a set     
   object that I didn't cover   

00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:24,539
but it's pretty straightforward.

00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:28,076
     It only allows the key     
    to be added to the set.     

00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,347
       So now let's talk        
      about Destructuring.      

00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,352
 If you got excited about some  
 of the new features in Swift,  

00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,857
   this will be right up your   
alley as far as JavaScript goes.

00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,762
  It allows you to return like  
 multiple objects in an array.  

00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,333
    In this case, I have an     
   array of two numbers here.   

00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:54,770
      And traditionally, I      
     would have to collect      

00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,022
    that in a result object.    

00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,642
   And I would have to break    
 each piece off from that array 

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,780
    to use it in a separate     
 variable that made more sense  

00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,066
in the scope I was using it in. 

00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,104
 But with destructuring, we can 
 break that down into one line. 

00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,825
     Now my function that's     
     returning two results      

00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,028
       that maybe didn't        
      make sense as array,      

00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,298
 but it was what I could use to 
return multiple things at once, 

00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,286
      I can now save those      
         into the alpha         

00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,340
       and beta variables       
    right there in one line.    

00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,978
  And this might look like an   
array but when it's on-when it's

00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:41,200
on the left side, we're dealing 
 with the destructuring syntax. 

00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,621
 And it's not just for arrays.  

00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,141
  You can destructure objects.  

00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,894
  And this is when it becomes   
  more of a pattern matching.   

00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,747
     So in my example here,     
   say I have a point object.   

00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,835
   And normally, I would have   
  to save it off into a result  

00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:02,654
      and break each piece      
        out if I wanted         

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,008
    to use some more concise    
  syntax for those variables.   

00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:11,664
     But now, I have object     
  destructuring in this case.   

00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:17,036
  And if I'd want a different   
variable name than the property,

00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,056
 I can separate them by colons, 
so x is the value that's coming 

00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,309
       out of the object        
        pattern matching        

00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,963
 and my x is the variable name  
in the local scope in this case.

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,633
        But if I want to        
       use the same name,       

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,586
    I could omit the second     
     piece and just use y.      

00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,856
      And y is now a local      
    variable in this scope.     

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,894
      And you can do some       
      really fancy things       

00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:44,913
   that I don't examples for.   

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,349
 But you can deeply nest these  
  pattern matches and objects   

00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:49,968
  with arrays and vice versa.   

00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:51,970
       So you can really        
    break apart your object     

00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,840
     if that-if that's what     
  works for your application.   

00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:58,727
    So that's destructuring.    

00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,347
   Now let's talk about what    
  we call the Spread Operator.  

00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,369
 And this is something that is  
 borrowed from many languages,  

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,574
   but it comes in very, very   
   handy and I love using it.   

00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,779
   It's-It really takes away    
   some of the common idioms    

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,367
  that you would do before if   
  you're building up arguments  

00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,405
    that you want to call in    
    a function as an array,     

00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,375
    before you would have to    
   resort to .call or .apply    

00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,412
  and pass in those arguments.  

00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,799
    But now, with the Spread    
 Operator which is represented  

00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,570
    by three dots prefixing     
           an object.           

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,123
        And in this case        
      it's-it's an array.       

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,493
    But secretly, the Spread    
  Operator works on anything.   

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,229
     It even works on maps.     

00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,583
    And it will break it out    
    in key value sequences.     

00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,887
So, anything that's has support 
 for iteration, which I'll talk 

00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:01,507
 about in a bit, can be spread. 

00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,143
  And this will spread it out   
    and call my function foo    

00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,230
    with the three arguments    
     that are in the array.     

00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,917
    One thing that you could    
     never do in JavaScript     

00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,137
  and you can only do now with  
the Spread Operator is called a 

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,841
   constructor with an array    
     input or a map input.      

00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,830
  You can now take your parts   
   of a date and spread them    

00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,433
  across the date constructor   
       instead of having        

00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,105
   to manually do 0, 1, 2 and   
    break it out like that.     

00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,445
      The Spread Operator       
         is also useful         

00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,465
      in the construction       
       of array literals.       

00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,435
     Say you have something     
   that's pretty repetitious.   

00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,504
  You want to have a separate   
   form and a combined form.    

00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,091
  Normally you have to either   
repeat the data or push and pop 

00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,362
      and add everything,       
concatenate everything together.

00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,900
  But with the Spread Operator  
you can just spread those other 

00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,888
 arrays right out into the new  
array that you're constructing. 

00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,309
  So this is a handy way to do  
 pretty complex concatenation.  

00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,146
     And you can understand     
        what it's doing         

00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,099
       without having the       
     parse different calls      

00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:19,918
 to different array functions.  

00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:22,704
 So that's the Spread Operator. 

00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:25,907
      Now let's talk about      
         something new.         

00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,761
     A new For loop that's      
    available in JavaScript.    

00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,899
   JavaScript has traditional   
  loops, which you can iterate  

00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,419
     over an array by doing     
     an index and a length.     

00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,089
    And you still might need    
    to use this if you care     

00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:43,892
 about the index or the length. 

00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,162
 And you're doing some complex  
   operation based on those.    

00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,919
 Some people have avoided this  
   syntax because it's ugly.    

00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,559
     And they use something     
 for-called forEach on an array 

00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,296
     that lets you iterate      
     over individual items      

00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,432
      and you handily get       
      the item right there      

00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:09,918
    that you can work with.     

00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:11,653
  But this creates a closure.   

00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,623
    It does a lot of complex    
 things that you might not want 

00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:17,909
  to deal with overhead-wise.   

00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,798
  Well, with the new For loop   
  that's in modern JavaScript,  

00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,202
 this is all you have to write  
   to iterate over an array.    

00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,523
   And this will iterate over   
    every item in the array     

00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:34,643
      if you break early,       
         it will stop.          

00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:36,711
But it starts at the first item.

00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,547
 But it's not just for arrays.  

00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,784
    Say you have a set, you     
   can iterate over that set.   

00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,988
 And if you have a map you can  
iterate over the key and value. 

00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,193
      Very similar to what      
      you can do in Swift.      

00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,863
So now you have the key in value
  right there to process both   

00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,166
    at the same time instead    
      of doing extra lines      

00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,735
 of code using the for-in loop  

00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:02,737
       which is available       
         on JavaScript.         

00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,106
       Now you can do it        
    right here with for-of.     

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,360
       And for-of is the        
      only way to iterate       

00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,446
over the keys in values in maps.

00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,216
       For-in will not do       
        what you expect         

00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,536
    and that-for reasons I'm    
     not going to go into.      

00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,356
     But maybe you want to      
    iterate over a WeakMap.     

00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,126
     That's not supported.      

00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,496
    For reasons that involve    
    the garbage collection,     

00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,466
  you cannot iterate over the   
 keys and values of the WeakMap 

00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:37,689
 and this is part of the spec.  
    So, that's for-of loops.    

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,080
      Now, one of the new       
  things in modern JavaScript   

00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,733
    that I'm really excited     
       about is Promises.       

00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,570
  And it solves a longstanding  
     problem of JavaScript.     

00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,256
      Now that JavaScript       
         is moving more         

00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,059
and more asynchronous everything
is asynchronous, you don't want 

00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,346
to be blocking your application.

00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:05,483
And say you have a function that
you've written that loads a URL,

00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,255
  maybe it does an XHR behind   
   the scenes for you to wrap   

00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,525
      up all the different      
   browser incompatibilities    

00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:15,510
      that are out there.       

00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,480
    So this will load a URL     
    and that's all it'll do.    

00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,666
    You can't get the data.     

00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,436
 To get the data, you might be  
 inclined to do a return result 

00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,822
       that gives you the       
     data that was loaded.      

00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,191
    But this is synchronous.    

00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,844
    You can't get away with     
   this in a shipping product   

00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,832
        without blocking        
      your user interface.      

00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,569
     So, you have to resort     
    to a callback function.     

00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:43,755
      And JavaScript makes      
        this real easy.         

00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:46,675
       I do this everyday       
         in JavaScript:         

00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:48,860
  pass in a callback function.  

00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:52,664
   And it works and it's very   
  usable and it's very handy.   

00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:57,969
    But when it gets deeply     
   nested and you're passing    

00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:01,422
    in multiple information     

00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,008
   and it just gets confusing   
      and hard to follow.       

00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,078
    You have all these load     
      calls in this case.       

00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,081
     Which one is handling      
       which information?       

00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,501
       Well, this is what       
        Promises solved.        

00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,288
     With Promises you can      
   write something like this    

00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,326
      where the first load      
       returns a promise.       

00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,529
       And immediately on       
    returning that promise,     

00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,481
 I can call the .then function. 

00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:28,400
     And that's pretty much     
     the only API you need      

00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,785
     to be concerned about      
         with Promises.         

00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,872
    And you can pass a call     
  back to that .then function   

00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,959
   which will get called when   
   that promise is fulfilled.   

00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,315
     And that callback can      
    return another promise.     

00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,169
  And this where it's magical,  

00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,855
       you can chain-keep       
      chaining along that.      

00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,092
 So these callbacks are in line 
 here just for clarity for you. 

00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,013
       But they might be        
        named functions         

00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,398
 that you have somewhere else.  

00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,285
And it makes it very clear that 
this is the order of operations.

00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:09,758
      So that's Promises.       

00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,929
And taking it to the next level 
 you can then use another API,  

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,817
   a global API, Promise.all.   

00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,655
 And what this does is you can  
 pass in an array of promises.  

00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,710
    And it will return a new    
  promise and that new promise  

00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:34,115
that it returns is dependent on 
all of those promises finishing.

00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,453
   If any of them error out,    

00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,039
     your "then" object can     
     get past the callback      

00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:43,408
  that gets called for errors.  

00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,244
    But in this case, "done"    
 will get called when only all  

00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,598
       of those promises        
     succeed or fulfilled.      

00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,620
    But maybe you only care     
      about the first one.      

00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:57,405
You're loading a bunch of images

00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,374
      and once you got one      
   image you're ready to go.    

00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:01,743
   That's where Promise.race    
           comes in.            

00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,330
       It will call your        
  callback when the first one   

00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:08,950
of those promises is fulfilled. 

00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,003
       So that's a quick        
      glance of Promises.       

00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,525
  So that pretty much wraps it  
   up with Modern JavaScript,   

00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,428
    at least the parts that     
   we've already implemented    

00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,081
        and decided were        
     ready for consumption.     

00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,116
There's a lot that's being done 

00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,502
      in ECMAScript 6 that      
         is not ready.          

00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,371
      And it's going to be      
   coming down the pipeline.    

00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:32,841
    But these pieces we feel    
    that you're ready to use    

00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:37,829
    in your application, in     
  browsers that support them.   

00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,118
    So now let's talk about     
       the Web Inspector.       

00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,889
   So if you're not familiar    
    with the Web Inspector,     

00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,276
  this is what it looks like.   

00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,529
  And we've had this UI for a   
  while but we've done a lot.   

00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:57,132
   We've fixed a lot of bugs.   

00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,350
 We've added a lot of features. 

00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,453
 But the main thing we've done  
   this year is make the Web    

00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,623
      Inspector available       
        in more places.         

00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,643
     We've listened to your     
feedback and you want to be able

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,146
to inspect your Mac application.

00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:13,798
 You want to be able to inspect 
  your JavaScriptCore context.  

00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,653
And that's exactly what you can 
do with iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.

00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,443
  So with Safari, you've been   
 able to inspect your iOS apps  

00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,349
  and iOS Safari by tethering   
      up to your computer.      

00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:38,222
  But now you can inspect your  
Mac application and right there 

00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,096
     from Safari see a list     
   of your Mac applications.    

00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,582
   So what's that look like?    

00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,101
But first, like I said, you want

00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:52,804
 to inspect your JavaScriptCore 
            context.            

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,090
      But Web Inspector is      
       all about the web.       

00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,978
And it's only been able to work 
with WebKit up until this point.

00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,231
     But now Web Inspector      
          can connect           

00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,783
  to your JavaScriptCore-based  
         applications.          

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,453
       So even if you're        
      not using a web view      

00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,639
but you're using JavaScriptCore 
  for some logic in your game,  

00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,093
       you can now debug        
     that JavaScript right      

00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,129
      in the Web Inspector      
     and it's really great.     

00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,182
      So let's-let's show       
    you what it looks like.     

00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,770
 So, Mac App inspection, like I 
 said, will show up right next  

00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:30,375
      to your iOS devices       
      in the Develop menu.      

00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,278
  In this case, I have two Mac  
 Apps and the second one here,  

00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,149
JSPong, is a JavaScriptCore app.

00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:40,485
  The first one is a web view   

00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,370
       but they're right        
      there side by side.       

00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:44,355
 They're first class citizens.  

00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,958
      And like I said, you      
     can also still connect     

00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,194
    to your iOS applications    
         and iOS Safari         

00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:52,730
  from the same Develop menu.   

00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,251
   But for Mac App inspection   
         we require you         

00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,622
     to add an entitlement      
          to your app.          

00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:03,908
   You don't want anyone else   
   debugging your JavaScript    

00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,644
      context or stealing       
      your JavaScript code      

00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,497
   from your Mac Application    
 that you've worked so hard on. 

00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,201
 So we require you to have this 
entitlement on your applications

00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,604
that you're developing locally. 

00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:19,691
   And it's very simple to do   
    and I'll give you a demo    

00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,610
  of it here in a little bit.   

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,963
 But what about JavaScriptCore  
          inspection?           

00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,482
     What's that look like?     

00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,752
      Well, it looks just       
    like the Web Inspector.     

00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,305
 This is the same Web Inspector 
 that you saw a little bit ago. 

00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:36,958
       The other one was        
       for the web view.        

00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,193
 This one is for JavaScriptCore 
            context.            

00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,996
There's a couple of buttons that
  are missing that don't apply  

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,399
to JavaScriptCore context like, 

00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,668
       styles and the DOM       
     and things like that.      

00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,821
     But for the most part      
    it's everything you need    

00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,874
  to debug your JavaScriptCore  
          application.          

00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,344
 And you have the full console. 

00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,748
  You can do a REPL, evaluate   
JavaScript or see console.logs. 

00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,503
Console.log is now available in 
your JavaScriptCore application.

00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,407
  So if you have your own log   
function you can now abandon it 

00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,577
  and start using console.log   
 and get all the great benefits 

00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,430
     of the Web Inspector's     
         Log functions.         

00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,666
 But if you don't do anything,  

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,220
   the console is pretty much   
    all you have available.     

00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:24,505
     And I'll tell you why.     

00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,424
       We don't know what       
       you're evaluating        

00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,793
in your JavaScriptCore context. 

00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:30,995
      If you're evaluating      
         large scripts,         

00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:32,847
    those are something you     
     probably want to debug     

00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,084
  but you could be evaluating   
something every 200 milliseconds

00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:39,904
     and that would quickly     
   pollute the sidebar here.    

00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,607
       So you-any script        
     that you want to debug     

00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,194
  in the Web Inspector we will  
    need you to supply a URL    

00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,431
      or just a plain name      
        for that script.        

00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,235
     And we've given you a      
   couple new APIs for this.    

00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,356
   There has always been the    
   EvaluateScript functions.    

00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,477
 We now have a new Objective-C  
  one that takes a sourceURL,   

00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,530
and this URL can be a file URL. 

00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,231
       It can be any URL.       

00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,917
    The Web Inspector really    
     doesn't take it other      

00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,321
      than to get the name      
         at this point.         

00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,040
But if it's a file URL, it will 
have a little bit extra benefit 

00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:18,843
      and I'll talk to you      
    about that a little bit,    

00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:22,247
    but JSEvaluateScript has    
 always supported the sourceURL 

00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,400
      but a lot of people       
     just pass null to it.      

00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,852
       So if you're using       
         the old C API,         

00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,605
   make sure to start passing   
     a sourceURL for things     

00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,124
     that you want to debug     
    that way they will show     

00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,243
    up in the Web Inspector.    

00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,278
    And that's for scripts.     

00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,013
  But what about your context?  

00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,165
Identifying a context is pretty 
   difficult with JavaScript.   

00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:43,968
   We don't know what it is.    

00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,071
  By default it will just say   
 JSContext in the Develop menu. 

00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,141
   But if you have a multiple   
    context, you don't want     

00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,361
    to see a list that says     
JSContext, JSContext, JSContext,

00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:56,798
  you want to identify those.   

00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,567
   And as the developer, you    
 should know what you're using  

00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:02,203
      that context for and      
    we provide this new API     

00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:04,922
       that allows you to       
       name your context.       

00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,241
      And the name is only      
      used for debugging.       

00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:09,560
    It will only show up in     
     Safari's Develop menu.     

00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,647
       So let's just give       
        a demo of this.         

00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:16,901
 So I have a sample application 
  that we released a while ago  

00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:21,406
  at a previous WWDC: JSPong.   

00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:24,459
  And it's a simple pong game.  

00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:27,478
 But I have some things I need  
  to do to it to make it work   

00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:30,398
   with JSContext inspection.   

00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:32,650
  The first thing I need to do  
  is make sure the entitlement  

00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:34,435
           is there.            

00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:35,586
And if you're in the Apps Store,

00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:37,522
   you probably already have    
     an entitlements file.      

00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:39,941
    In this case, I already     
      have an App Sandbox       

00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,226
       and that will give       
       me an entitlement.       

00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,479
And I have it right here in the 
 sidebar, JSPong.entitlements.  

00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:50,401
   So let's go in and add the   
   entitlement that we need.    

00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:57,458
       And I said it was        
      com.apple.security.       

00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:04,716
      get-task-allow, and       
        it's a Boolean.         

00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:10,154
       And we'll go ahead       
         and say "Yes."         

00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,792
   So that's all I need to do   

00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,528
       to allow JSContext       
 inspection in my application.  

00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:20,014
And I'll go ahead and save that.

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,184
       And I'll go ahead        
     and build and run it.      

00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:26,854
     And it's a very simple     
           pong game.           

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,240
      The AI is controlled      
        by a JavaScript         

00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:31,309
      that you can modify       
        here in the app.        

00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,277
        I'm not going to        
        talk about that.        

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,315
   But now I can go to Safari   
   and, in the Develop menu,    

00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:43,321
 I will see Mac Pro and I will  
  see JSPong and my JSContext.  

00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:47,408
       And I didn't name        
        the context yet,        

00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,510
      so it's getting the       
         default name.          

00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:51,412
       And I'll go ahead        
       and inspect that.        

00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,414
       And you'll see the       
      resources are empty.      

00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,801
    I'm not seeing that that    
  AI script that I've loaded.   

00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,621
 But I-if I want to debug that, 
 I'll need to give that a name. 

00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,425
   But at this point, I have    
     access to the console.     

00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:07,144
   If you don't do anything,    

00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,697
     you can do evaluations     
      here in the console.      

00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,067
       You can get access       
         to any globals         

00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,587
      that you might have       
   available in your context.   

00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:20,691
  And you will see exceptions   
      in logs and errors.       

00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,345
      And in this case, we      
   have an example exception    

00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:26,797
       and this will give       
       you a back trace,        

00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,600
  not just of your JavaScript,  
    but of your native code.    

00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,237
     So you can see exactly     
      where that function       

00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:36,524
  or script was evaluated all   
  the way to your native codes  

00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,044
    so you can trace it back    
    to the exist-the origin.    

00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:46,384
  So let's go back into Xcode   
    and name some of these.     

00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:49,971
     So it's pretty simple.     

00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:51,088
  I'll just comment this out.   

00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,274
       This will name my        
     context, Pong Context.     

00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:55,493
    I only have one context.    

00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:56,794
  But if I had multiple ones,   

00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,563
     it would be imperative     
      for me to name them.      

00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,751
    And when I'm evaluating     
         the AI script,         

00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:07,071
        all I have to do        
      is construct a URL.       

00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:09,974
     In this case, I'm just     
   making a URL with a string   

00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,260
     and it really doesn't      
        have a location.        

00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:17,164
     And I'll just use the      
    new withSourceURL method    

00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:21,185
     and pass in that URL.      

00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,655
    Now let's build and run     
      and see what happens      

00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:27,291
     in the Web Inspector.      

00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:32,196
       We'll go ahead and       
  reconnect to the pong game.   

00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:36,501
    In the Resource sidebar,    
  we now have that AI script.   

00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,955
   And in the app, we didn't    
      syntax highlight it.      

00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:43,408
       But Web Inspector        
       knows exactly how        

00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:45,376
to syntax highlight JavaScript. 

00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:48,062
   So we can set breakpoints    
          right here.           

00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:52,333
 And since the script is called 
every iteration of the movement,

00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:55,520
  it should break right away.   

00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,255
  And now I'm in the debugger.  

00:25:58,491 --> 00:25:59,957
I have access to the call stack.

00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:02,943
   There's nothing other than   
  this function being called.   

00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:05,396
       But if there was a       
   deeply nested call stack,    

00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:07,682
     you would see it right     
     there in the sidebar.      

00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:11,536
 And I can also bring open the  
  scope chain and we can-just   

00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,139
       like you would any       
      JavaScript context,       

00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,059
you can now inspect the objects 
   that you're getting passed   

00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:22,196
     around or your global      
      scope in this case.       

00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:27,552
     And we can do what any     
debugger does and step through, 

00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,373
   and do anything you would    
    do in a normal debugger,    

00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,660
    in addition to hovering     
         over variables         

00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:39,030
      to see their current      
    value or evaluate things    

00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,617
     in this current scope      
        in the console.         

00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:48,873
   So in this case, let's try   
    modifying the ball here.    

00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,297
    Maybe we want to modify     
     the rules of pong here     

00:26:58,017 --> 00:26:59,533
       and make something       
      really easy to hit.       

00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:01,869
       So I've gone ahead       
       and modified that.       

00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:06,273
 And I have an update function  
here that will redraw my scene. 

00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,262
      And you can see the       
     ball increase in size      

00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:13,948
        as I may-after I        
       made that change.        

00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:16,934
    And this is working with    
  Objective-C bridged objects.  

00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,771
   The ball object here is a    
   bridged Objective-C object   

00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,709
 that you can use as you would  
  a normal JavaScript object.   

00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:29,864
So that's JSContext inspection. 

00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:31,832
 And we'll go ahead and play it 

00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:33,951
  and the ball stays the same   
    size and keeps on going.    

00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:39,307
  So again, any web view, any   
JavaScript context that you have

00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,127
    in your application can     
    be debugged now as long     

00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:45,346
     as you have the right      
          entitlement.          

00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,197
 And this also applies for iOS. 

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,117
 So only builds that you build  
   and run on to your device    

00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:53,571
   or into the iOS simulator    
      will be inspectable.      

00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:56,407
      Any app from the App      
   Store will not be allowed    

00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,126
to be inspected by anyone else. 

00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:01,979
    So that's all you need.     

00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,765
  And again, name your context  
     and name your scripts,     

00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,484
   so you can easily identify   
  them when you're debugging.   

00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,672
    So now let's talk about     
    something that we've had    

00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:16,594
    in the Web Inspector for    
     a while: the Timeline.     

00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:20,014
  And something new this year   
 is the Source Code Timelines.  

00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,099
   So what do I mean by that?   

00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,501
     What sorts of problems     
         does it solve?         

00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,923
 So Source Code Timelines help  
   you answer this question.    

00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:33,895
   What happened when I click   
   on something on the page?    

00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:37,231
    Maybe it's a new project    
    that you're working on,     

00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,183
      maybe it's something      
      you wrote years ago       

00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,268
 and you don't remember how it  
  worked and you want to find   

00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,355
 that line of code that handles 
this click, so you can fix a bug

00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:48,542
   or so you can just modify    
    it for some new behavior    

00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,413
      that your client is       
       asking you to add.       

00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,115
  So, when this click happens,  
     there's a lot of stuff     

00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:57,218
    that probably going on.     

00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:59,520
    But you really only care    
   about code that you wrote,   

00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,606
 maybe you have some analytics  
  code or a lot of other code   

00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,259
        that it might be        
        hard to decipher        

00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,729
  or see interleaved functions  
and event calls and all of these

00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,334
      that happen in a big      
    modern web application.     

00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:18,739
    So when I click on that,    
   you start wondering, "OK,    

00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,494
    what script is handling     
         this button?"          

00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,564
And it turns out it's this one. 

00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,317
      But with the new Web      
 Inspector, we can dig deeper.  

00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,622
  In the script, I can now see  
   a timeline representation    

00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,276
 of what the script was doing.  

00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,629
  So I can see over time where  
the mouse events are coming in, 

00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:44,798
    where the clicks events,    
   where the timer was added,   

00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,067
  where the timers are firing,  

00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,386
        where I might be        
      doing forced layout,      

00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:53,641
  which is a pretty evil thing  
   to do in a modern web app.   

00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:58,129
    So what's it looked like    
     in the Web Inspector?      

00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:01,766
      Well, here's the new      
    Web Inspector Timeline.     

00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:06,854
 And you can see in the sidebar 
here we have all of our scripts 

00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:11,976
  and resources from the page   
 broken out in their hierarchy  

00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:16,630
   of how they're included by   
you, the developer, in the page 

00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:21,485
       and you can expand       
    each script to see what     

00:30:23,756 --> 00:30:25,806
   that script was doing and    
  where the line of code was.   

00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,310
    And in this case, you'll    
      see a whole timeline      

00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:31,729
        where things are        
     happening repeatedly.      

00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:33,814
      You'll start seeing       
     patterns and allow you     

00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:36,634
  to identify problem areas if  
 something is firing too much,  

00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,788
   too little, not at all, if   
 you don't see it in the list.  

00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:44,992
 And if you want to dig deeper  
  into the code, all you have   

00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:47,845
      to do is click right      
      there on the sidebar      

00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:50,564
 and it will take you right to  
that location, and you can mouse

00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,101
up and down through the sidebar 
 and have your code on one side 

00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,237
       and your timeline        
      data in the sidebar.      

00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,007
 So you can get a good overview 

00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,143
     of what the script is      
      doing really quick.       

00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:06,897
      So that's the Source      
         Code Timelines         

00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,517
    and I'll give you a demo    
    here in a little minute.    

00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:13,354
  So something else that's new  

00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,207
      in the Web Inspector      
     is Breakpoint Probes.      

00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:20,127
     So you might have some     
   information that you want    

00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:23,797
       to know when that        
        mouse is clicked        

00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,533
 or when your mouse is moving.  

00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:29,320
  And those things are kind of  
 hard to debug in the debugger. 

00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,022
    You often have to resort    
      to printf debugging       

00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,708
   because you don't want to    
constantly be switching context 

00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:39,263
    between your app in the     
  page and the Web Inspector.   

00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,951
 So you often result to printf  
debugging and you're cluttering 

00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:47,238
 up your console with thousands 
     of lines and it's hard     

00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,474
   to decipher, especially if   
you're debugging multiple areas 

00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,794
      that are not related      
       and you don't care       

00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:56,914
   about the interloop data.    

00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,566
        So this is where        
  Breakpoint Probes comes in.   

00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:02,770
     It let's you see these     
 properties that you might care 

00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,123
    about without having to     
breakout into the Web Inspector.

00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:09,710
     So let's just go ahead     
    and give a demo of this.    

00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:13,380
  So let's go to Safari here.   

00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,551
      And I have a simple       
      stack the block game      

00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:25,042
that I want to-it's been a while
since this was written so I want

00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:28,112
    to see what's going on.     

00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:30,381
   Let's go ahead and use the   
    Timeline panel for this.    

00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:33,150
    I'll go ahead and bring     
      up the Web Inspector      

00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:36,487
      in the Develop menu,      
      show Web Inspector.       

00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:40,007
      And we'll go to the       
        Timeline panel.         

00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,209
      And by default, the       
       Timeline is empty.       

00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,127
It's not recording all the time.

00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,064
   And it only automatically    
records when you reload the page

00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:51,051
  or when you press the Record  
 button up here in the corner.  

00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:54,271
      And this can record       
       any length of time       

00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:56,574
 that you would like to record. 

00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,726
       But when you-when        
       I reload the page,       

00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:00,728
      it will only record       
         a little bit.          

00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:03,130
 So I'm just going to go ahead  
    and start recording here    

00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,450
and see what this page is doing 
 as I interact with this game.  

00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:10,054
       And you'll see the       
    events and all the work     

00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:12,923
       that the engine is       
       doing in response        

00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:15,960
     to these events start      
  filling up on the Timeline.   

00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,730
And I'll go ahead and stop this.

00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,717
  And my application has three  
 scripts, but the logic is all  

00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,354
  in blocks.js, all the other   
    stuff is stuff I didn't     

00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:29,439
          even write.           

00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:30,874
       I don't even know        
     what's going on there.     

00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,293
   So I can ignore those, but   
    they're doing some work.    

00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,063
       And normally that        
    would clutter up my UI.     

00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:39,199
 But they're collapsed here, so 
they're not taking up any space.

00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:42,920
  I'll go ahead and expand the  
 script that I care about here  

00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:48,242
 and I can see that Timers are  
 firing pretty-at a pretty good 

00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,864
  clip as I'm interacting with  
the page and there's key events 

00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:57,501
     that are firing every      
      time I press a key.       

00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,354
     Some of the other new      
 features of the timeline here, 

00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,791
 we can now zoom and scale the  
 overview panel so if you want  

00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:08,696
 to dig in to see where things  
 are happening across domains.  

00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:13,133
  In this case, we have three   
Timelines, the Network Request, 

00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:15,769
     Layout and Rendering,      
        and JavaScript.         

00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:19,423
 And all three play a key role  
in the performance of your page.

00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:23,310
     So if you see anything     
     interesting happening      

00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,613
   in a specific time range,    
     you can zoom in on it,     

00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,017
   make a selection and that    
     information will show      

00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,137
   up below in the Timeline.    

00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,507
   And you can also drag this   
   around to scroll and scrub   

00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:41,378
  through your time as things   
  were happening on the page.   

00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,451
 So in this case, let me reload 
and I'll show you the networks. 

00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,189
       And in this case,        
       it's a local file.       

00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,642
  But we now have network load  
 information and you see those  

00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:58,695
    on the network timeline     
       and you'll notice        

00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:01,114
     that the Timeline just     
      automatically stops       

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,482
        recording there.        

00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:03,684
        It records up to        
        a certain amount        

00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:06,120
  of time unless you manually   
  hit the Record button again   

00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,206
  to record more information.   

00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:12,009
     So let's look into the     
     network timeline here.     

00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,695
     And we can see all of      
      the network details       

00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:16,630
   that you might be familiar   

00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:18,766
      with in the previous      
       network timeline.        

00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,669
   They're all there and you    
  can sort-sort these columns   

00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:24,672
    by whatever information     
   you find most interesting.   

00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,075
    If you're looking for a     
   large script, you can sort   

00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,545
    by transfer size and see    
    the biggest script show     

00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:34,281
        up right there.         

00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,983
  Let's go back to start time.  

00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,087
     You can also do-click      
     on the other timelines     

00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:43,123
and get detailed tab-linear data

00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:45,943
     of what was happening      
      in that time range.       

00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:48,295
       And again this is        
     all time range-based.      

00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:51,482
So you can see, as these layout 
and rendering events filter out,

00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,769
      they disappear from       
       the display below.       

00:35:57,923 --> 00:35:59,840
     JavaScript and Events      
       is a special view.       

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,427
     And if you're looking      
   for the old profile data,    

00:36:05,097 --> 00:36:06,046
  this is where it's moved to.  

00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:09,133
So as you're recording Timeline,
 we would now capture profiles  

00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,619
   of all those entry points    
     into your JavaScript.      

00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,456
So whenever script is evaluated,
you can expand these to see all 

00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:20,711
     of the functions that      
   were called in your script   

00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:24,364
     and how much time each     
individual function took to make

00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:27,884
        up that piece of        
       that entry point.        

00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,438
       So that's a brief        
    glance at the Timeline.     

00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,407
  But there is one cool thing   
   that people always forget    

00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,810
       about when they're       
  talking about the Timeline.   

00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:38,929
     And that's the Filter.     

00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,732
       The Filter bar is        
    vastly underappreciated     

00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:45,736
 in the Web Inspector and even  
   Xcode where it comes from,   

00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,006
      where you can filter      
         down this list         

00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:51,792
 to find what exactly you want. 

00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:54,845
  So, in this case I'd look-I   
     did a filter for event     

00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:57,514
 and it found addEventListener  
          right there           

00:36:58,617 --> 00:36:59,283
and it brought it to the front. 

00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:01,034
       It expanded those        
     profiles and showed me     

00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,453
      that exact function       
       I was looking for.       

00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,190
      So that's the Filter      
    Bar and I encourage you     

00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:08,459
    to start using filtering    
           more often           

00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:10,260
      in the Web Inspector      
        and even Xcode.         

00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,529
      We'll go back to my       
       block application        

00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,232
and bring up the Web Inspector. 

00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:19,987
  And let's go ahead and go to  
   the Resource sidebar here.   

00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,876
  And I really want to improve  
this key function listener-this 

00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,229
         key listener.          

00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:31,765
      It's using key code,      
    which is pretty arcane.     

00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:34,818
    And there's some new API    
   key identifier that's been   

00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:37,120
 out for years that I could use 

00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:39,472
     that would give string     
        representations         

00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:43,159
     of these-for my cases      
    instead of the numbers.     

00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,164
 So what I'll do, like I said,  
when we set a breakpoint anytime

00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,385
    that key is pressed it's    
 going to interrupt my process. 

00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,405
   So now to do another key,    
     I have to hit Continue     

00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:57,891
     and log what I wanted.     

00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:00,711
 And press another key, figure  
    out what I'm doing here.    

00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:05,382
  But with this breakpoint we   
  can add a breakpoint action.  

00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:10,387
And I'll go ahead and edit this 
  breakpoint, which will bring  

00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,174
       up the breakpoint        
        Action popover.         

00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:17,561
       And let's go ahead       
        and add a probe.        

00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:20,297
        So we have a few        
       actions available.       

00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:21,882
  I'm not going to cover them.  

00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:23,633
       But they're pretty       
       self-explanatory.        

00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:26,119
      Probe Expression in       
    this case is brand new.     

00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:29,239
     And we'll go ahead and     
     evaluate an expression     

00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:31,658
   that we're interested in.    

00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:34,861
 And we have an an event object 
  here and I want to know what  

00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:38,348
    that key identifier is.     

00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:41,351
 And that's all I need to type. 

00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,871
  And I want to automatically   
   continue after evaluating    

00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:47,708
      so it doesn't pause       
        in the debugger.        

00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,595
     So we'll go ahead and      
       break out in here.       

00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,014
  And when I added that probe,  

00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:56,499
     it added a new sidebar     
      item called Probes.       

00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,953
  And this is where that data   
   will show up in the table.   

00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,090
   So I'm going to go back to   
 my game and interact with it.  

00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:08,011
 And now it's logging that key  
 identifier every time I press  

00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,364
      the key and showing       
         me the values          

00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:15,051
  that I can now take an input  
into my code and improve my code

00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:19,105
  and I didn't-this would have  
 been a back and forth process  

00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,559
   or a lot of assumption of    
  what these identifiers were.  

00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:25,195
     Now I can see them all     
     in a table and go back     

00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:28,164
  to my case and modify them.   

00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,502
       So that's Probes.        

00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:35,088
     So that's a little bit     
    about Breakpoint Probes     

00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:37,374
   and Source Code Timelines.   

00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:39,275
     And I encourage you to     
     play around with them      

00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,495
    and see how they can fit    
 into your debugging workflow.  

00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,184
       So now let's talk        
      about Accessibility.      

00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:49,536
  A new in the Web Inspector,   

00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:52,022
    we have an Accessibility    
         Details View.          

00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,159
      And this is pretty,       
       pretty important.        

00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:00,063
       If you're working        
      on a major website,       

00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:02,782
   you want to be accessible    
          to everyone.          

00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:05,135
       Apple cares a lot        
      about accessibility.      

00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,772
   And we do a lot of work to   
   make accessibility matter.   

00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,443
   But it only goes so far as   
  to how much you put into it   

00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,997
     when you're developing     
     your own applications.     

00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:19,483
       And that goes for        
        iOS applications        

00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:21,968
     and web applications.      

00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:24,955
    And on the web, we have     
     something called ARIA.     

00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:28,141
     And it's recently hit      
       a milestone ARIA 1       

00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,061
       or it's about to.        

00:40:32,364 --> 00:40:34,965
     And that allows you to     
   define for a DOM node what   

00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:38,852
 that DOM node does as a role.  

00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:41,688
      And those roles are       
     translated into things     

00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,959
   that the person using the    
computer with VoiceOver can hear

00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,264
     or see with your-with      
     your web application.      

00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:55,352
       And in this case,        
        I have a webpage        

00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:58,572
       that has an alert,       
         an HTML alert.         

00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,392
   And those are notoriously    
     hard to debug or hard      

00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:07,113
   for a sighted-non-sighted    
  person to see when they pop   

00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,801
up in a webpage because they're 
  not going to be able to see   

00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:17,057
    that content unless you     
  annotate it with ARIA roles.  

00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:22,462
     And in this case, the      
      VoiceOver machinery       

00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:27,200
and the Accessibility machinery 
   in web view exposes a lot    

00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:30,987
     of details like child      
         relationships.         

00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:33,974
  And these relationships are   
    not necessarily the same    

00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:37,110
      as a normal DOM node      
          relationship          

00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,064
   where your parent could be   
  someone that's deeply-a deep  

00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:44,701
        ancestor of you.        

00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:47,571
       And we show those        
      in the sidebar here       

00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,073
as a parent-child relationship. 

00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:51,391
   And they're all linkable.    

00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:53,009
       So I can click on        
      them and go directly      

00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:56,646
   to these other child nodes   
   that are part of my alert.   

00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:00,984
  And see that this button has  
  the right role for a button.  

00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:04,638
  And it will allow people-it   
won't allow people to focus it, 

00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:07,474
      but it allows people      
          to click it.          

00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:10,176
       And that's a brief       
   summary of what you can do   

00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:13,346
     with the Web Inspector     
       and Accessibility.       

00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:15,682
       There's a session        
        tomorrow morning        

00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:18,168
   that covers Accessibility    
          and the web.          

00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:20,637
      And I encourage you       
      to go check it out.       

00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:23,223
    If you have a website or    
     a web view in your iOS     

00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,093
   or Mac application, please   
     do make it accessible.     

00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:32,232
So that's accessibility details.

00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:35,218
      Now let's talk about      
  something that's really fun,  

00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:38,204
        which is Color.         

00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,957
Color is one of those things-we 

00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:44,260
    as people can understand    
            numbers.            

00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,714
      But colors, there's       
       millions of them.        

00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,334
    And it's very visual and    
    a very personal process     

00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:54,571
  of picking the right color.   

00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:58,074
   And if you're like me and    
  you're working on a webpage,  

00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:01,378
        you might have a        
    client come in and say,     

00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:04,848
   "I want this color salmon"   
     or "this color taupe."     

00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:10,103
It's hard for them to take those
  words and you can translate   

00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:13,757
   that into the right color.   

00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:15,675
  Wouldn't it be great if you   
  can just bring up the color,  

00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:17,644
      pick it right there       
         in the webpage         

00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,063
      and modify it right       
    there in front of them.     

00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:22,498
   So that's what we've added   
     in the Web Inspector,      

00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:24,284
   and I'll give you a demo.    

00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,586
     So I have an icon that     
     I've been mocking up.      

00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,472
      And often I do these      
       things in the web        

00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:31,825
    because that's something    
         I understand.          

00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:33,960
       I can play around        
      with it a lot easier      

00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,329
       than maybe I could       
        do in Photoshop.        

00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:39,232
And this icon is a little small 
so I'll just go ahead and bring 

00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:43,019
   up the Web Inspector here.   

00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,357
       And I have a class       
         that I can add         

00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:50,877
      to make it a little       
        bigger for you.         

00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:53,212
    So, now I have my icon.     

00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:54,797
    It has a couple colors.     

00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,115
      It's got this color       
         for the glyph          

00:43:56,901 --> 00:43:58,067
    and it's got a gradient     
       in the background.       

00:43:59,237 --> 00:44:02,872
    I can bring up the Style    
 sidebar and see those colors.  

00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:08,378
     And in this case, I'm      
    using some named colors.    

00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:11,347
        CSS has hundreds        
        of named colors.        

00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,666
       But maybe it's not       
        the right teal.         

00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:16,286
      That's a little more      
     green than I expected      

00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:20,190
      or the light blue is      
      not enough sea foam       

00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:24,661
   or whatever your client is   
telling you to make this color. 

00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:30,266
So, I can click on these colors 
swatches and get a Color Editor.

00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,922
      Or I can switch over      
      to the CSS resource       

00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:39,592
       and get the exact        
        same experience.        

00:44:41,246 --> 00:44:42,679
   But in this case, we want    
  your source code to be front  

00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:45,715
  and center, so we don't even  
   add those color swatches.    

00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:48,351
   But we have a new feature    

00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:51,554
    that let you get a data     
   detector-like experience.    

00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:54,491
      When we detect that       
         it's a color,          

00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,577
   we will show a color wheel   
  next to it as you hover it.   

00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:01,264
       And when you click       
         on that wheel,         

00:45:02,634 --> 00:45:03,917
 we bring up the color popover. 

00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,469
      And in this case we       
    could just click around     

00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:09,205
   and you can see the color    
   updating live right there    

00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:11,908
        in the web page.        

00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:14,494
 And I can find the right color 

00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:17,514
        that I'm looking        
      for, for this glyph.      

00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:20,583
   And if it's a named color    
      it will default back      

00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:22,819
   to the named color syntax.   

00:45:23,655 --> 00:45:24,537
   But if it's not something    
         that's named,          

00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:27,540
     it will just give you      
     the RGB syntax or RGBa     

00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:31,177
    if you picked an alpha.     

00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:33,947
   But we didn't stop there.    

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,499
  We now let you do gradients.  

00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:39,602
  And gradients are even more   
  hard to visualize than color  

00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:42,405
because you have that interplay 

00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,974
  of the colors transitioning   
      from one to another.      

00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:48,177
      And it's hard to see      
      those in your mind.       

00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:51,664
      But we can go ahead       
    and edit this gradient.     

00:45:53,518 --> 00:45:55,135
And it gives you a simple slider

00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:58,655
   that you might be familiar   
      with from other UIs.      

00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:01,491
  And I can drag these around   

00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:03,877
  and you'll see it's updating  
the source code as I drag this. 

00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:06,312
  The percentage is changing.   

00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:08,531
     And when I let go, it      
     updates the page live.     

00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:12,519
   So I can see exactly what    
   is applying to this page.    

00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,806
       But you can't just       
     edit the color stops.      

00:46:18,343 --> 00:46:22,095
    You can edit the type of    
gradient or you can pick radial 

00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,266
       so it's coming out       
        from the center.        

00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:30,219
    And I can click on these    
 colors and get the color wheel 

00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:33,906
   and start editing each of    
  these color stops directly.   

00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,144
    So I can find the exact     
     look I'm looking for.      

00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:43,032
       Drag this around.        

00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:47,737
    Maybe we'll run it to be    
  more of the starburst look.   

00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:52,942
   A little bit more yellow.    

00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,778
 Or the client might say, "Oh,  

00:46:57,582 --> 00:46:58,948
    I want a linear gradient    
         in this case."         

00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:01,818
    So let's go back to the     
      traditional iOS look      

00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:06,673
for gradients and start picking 
 some pretty wild colors here.  

00:47:10,028 --> 00:47:12,629
 So that's the gradient editor  
   at the new Web Inspector.    

00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:20,103
And what I didn't show you here,
 let's go back and reload here. 

00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:31,414
        If I make any of        
      these changes, say,       

00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,418
 I want to go back and save it. 

00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:39,388
     Let's make this a red      
      and that looks good.      

00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,291
   That looks like a sunset.    

00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:45,128
  In the Web Inspector, I can   
just go ahead and hit Command+S 

00:47:46,798 --> 00:47:48,131
     that will bring up the     
   traditional Save dialogue.   

00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:50,333
    Go ahead and replace it.    

00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,752
  And now, if I close the Web   
  Inspector, reload the page,   

00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:55,922
      I have that gradient      
       color right there.       

00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:58,958
  The icon is a different size  
because I was modifying the DOM 

00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,194
   and it that doesn't save.    

00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:03,146
     But if you're editing      
         a CSS resource         

00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:05,999
or any other local file resource
 you can save those right back  

00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:09,335
to disk from the Web Inspector. 

00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:11,821
      So that's Color and       
       Gradient Editing.        

00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:13,906
   And I hope you play around   
    with it and try it out.     

00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:17,844
It's really fun to just get down
  and dirty with those colors.  

00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:21,998
        And the gradient        
      syntax is something       

00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:24,467
       that I still have        
      trouble remembering.      

00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:26,803
   But the Web inspector will   
   just help you right there    

00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:29,739
       and get the right        
     syntax and let you go      

00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:32,675
    on to do more important     
      things in your code.      

00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:36,012
     So that's the summary      
    of all the new features,    

00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:39,265
 and just a brief introduction  

00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:41,885
    of all the new features     
     in the Web Inspector.      

00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:45,922
      So, I encourage you       
       to take advantage        

00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,508
     of the new JavaScript      
       language features.       

00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,995
 As you're able to release and  
  use the new modern browsers,  

00:48:54,399 --> 00:48:57,217
  or use iOS 8 exclusively, or  
  Mac OS Yosemite exclusively,  

00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:00,603
   you could start using some   

00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:02,638
     of these new language      
      and syntax features.      

00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:06,826
      The Web Inspector is      
      now available again       

00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,195
  from your Mac Applications.   

00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:10,830
     If you have a web view     
   that you've always wanted    

00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:12,799
     to see what it's doing     
      in your application,      

00:49:13,885 --> 00:49:14,584
       there's been a few       
         ways to do it.         

00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,569
   But you can now officially   
     use the web inspector      

00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:19,238
    in your Mac Application.    

00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,091
       And I want you to        
      enjoy debugging your      

00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:24,093
      JavaScript context.       

00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:25,962
       This is something        
     that may seem simple.      

00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,080
Oh yeah, there's now a debugger.

00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:30,566
     But, yeah, now there's     
          a debugger.           

00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:33,770
     You can now debug this     
JavaScript that's been plaguing 

00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:37,674
  you or giving you this weird  
errors or it's always been hard 

00:49:40,078 --> 00:49:41,794
to debug these contexts because 
there's been no debugger that's 

00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:45,581
       been able to give        
     you that information.      

00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:48,868
And again, it's really important

00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:51,204
        to make your web        
    applications accessible     

00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:53,873
    and your iOS application    
          accessible.           

00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:56,559
   And be a colorful person.    

00:49:57,695 --> 00:49:59,495
 Enjoy color editing in the Web 
Inspector and gradient editing. 

00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:03,800
And again, for more information,
   you can contact Evangelism   

00:50:06,304 --> 00:50:08,655
 at this email address, or the  
  Developer Technical support,  

00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:11,674
   and even the Apple Forums.   

00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:13,242
    I'm in the Apple Forums     
     if you have a question     

00:50:14,145 --> 00:50:15,578
    about the Web Inspector,    
    or anything web-related,    

00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:19,182
   or one of our team will be   
 able to answer it or I would.  

00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,585
      There-Again, there's      
     a couple more sessions     

00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:25,755
 that might interest you as web 
  developers or iOS developers  

00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,292
        that have web or        
      JavaScript context.       

00:50:30,895 --> 00:50:32,195
       You can go to the        
    session tomorrow morning    

00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:34,664
   and learn all you need to    
    know about accessibility    

00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:36,549
    in your web application.    

00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:38,751
     And then stay in that      
      same room and learn       

00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:42,271
  about responsive web design   
 for making your web apps scale 

00:50:44,308 --> 00:50:45,691
       from desktop size        
        to iPhone size.         

00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:47,660
         And that's it.         

00:50:48,246 --> 00:50:48,828
         Thanks a lot.          

00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:50,446
          [ Applause ]
