[ Applause ]

00:00:14.526 --> 00:00:14.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:17.996 A:middle
Welcome to Debugging in Xcode 6.

00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:21.046 A:middle
So if you had seen our
debugging session last year,

00:00:21.726 --> 00:00:22.796 A:middle
you would have noticed our quest

00:00:22.796 --> 00:00:25.906 A:middle
to bring more relative debugging
information to your fingertips.

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.286 A:middle
This year, we're going to
continue with this mission.

00:00:29.376 --> 00:00:31.686 A:middle
Oh, before I forget, my
colleague reminded me

00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:35.276 A:middle
to introduce myself, but my name
has not changed from last year,

00:00:35.376 --> 00:00:38.316 A:middle
so I'm still Han Ming Ong and
I'm still Debugger UI Engineer.

00:00:39.676 --> 00:00:43.826 A:middle
So, let's briefly look
at what we're going

00:00:43.826 --> 00:00:45.066 A:middle
to talk about this year.

00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:49.116 A:middle
I'm going to talk about
a new feature in Xcode 6

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:52.436 A:middle
that will help you
with debugging your use

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:54.776 A:middle
of Grand Central
Dispatch which is GCD.

00:00:54.816 --> 00:00:58.146 A:middle
This feature is called
Queue Debugging.

00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:02.596 A:middle
Next up, Troy is going to come
up and show you amazing new way


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:02.596 A:middle
Next up, Troy is going to come
up and show you amazing new way

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:05.586 A:middle
to explore and debug
your user interface.

00:01:06.436 --> 00:01:08.116 A:middle
And then Kerry is going
to talk in detail,

00:01:08.496 --> 00:01:10.606 A:middle
how to integrate your --

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:12.546 A:middle
the Quick Look Preview
into your custom class.

00:01:16.546 --> 00:01:18.606 A:middle
I want to set the stage
for Queue Debugging

00:01:19.136 --> 00:01:20.596 A:middle
so that we're all
on the same page.

00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:23.086 A:middle
My apologies if this
is a bit of --

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:26.476 A:middle
a bit of it too basic for some
of you, but it's important

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:27.876 A:middle
that we get the fundamentals
right.

00:01:29.136 --> 00:01:34.836 A:middle
So, when your application hits a
break point, the program pauses.

00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:38.386 A:middle
The debugger will go through
a process known as unwinding.

00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:41.476 A:middle
What it does is, it
looks at the method

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:42.726 A:middle
that contains your break point,

00:01:43.106 --> 00:01:46.036 A:middle
and follows the thread
pointer back to the call site.

00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:48.336 A:middle
In this case, awakeFromNib.

00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:52.966 A:middle
It goes on until it reaches
the beginning of the thread.

00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:54.876 A:middle
Then it comes back with a series

00:01:54.876 --> 00:01:56.986 A:middle
of stack frames known
as a backtrace.

00:01:57.646 --> 00:02:01.906 A:middle
So a stack frame is an instance
of location of your method.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:57.646 --> 00:02:01.906 A:middle
So a stack frame is an instance
of location of your method.

00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:04.066 A:middle
Now backtraces are important

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:06.406 A:middle
because it helps you
understand the control flow

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:08.076 A:middle
and the state of
your application.

00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:14.606 A:middle
So what happens -- how
does GCD impact backtraces?

00:02:15.546 --> 00:02:16.976 A:middle
But first, what is GCD?

00:02:17.786 --> 00:02:21.336 A:middle
It is a technology
that is introduced five

00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:23.736 A:middle
or six years ago, in the
Snow Leopard timeframe.

00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:27.006 A:middle
Since then, it has
taken off like wildfire

00:02:27.106 --> 00:02:31.576 A:middle
because it is a very natural
way to create concurrent,

00:02:31.576 --> 00:02:32.796 A:middle
responsive application.

00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:36.866 A:middle
Basically you divide your task

00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:40.136 A:middle
up into smaller work
items called blocks.

00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:45.686 A:middle
And then you enqueue the block
to a queue using two ways:

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:49.296 A:middle
synchronously or asynchronously.

00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:51.576 A:middle
We're going to focus
on the latter

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:53.986 A:middle
because it poses
a bigger challenge

00:02:54.436 --> 00:02:55.276 A:middle
when it comes to debugging.

00:02:56.616 --> 00:03:00.046 A:middle
You enqueue asynchronously
using the dispatch async API.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:56.616 --> 00:03:00.046 A:middle
You enqueue asynchronously
using the dispatch async API.

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:06.586 A:middle
And then what you're
telling the system, the OS,

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:11.136 A:middle
is at some time later, it
can be dequeue your block

00:03:11.446 --> 00:03:14.086 A:middle
and find a worker thread
to start executing it.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.246 A:middle
Imagine that you've
hit a breakpoint

00:03:18.146 --> 00:03:19.106 A:middle
in your block right now.

00:03:20.776 --> 00:03:23.456 A:middle
So let's look at a
backtrace of Thread 16.

00:03:24.816 --> 00:03:27.206 A:middle
After the debugger has
finished its unwinding,

00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:32.116 A:middle
the bottommost frame, Frame
9, represents the start

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:34.486 A:middle
of the worker thread,
which corresponds

00:03:34.486 --> 00:03:36.236 A:middle
to the dequeuing event.

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:38.166 A:middle
So what do you have to do

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:41.166 A:middle
to understand the control flow
before the enqueuing event?

00:03:42.306 --> 00:03:45.636 A:middle
Well, what I used to do
is to find the method

00:03:45.636 --> 00:03:47.596 A:middle
that contains the
enqueuing event,

00:03:47.676 --> 00:03:49.246 A:middle
in this case cachedGraphImage,

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:51.356 A:middle
paste it in the Search
Navigator,

00:03:52.056 --> 00:03:55.376 A:middle
search for all the call sites
of it, put break points there,

00:03:56.156 --> 00:03:57.646 A:middle
re-launch the application,

00:03:58.106 --> 00:04:00.006 A:middle
go through all the
crazy UI gestures


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.106 --> 00:04:00.006 A:middle
go through all the
crazy UI gestures

00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:02.336 A:middle
to make sure I can
repeat the similar --

00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:05.336 A:middle
the same problem to
hit the break point.

00:04:07.186 --> 00:04:10.946 A:middle
And heaven forbids if
those call sites are also

00:04:10.946 --> 00:04:13.676 A:middle
in another dispatch async
because that means I have

00:04:13.676 --> 00:04:16.185 A:middle
to wash, rinse, and repeat.

00:04:16.896 --> 00:04:20.196 A:middle
But, Xcode is not lying to you

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:23.136 A:middle
when it's giving you
this limited backtrace.

00:04:24.086 --> 00:04:25.186 A:middle
That's because the thread

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:29.806 A:middle
that does enqueuing did it
asynchronously in the past.

00:04:31.316 --> 00:04:34.446 A:middle
In fact, that thread is possibly
doing something completely

00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:36.926 A:middle
different or may be
gone from memory.

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:41.816 A:middle
So it's not fair to accuse
a debugger of not being able

00:04:41.816 --> 00:04:45.866 A:middle
to unwind to the past, but in
your head, you must be thinking,

00:04:45.866 --> 00:04:46.886 A:middle
"Well, this is accurate

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:50.306 A:middle
but surely Xcode can present
a more logical backtrace."

00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:54.236 A:middle
And we agree with you.

00:04:54.456 --> 00:05:00.026 A:middle
So in the scenario that I
described above, over here,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:54.456 --> 00:05:00.026 A:middle
So in the scenario that I
described above, over here,

00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:03.626 A:middle
we're going to splice and
Xcode 6 is going to splice

00:05:03.626 --> 00:05:06.306 A:middle
in the backtrace of
the enqueuing event

00:05:07.546 --> 00:05:08.836 A:middle
so that it can show them to you

00:05:08.836 --> 00:05:11.656 A:middle
in a more logical
manner in the UI.

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:16.466 A:middle
And if you have one in --
more than one enqueuing event,

00:05:16.736 --> 00:05:18.316 A:middle
Xcode is going to
follow the chain

00:05:18.936 --> 00:05:19.946 A:middle
so that it shows you everything.

00:05:24.196 --> 00:05:26.006 A:middle
So how did we do that?

00:05:26.046 --> 00:05:28.226 A:middle
Well we worked through
several layers of the OS,

00:05:28.686 --> 00:05:33.136 A:middle
down to the core OS, we
shortcuts all the backtraces

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:36.506 A:middle
of the enqueuing event, so
when your application hits a

00:05:36.506 --> 00:05:38.866 A:middle
breakpoint, Xcode
will ask the debugger

00:05:39.496 --> 00:05:40.656 A:middle
to retrieve the backtrace,

00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:44.786 A:middle
so that we can show
them to you in the UI.

00:05:44.946 --> 00:05:47.246 A:middle
The live stack frames,
they have colored icons.

00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:51.626 A:middle
The recorded stack frames,
they have gray icons.

00:05:52.246 --> 00:05:57.536 A:middle
But, just like the live stack
frame, you can select it

00:05:57.536 --> 00:05:59.826 A:middle
and if Xcode has
its debug symbols,

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:04.016 A:middle
it will show you the source
code, like in this case.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:04.016 A:middle
it will show you the source
code, like in this case.

00:06:04.576 --> 00:06:07.806 A:middle
If it doesn't have debug symbol,
it will show this assembly

00:06:08.306 --> 00:06:10.366 A:middle
that some among us
can actually decipher.

00:06:15.046 --> 00:06:16.616 A:middle
So why are the icons gray?

00:06:17.636 --> 00:06:19.836 A:middle
Well a recorded stack
frame's icon is gray

00:06:19.836 --> 00:06:22.176 A:middle
because it is a visual cue

00:06:22.666 --> 00:06:25.276 A:middle
to let you know that
it's historical.

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:28.586 A:middle
And because it doesn't
exist in memory anymore,

00:06:29.106 --> 00:06:31.966 A:middle
you cannot interact
with it in the console.

00:06:31.966 --> 00:06:33.496 A:middle
You cannot run expressions
like [inaudible].

00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:37.806 A:middle
And Xcode will not show
you its frame variables

00:06:37.806 --> 00:06:40.826 A:middle
because recording the frame
variables would cause the

00:06:40.826 --> 00:06:45.156 A:middle
application to blow up the
memory, possibly causing it

00:06:45.156 --> 00:06:48.286 A:middle
to be jettisoned on a device.

00:06:48.696 --> 00:06:51.346 A:middle
So that wraps up the first
part of Queue Debugging.

00:06:52.256 --> 00:06:54.366 A:middle
Moving onto the second part.

00:06:55.276 --> 00:07:00.106 A:middle
Xcode by default shows you the
backtraces in the threads view


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:55.276 --> 00:07:00.106 A:middle
Xcode by default shows you the
backtraces in the threads view

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:01.196 A:middle
in the debug navigator.

00:07:01.886 --> 00:07:03.246 A:middle
As you can see here,
Threads 5 --

00:07:03.896 --> 00:07:06.306 A:middle
Thread 5 is showing
you its backtrace.

00:07:07.116 --> 00:07:09.796 A:middle
So that just means that
a backtrace is organized

00:07:09.856 --> 00:07:10.976 A:middle
by its parent threads.

00:07:12.576 --> 00:07:14.666 A:middle
There's another equally
interesting view known

00:07:14.666 --> 00:07:16.916 A:middle
as Queue's View in
the debug navigator.

00:07:16.966 --> 00:07:19.646 A:middle
And if you pay attention
to your top right corner,

00:07:19.646 --> 00:07:20.846 A:middle
there's a little control known

00:07:20.846 --> 00:07:25.296 A:middle
as the Process View
Option Selector.

00:07:26.026 --> 00:07:27.686 A:middle
It is a mouthful,
but it is useful.

00:07:29.056 --> 00:07:34.446 A:middle
So if you toggle it to the
Queue's View, Xcode switches you

00:07:34.526 --> 00:07:37.086 A:middle
over to emphasize
the relationship

00:07:37.086 --> 00:07:39.146 A:middle
between blocks and queues.

00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:43.416 A:middle
So in this slide here, you see

00:07:43.416 --> 00:07:45.586 A:middle
that the top queue has
one Executing Block.

00:07:46.306 --> 00:07:50.706 A:middle
So what about the blocks
that here you have enqueued

00:07:50.806 --> 00:07:51.906 A:middle
but not executing yet?

00:07:53.166 --> 00:07:54.156 A:middle
Let's look at this scenario.

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:58.236 A:middle
So I'm using a Serial
Queue as an illustration,

00:07:58.236 --> 00:08:00.696 A:middle
but this happens with
concurrent queues as well.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:58.236 --> 00:08:00.696 A:middle
but this happens with
concurrent queues as well.

00:08:01.916 --> 00:08:05.606 A:middle
The green square is your
currently Executing Block.

00:08:06.896 --> 00:08:09.356 A:middle
As long as it has not
finished executing,

00:08:10.886 --> 00:08:14.366 A:middle
blocks that you submit
subsequently to the queue,

00:08:14.366 --> 00:08:15.786 A:middle
will get stacked up behind it.

00:08:16.426 --> 00:08:18.646 A:middle
We call those gray
squares the Pending Blocks.

00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:22.126 A:middle
So in Xcode 6, we're going

00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:26.766 A:middle
to show you the Pending
Blocks as well of a queue.

00:08:27.516 --> 00:08:30.926 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:08:31.426 --> 00:08:33.645 A:middle
So in this case, we
have 9 Pending Blocks.

00:08:35.196 --> 00:08:38.556 A:middle
The Pending Blocks are like
Executing Block in that

00:08:38.556 --> 00:08:42.326 A:middle
if you twist it down,
it will show you the --

00:08:42.775 --> 00:08:45.766 A:middle
a backtrace which by definition,
is a recorded backtrace

00:08:45.766 --> 00:08:46.776 A:middle
of the enqueuing event.

00:08:48.146 --> 00:08:50.336 A:middle
So we hope that by
surfacing this information,

00:08:50.336 --> 00:08:52.096 A:middle
you can answer questions like,

00:08:53.036 --> 00:08:55.926 A:middle
"How many Pending Blocks have
I submitted to the queue?

00:08:56.256 --> 00:08:58.036 A:middle
Am I'm oversaturating
the queue?"

00:08:59.256 --> 00:09:01.836 A:middle
And if you have literally
tens and thousands of blocks -


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.256 --> 00:09:01.836 A:middle
And if you have literally
tens and thousands of blocks -

00:09:01.836 --> 00:09:06.616 A:middle
Pending Blocks - are there
some that are not needed,

00:09:07.766 --> 00:09:10.876 A:middle
because you may be able
to change your algorithm

00:09:10.876 --> 00:09:13.756 A:middle
or your granularity so
that you do less work?

00:09:14.656 --> 00:09:16.006 A:middle
Now doing less work is important

00:09:16.006 --> 00:09:18.116 A:middle
because that would mean
saving battery life

00:09:18.116 --> 00:09:19.396 A:middle
on your customers' devices.

00:09:19.396 --> 00:09:25.156 A:middle
So on top of that, it
will help us solve a class

00:09:25.156 --> 00:09:27.326 A:middle
of programming problems
that I'm going to go

00:09:27.326 --> 00:09:28.336 A:middle
into a demonstration now.

00:09:29.426 --> 00:09:33.406 A:middle
So, running on the simulator
is an application called Jogr

00:09:33.626 --> 00:09:37.106 A:middle
which helps you track
your runs in San Francisco

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:40.976 A:middle
and keep fit while you're
at -- during this WWDC.

00:09:41.036 --> 00:09:43.716 A:middle
Well, I know, developers jogging

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:46.156 A:middle
and keeping fit, but
we can all dream.

00:09:48.136 --> 00:09:51.386 A:middle
Now, I have a timer here
that tracks your time

00:09:51.386 --> 00:09:56.486 A:middle
and your velocity,
and a map of all

00:09:56.486 --> 00:09:58.826 A:middle
of the routes that I've done.

00:09:58.826 --> 00:10:01.106 A:middle
And I've done exactly
one this year,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:09:58.826 --> 00:10:01.106 A:middle
And I've done exactly
one this year,

00:10:01.956 --> 00:10:03.256 A:middle
which is one too many for me.

00:10:04.966 --> 00:10:08.096 A:middle
If you click on the date, if you
select the date, it will slide

00:10:08.096 --> 00:10:10.926 A:middle
in the detail page
of my velocity graph.

00:10:11.836 --> 00:10:16.576 A:middle
So notice that it takes a
little bit of time to slide

00:10:16.576 --> 00:10:19.496 A:middle
in the detail page, and I'm
sure you have learned from Apple

00:10:19.496 --> 00:10:22.506 A:middle
and your customers that
they want your animation

00:10:22.506 --> 00:10:25.556 A:middle
to be smooth: smooth
like butter.

00:10:26.326 --> 00:10:27.016 A:middle
So this is not.

00:10:29.566 --> 00:10:31.636 A:middle
And I want to figure out why.

00:10:32.366 --> 00:10:34.656 A:middle
So things I know to code
pretty well, I'm just going

00:10:34.656 --> 00:10:37.986 A:middle
to jump straight into Xcode
to the class known GraphView.

00:10:39.446 --> 00:10:41.246 A:middle
GraphView is the class
that draws the graph.

00:10:42.546 --> 00:10:45.896 A:middle
And I'm going to jump
straight awakeFromNib by going

00:10:45.896 --> 00:10:48.186 A:middle
to the implementation field
of the [inaudible] bar

00:10:48.186 --> 00:10:49.166 A:middle
and start typing "awake."

00:10:49.956 --> 00:10:52.246 A:middle
There I go.

00:10:52.486 --> 00:10:55.446 A:middle
And I've a method here that
creates my velocity path.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:59.206 A:middle
And I know that it is doing
a lot of heavy-duty work,

00:10:59.616 --> 00:11:01.816 A:middle
so let's jump into
the definition


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:59.616 --> 00:11:01.816 A:middle
so let's jump into
the definition

00:11:01.816 --> 00:11:03.106 A:middle
by doing a Command-Click on it.

00:11:04.486 --> 00:11:06.006 A:middle
What I see here is,

00:11:06.256 --> 00:11:09.016 A:middle
it's spending time fetching the
velocity data from the database,

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:14.746 A:middle
and then it takes a
lock to protect it.

00:11:15.006 --> 00:11:18.096 A:middle
And subsequently go
through each data point

00:11:18.096 --> 00:11:20.476 A:middle
in the velocity data
to draw the path.

00:11:21.246 --> 00:11:23.336 A:middle
And when it's done,
it releases the lock.

00:11:23.336 --> 00:11:27.416 A:middle
So it's doing all this
work on the main thread.

00:11:27.416 --> 00:11:29.726 A:middle
So it's impeding the
detail page from sliding in.

00:11:30.946 --> 00:11:32.676 A:middle
And this looks like
a good candidate

00:11:32.676 --> 00:11:34.526 A:middle
to use this dispatch async.

00:11:35.516 --> 00:11:37.426 A:middle
So let's do that.

00:11:38.296 --> 00:11:39.466 A:middle
Going back to awakeFromNib.

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:42.896 A:middle
And I'm going to paste --

00:11:43.086 --> 00:11:46.976 A:middle
pasting a chunk of code which
I don't have, but it's alright.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:06.046 --> 00:12:09.576 A:middle
Alright, I'm going to move
the line that creates the path

00:12:09.966 --> 00:12:11.786 A:middle
into the dispatch async block.

00:12:12.216 --> 00:12:14.456 A:middle
And I'm going to
dispatch the block

00:12:14.456 --> 00:12:16.426 A:middle
to a simple queue of the graph.

00:12:17.706 --> 00:12:20.896 A:middle
And when I'm done calculating
the path, I will update it

00:12:20.896 --> 00:12:22.476 A:middle
on the main thread like usual.

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:25.276 A:middle
So this is a pretty
simple change.

00:12:25.826 --> 00:12:33.236 A:middle
Let's rerun by clicking on the
Run button to see if it works.

00:12:35.056 --> 00:12:40.306 A:middle
Okay, I'm going to go to the
date so that I can select it.

00:12:40.776 --> 00:12:45.016 A:middle
So this time when
I select the date,

00:12:45.436 --> 00:12:52.296 A:middle
the detail page should slide
in very quickly, which it does,

00:12:53.616 --> 00:12:55.036 A:middle
but my graph is not drawing.

00:12:55.796 --> 00:12:59.346 A:middle
So, there are many ways to --

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:02.476 A:middle
you can try to figure out
what is the problem but one


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:02.476 A:middle
you can try to figure out
what is the problem but one

00:13:02.476 --> 00:13:05.346 A:middle
of my favorite way is to look
at the state of the application.

00:13:05.346 --> 00:13:08.516 A:middle
And to do that, I will
look at the backtraces

00:13:08.766 --> 00:13:13.826 A:middle
of the application by
clicking the Pause button

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:14.796 A:middle
in the debug bar.

00:13:15.576 --> 00:13:20.996 A:middle
And I know that work
for my graph is done

00:13:20.996 --> 00:13:22.146 A:middle
on the Graph Serial Queue,

00:13:22.506 --> 00:13:24.806 A:middle
so I found a thread
which is Thread 22.

00:13:25.456 --> 00:13:32.116 A:middle
I'm going to twist it
open and you see --

00:13:32.116 --> 00:13:36.586 A:middle
you may not be able to see at
the back, but Frame 2 shows

00:13:36.586 --> 00:13:38.546 A:middle
that I'm trying to
wait for a lock.

00:13:39.576 --> 00:13:40.246 A:middle
It looks like it.

00:13:40.306 --> 00:13:43.806 A:middle
I'm going to select
Frame 3 to confirm it.

00:13:43.806 --> 00:13:45.626 A:middle
And indeed, I'm waiting
for the lock.

00:13:45.906 --> 00:13:49.686 A:middle
So those of us who have faced
this situation before have a

00:13:49.686 --> 00:13:52.936 A:middle
pretty standard following
path [inaudible] which is

00:13:52.936 --> 00:13:55.406 A:middle
to find a thread
that has the lock.

00:13:56.076 --> 00:13:57.446 A:middle
So let's do that.

00:13:57.446 --> 00:14:01.116 A:middle
I'm going to show you a nifty
way to show all the backtraces


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:57.446 --> 00:14:01.116 A:middle
I'm going to show you a nifty
way to show all the backtraces

00:14:01.516 --> 00:14:06.926 A:middle
which is to first collapse the
process item and by holding

00:14:06.926 --> 00:14:09.296 A:middle
down the Option key,
you can twist it open.

00:14:09.926 --> 00:14:13.466 A:middle
So now I'm going to visually
just scan through to look

00:14:13.466 --> 00:14:15.706 A:middle
for the thread that
has the lock.

00:14:15.706 --> 00:14:22.326 A:middle
Well this is interesting
because besides the Thread 22,

00:14:22.326 --> 00:14:24.226 A:middle
which is trying to
acquire the lock,

00:14:24.226 --> 00:14:27.276 A:middle
I cannot find a thread
that has the lock.

00:14:28.126 --> 00:14:29.326 A:middle
So this is a head scratcher.

00:14:29.496 --> 00:14:31.296 A:middle
But what do you know?

00:14:31.296 --> 00:14:34.016 A:middle
We just learned something
that may be able to help us.

00:14:34.016 --> 00:14:37.276 A:middle
So I'm going to switch over
to Queue Debugging by going

00:14:37.276 --> 00:14:39.146 A:middle
to the [inaudible] control.

00:14:39.826 --> 00:14:45.646 A:middle
And here I'm going to use
the filter bar to focus

00:14:45.646 --> 00:14:47.666 A:middle
on my Graph Serial Queue.

00:14:48.306 --> 00:14:50.806 A:middle
So there it is.

00:14:52.086 --> 00:14:57.116 A:middle
So, it says here, I have one
running block which is my --

00:14:57.236 --> 00:14:59.496 A:middle
the block waiting for the lock.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:00.056 --> 00:15:02.896 A:middle
And I have one Pending Block.

00:15:03.136 --> 00:15:04.876 A:middle
To show my Pending
Block, I'm going to go

00:15:04.876 --> 00:15:08.056 A:middle
to my Debug menu
item, Debug Workflow,

00:15:08.226 --> 00:15:11.396 A:middle
and turn on Always Show
Pending Blocks and Queues.

00:15:11.956 --> 00:15:14.876 A:middle
Out pops my Pending Block.

00:15:14.876 --> 00:15:18.516 A:middle
I'm going to twist it open
and select the first frame

00:15:18.956 --> 00:15:19.956 A:middle
which has my source code.

00:15:20.486 --> 00:15:24.716 A:middle
So plotAccelerationGraph --

00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:27.596 A:middle
Curve, is a method which I
enhanced this morning as well,

00:15:28.076 --> 00:15:32.286 A:middle
to use dispatch async so that
I can work off the main thread.

00:15:32.886 --> 00:15:35.816 A:middle
And it looks like in
my haste what I did is,

00:15:35.816 --> 00:15:39.396 A:middle
I acquired a lock before
I did the dispatch async.

00:15:40.006 --> 00:15:43.416 A:middle
So what's going on is this.

00:15:43.586 --> 00:15:48.056 A:middle
I have an Execution
Block waiting for a lock,

00:15:48.596 --> 00:15:51.396 A:middle
and stacked right after
it, is my Pending Block,

00:15:52.406 --> 00:15:54.326 A:middle
which unfortunately
has the lock.

00:15:54.566 --> 00:15:58.096 A:middle
So the Pending Block cannot
move because it has to wait

00:15:58.096 --> 00:15:59.566 A:middle
for the Execution
Block to finish.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:05.626 A:middle
So this is a kind of deadlock,
albeit in a non-classical way.

00:16:06.306 --> 00:16:10.186 A:middle
So thankfully the
solution is pretty simple.

00:16:10.346 --> 00:16:12.516 A:middle
I just have to move the
line that does the locking,

00:16:13.516 --> 00:16:18.236 A:middle
closer to the place, where
it's protecting its data,

00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:20.106 A:middle
which is velocity data.

00:16:20.816 --> 00:16:24.876 A:middle
This insures that it
doesn't try to get a lock

00:16:24.876 --> 00:16:27.666 A:middle
until it's dequeued
and start executing.

00:16:29.106 --> 00:16:32.256 A:middle
So with this second
round of simple change,

00:16:32.946 --> 00:16:33.886 A:middle
let's see if this works.

00:16:43.046 --> 00:16:43.896 A:middle
Okay, let's get to the point

00:16:43.896 --> 00:16:45.546 A:middle
where I can select
the date again.

00:16:46.166 --> 00:16:48.916 A:middle
And voila.

00:16:48.956 --> 00:16:51.206 A:middle
Everything looks correct now.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.896 A:middle
So without this Queue Debugging,
what you would have to do -

00:16:54.896 --> 00:16:58.026 A:middle
what I would have to do - is
to search for all the places

00:16:58.026 --> 00:17:03.536 A:middle
where my velocity data lock is
used and visually look at them


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:58.026 --> 00:17:03.536 A:middle
where my velocity data lock is
used and visually look at them

00:17:03.536 --> 00:17:06.675 A:middle
and reason really hard
about how it's used.

00:17:07.286 --> 00:17:08.826 A:middle
And that's error
prone and tedious.

00:17:09.766 --> 00:17:11.726 A:middle
In summary, you're going
to get Queue Debugging

00:17:11.726 --> 00:17:14.566 A:middle
in Xcode 6, which has two parts.

00:17:15.195 --> 00:17:16.986 A:middle
Recorded backtrace is
going to get you --

00:17:17.256 --> 00:17:20.346 A:middle
show you backtrace of
the enqueuing event

00:17:20.346 --> 00:17:24.476 A:middle
when you're using dispatch
async and Pending Blocks, by --

00:17:24.846 --> 00:17:27.016 A:middle
hopefully by surfacing
this information,

00:17:27.016 --> 00:17:29.866 A:middle
you can optimize
your use of GCD.

00:17:30.756 --> 00:17:33.146 A:middle
With that, let me bring up Troy
to talk about view debugging.

00:17:34.516 --> 00:17:40.886 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:41.386 --> 00:17:42.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Troy.

00:17:42.626 --> 00:17:46.566 A:middle
And thank you for coming to
our Debugging in Xcode 6.

00:17:47.116 --> 00:17:49.876 A:middle
As you may know, Xcode
is a fantastic tool

00:17:50.396 --> 00:17:52.426 A:middle
for discovering things
about your application

00:17:52.816 --> 00:17:54.086 A:middle
that may be hidden
through the debugger.

00:17:55.296 --> 00:17:57.566 A:middle
Han Ming just showed
us two new features

00:17:57.696 --> 00:18:00.746 A:middle
through the Pending Blocks
and recorded stack traces


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:57.696 --> 00:18:00.746 A:middle
through the Pending Blocks
and recorded stack traces

00:18:01.406 --> 00:18:04.086 A:middle
that are hidden pieces
of information

00:18:04.086 --> 00:18:06.716 A:middle
about your application
that Xcode exposes to you.

00:18:07.826 --> 00:18:10.086 A:middle
But we all know that
not all of the bugs

00:18:10.086 --> 00:18:11.436 A:middle
in our applications are hidden.

00:18:11.856 --> 00:18:13.386 A:middle
Some of them are
extremely visible.

00:18:13.386 --> 00:18:14.626 A:middle
They're staring us
right in the face,

00:18:15.016 --> 00:18:16.686 A:middle
from the user interface
of our applications.

00:18:16.686 --> 00:18:20.476 A:middle
And since these are visual
bugs, wouldn't it be great

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:22.816 A:middle
if we could debug
them visually as well?

00:18:23.916 --> 00:18:25.406 A:middle
And now in Xcode 6, you can.

00:18:26.316 --> 00:18:28.046 A:middle
So what kind of bugs
am I talking about?

00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:31.226 A:middle
These are the bugs where you
have a mis-positioned view

00:18:31.226 --> 00:18:32.626 A:middle
or clipping is wrong.

00:18:33.496 --> 00:18:35.546 A:middle
These are the squished
or the stretched views.

00:18:35.626 --> 00:18:37.816 A:middle
And these are the views
that are missing entirely

00:18:37.816 --> 00:18:38.846 A:middle
because the visibility

00:18:38.846 --> 00:18:42.206 A:middle
or "is hidden" attribute is set
incorrectly in your application.

00:18:43.986 --> 00:18:48.676 A:middle
But that's not all
that this new aspect

00:18:48.676 --> 00:18:50.126 A:middle
of the debugger in
Xcode helps with.

00:18:50.906 --> 00:18:52.166 A:middle
You can use it when
you're not even debugging.

00:18:52.306 --> 00:18:53.736 A:middle
Let's say I have an
application like this,

00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:59.676 A:middle
and I would like to add
a new button down here.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:00.646 --> 00:19:04.476 A:middle
And I don't know, maybe
it's a new code base to me,

00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:06.106 A:middle
maybe it's been awhile
since I've read this,

00:19:06.106 --> 00:19:08.426 A:middle
I don't know what this
view is behind it.

00:19:08.786 --> 00:19:13.406 A:middle
Wouldn't it be great if I
could just click with the mouse

00:19:13.406 --> 00:19:14.486 A:middle
and find out what that view is?

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:15.876 A:middle
Well now, you can.

00:19:16.956 --> 00:19:21.236 A:middle
This view debugger feature is
integrated all throughout Xcode.

00:19:22.126 --> 00:19:24.586 A:middle
So let's take a look at
the Xcode window and figure

00:19:24.586 --> 00:19:25.986 A:middle
out where the different
pieces are

00:19:26.196 --> 00:19:28.486 A:middle
so that we know what we're
talking about when we're talking

00:19:28.716 --> 00:19:30.546 A:middle
about this view debugging
feature.

00:19:31.316 --> 00:19:33.256 A:middle
Here is the Xcode window
that we all know and love.

00:19:34.286 --> 00:19:35.766 A:middle
When your application
is running,

00:19:35.766 --> 00:19:37.566 A:middle
down at the bottom
there's the Debug Bar.

00:19:37.566 --> 00:19:40.276 A:middle
This is where you find
your familiar items

00:19:40.276 --> 00:19:42.296 A:middle
such as the Pause
and Continue buttons.

00:19:42.656 --> 00:19:44.156 A:middle
Well now there's a
new button in there,

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:47.746 A:middle
which is the Debug View
Hierarchy button, right here.

00:19:48.176 --> 00:19:50.766 A:middle
Simply click this,
and Xcode is going

00:19:50.766 --> 00:19:53.916 A:middle
to import the user
interface of your application

00:19:53.916 --> 00:19:56.386 A:middle
into the main editor
window of Xcode.

00:19:57.016 --> 00:20:01.436 A:middle
But it's not just imported as
a static image, it's imported


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:57.016 --> 00:20:01.436 A:middle
But it's not just imported as
a static image, it's imported

00:20:01.436 --> 00:20:05.546 A:middle
as separate pieces so that
Xcode can actually explode it

00:20:05.546 --> 00:20:10.976 A:middle
out into three dimensions and
rotate it around if you want.

00:20:11.046 --> 00:20:14.206 A:middle
Seeing your application in this
3D view is very illuminating.

00:20:14.206 --> 00:20:17.406 A:middle
It allows you to
traverse the hierarchy,

00:20:17.406 --> 00:20:19.606 A:middle
see what the parent views are,
see where the siblings are.

00:20:19.606 --> 00:20:22.146 A:middle
But if you want a more
concrete representation

00:20:22.216 --> 00:20:25.946 A:middle
of your view hierarchy, we
turn to the Debug Navigator.

00:20:26.956 --> 00:20:28.866 A:middle
This is as Han Ming
talked about,

00:20:28.866 --> 00:20:30.616 A:middle
the place where you find
your threads and your queues.

00:20:31.626 --> 00:20:33.616 A:middle
And that's available here

00:20:33.616 --> 00:20:36.096 A:middle
in this Process View
Option Selector.

00:20:36.746 --> 00:20:40.916 A:middle
If you select the View option
in there, now there's threads,

00:20:40.916 --> 00:20:44.396 A:middle
queues, and views, down below
we have, your view hierarchy

00:20:44.746 --> 00:20:52.106 A:middle
in the application
which is right here.

00:20:52.276 --> 00:20:53.816 A:middle
Down below, we have
some filtering options

00:20:53.816 --> 00:20:55.546 A:middle
to help you tame that list.

00:20:56.286 --> 00:20:58.056 A:middle
We have the Show
Only Primary Views

00:20:58.056 --> 00:20:59.736 A:middle
and we have a Show
Only Displayed Views.

00:20:59.736 --> 00:21:02.626 A:middle
Let me stop on this second one,
because this one's important.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.736 --> 00:21:02.626 A:middle
Let me stop on this second one,
because this one's important.

00:21:02.626 --> 00:21:04.736 A:middle
If you have a view that's
missing in your application,

00:21:05.396 --> 00:21:08.486 A:middle
and maybe the "is
hidden" is set on it.

00:21:08.736 --> 00:21:11.476 A:middle
And so Xcode is also going
to hide it in the Xcode UI,

00:21:12.016 --> 00:21:14.006 A:middle
but Xcode knows about it.

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:15.236 A:middle
It could show it to you.

00:21:15.286 --> 00:21:19.266 A:middle
So, you can simply turn off this
option and Xcode will show all

00:21:19.266 --> 00:21:21.016 A:middle
of your views, even the
ones that are hidden.

00:21:22.326 --> 00:21:25.566 A:middle
Finally, there's the string
comparison there, which we'll do

00:21:25.566 --> 00:21:28.556 A:middle
in an exact match of that
list in the navigator

00:21:28.556 --> 00:21:31.556 A:middle
to help you drill down to
exactly the item you're

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:31.976 A:middle
looking for.

00:21:33.096 --> 00:21:34.366 A:middle
Now let's turn our attention

00:21:34.366 --> 00:21:37.026 A:middle
over to the right hand
side of the Xcode window.

00:21:37.316 --> 00:21:38.966 A:middle
This is the Inspector Area.

00:21:39.086 --> 00:21:40.366 A:middle
And you might be
familiar with this

00:21:40.366 --> 00:21:41.816 A:middle
if you've ever used
an interface builder,

00:21:41.816 --> 00:21:42.936 A:middle
because these are very similar.

00:21:43.616 --> 00:21:45.126 A:middle
We have an object inspector,

00:21:45.436 --> 00:21:46.986 A:middle
and there's a size
inspector as well.

00:21:47.966 --> 00:21:51.016 A:middle
Here we see the object
inspector for a UI image view.

00:21:52.336 --> 00:21:54.616 A:middle
And not only that, this is
a specific UI image view

00:21:55.016 --> 00:21:58.336 A:middle
because we're selecting --
we're clicking on one that's

00:21:58.506 --> 00:22:00.906 A:middle
in our application, so we
actually have the address


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.506 --> 00:22:00.906 A:middle
in our application, so we
actually have the address

00:22:00.906 --> 00:22:03.676 A:middle
of that object as well,
which is Resident in Memory,

00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:05.756 A:middle
on your Mac of on
your iOS device.

00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:10.606 A:middle
We have the thumbnail and all
the other interesting attributes

00:22:10.876 --> 00:22:14.036 A:middle
about that view listed
in this Inspector.

00:22:14.686 --> 00:22:16.136 A:middle
Finally, we have
the Size Inspector.

00:22:16.136 --> 00:22:17.356 A:middle
This is going to
show you the size

00:22:17.356 --> 00:22:18.916 A:middle
and position, as
you might expect.

00:22:19.526 --> 00:22:22.916 A:middle
It's also going to show a list
of the auto-layout constraints

00:22:22.916 --> 00:22:26.706 A:middle
that are affecting that
view, with two exceptions.

00:22:26.706 --> 00:22:29.176 A:middle
Down at the bottom,
you see two constraints

00:22:29.176 --> 00:22:30.346 A:middle
which are deemphasized.

00:22:30.346 --> 00:22:33.216 A:middle
These are not affecting the
layout of your view currently,

00:22:33.456 --> 00:22:34.656 A:middle
but they're still
attached to the view

00:22:34.656 --> 00:22:36.216 A:middle
and they still have meaning.

00:22:36.376 --> 00:22:40.926 A:middle
In this case, we have
a self.width of 320,

00:22:41.416 --> 00:22:43.386 A:middle
and in the parentheses, you
see that's content size.

00:22:43.386 --> 00:22:46.876 A:middle
That's because the system added
this implicitly to this view

00:22:47.356 --> 00:22:48.806 A:middle
to represent the content size.

00:22:49.536 --> 00:22:51.696 A:middle
They're deemphasized because
up above, they're redundant

00:22:51.696 --> 00:22:54.146 A:middle
with two explicit
constraints that were added

00:22:54.146 --> 00:22:57.646 A:middle
in Interface Builder, and
those also have a width of 320,

00:22:57.646 --> 00:22:59.836 A:middle
in this case, but they
might not always match.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:00.406 --> 00:23:01.776 A:middle
So this is a great
place to check

00:23:01.776 --> 00:23:04.516 A:middle
if you think you're
having constraint issues,

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:06.406 A:middle
as we're going to see
in a demo which I'd

00:23:06.406 --> 00:23:10.006 A:middle
like to show you right now.

00:23:10.266 --> 00:23:12.116 A:middle
Alright, here we
have the application

00:23:12.256 --> 00:23:13.256 A:middle
that Han Ming started with.

00:23:14.376 --> 00:23:16.916 A:middle
And if you have super,
eagle eyes, or maybe not,

00:23:17.096 --> 00:23:20.346 A:middle
you'll notice that there's a
pretty bad visual bug down here.

00:23:20.706 --> 00:23:24.176 A:middle
I wonder if the View Debugging
in Xcode can help us find that.

00:23:24.376 --> 00:23:27.536 A:middle
So I'm going to switch
over to Xcode,

00:23:27.766 --> 00:23:33.606 A:middle
find this Debug View Hierarchy
button, and simply press it.

00:23:33.876 --> 00:23:36.556 A:middle
What's happening now is Xcode's
going through all of the views

00:23:36.556 --> 00:23:39.876 A:middle
in the application, and pulling
them back into the Xcode window.

00:23:40.556 --> 00:23:43.176 A:middle
Now we see, the user
interface right here.

00:23:44.066 --> 00:23:46.466 A:middle
And already, you're
getting a better look

00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:48.896 A:middle
at what might be the
issue in this application.

00:23:48.896 --> 00:23:51.616 A:middle
You see, some of the
views, some of the images

00:23:51.616 --> 00:23:54.676 A:middle
in this UI collection
view, are outside the view

00:23:54.676 --> 00:23:56.096 A:middle
where they are supposed
to be contained.

00:23:56.906 --> 00:24:01.466 A:middle
That's a pretty interesting fact
to help diagnose the problem


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:23:56.906 --> 00:24:01.466 A:middle
That's a pretty interesting fact
to help diagnose the problem

00:24:01.466 --> 00:24:04.936 A:middle
but it doesn't help us solve
the problem, so we're going

00:24:04.936 --> 00:24:07.536 A:middle
to have to dig deeper.

00:24:09.196 --> 00:24:12.486 A:middle
To explode the View Hierarchy
of you application, all you need

00:24:12.486 --> 00:24:14.936 A:middle
to do is simply click and
drag anywhere in the canvas.

00:24:16.056 --> 00:24:19.666 A:middle
This allows us to see the
parent-child relationships

00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:20.646 A:middle
between some of these views.

00:24:21.556 --> 00:24:25.856 A:middle
I have open on the right
hand side, the Assist Editor

00:24:25.856 --> 00:24:27.006 A:middle
which is in Automatic Mode.

00:24:27.626 --> 00:24:33.416 A:middle
This allows Xcode to track the
file that I click over here

00:24:33.416 --> 00:24:35.186 A:middle
in the view debugger,

00:24:35.606 --> 00:24:37.936 A:middle
with a source code file
that matches with it.

00:24:38.246 --> 00:24:40.406 A:middle
So if I click here, I
get the source code file

00:24:40.406 --> 00:24:43.276 A:middle
for UI Image View.

00:24:43.276 --> 00:24:48.776 A:middle
I'm going to traverse backwards
up through the hierarchy,

00:24:48.986 --> 00:24:50.706 A:middle
until I get to the custom cell

00:24:50.706 --> 00:24:52.236 A:middle
that has been written
for this class.

00:24:53.026 --> 00:24:55.316 A:middle
The parent of this UI
Image View is a UI View,

00:24:55.486 --> 00:24:57.486 A:middle
and this is the Content
View of that cell.

00:24:57.976 --> 00:25:01.986 A:middle
And the one behind that is the
Run-Details Collection View Cell


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:57.976 --> 00:25:01.986 A:middle
And the one behind that is the
Run-Details Collection View Cell

00:25:01.986 --> 00:25:03.926 A:middle
which is custom code
in my application.

00:25:04.516 --> 00:25:09.876 A:middle
I'm also going to open up
the Inspector here and check

00:25:09.876 --> 00:25:12.086 A:middle
out some of the positions
of these views as --

00:25:12.086 --> 00:25:14.676 A:middle
because it looks like there's
probably a position bug here.

00:25:15.466 --> 00:25:20.256 A:middle
So traversing back up the stack,
starting with one of these views

00:25:20.256 --> 00:25:23.626 A:middle
that has a missing image, I'm
going to click here and see

00:25:23.626 --> 00:25:25.496 A:middle
that the position is 160 45.

00:25:26.406 --> 00:25:32.546 A:middle
Its child is 45 45, because
the position is relative

00:25:32.546 --> 00:25:36.486 A:middle
to its parent, but where
is this final view?

00:25:37.246 --> 00:25:38.556 A:middle
I'm going to go over
to the Navigator

00:25:38.836 --> 00:25:42.126 A:middle
and find the view I have
selected is this UI View,

00:25:42.436 --> 00:25:44.496 A:middle
and I can simply find
where its child is.

00:25:44.606 --> 00:25:46.706 A:middle
I don't know where it
is in spatial space,

00:25:46.736 --> 00:25:50.056 A:middle
but I know where it is in the
real hierarchy of the view.

00:25:50.316 --> 00:25:54.626 A:middle
So if I click here, I see
that the position is 160 45.

00:25:54.626 --> 00:25:56.506 A:middle
And remember, that's
based on the parent.

00:25:57.016 --> 00:26:00.236 A:middle
So what I'm actually looking
at is this view over here.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:57.016 --> 00:26:00.236 A:middle
So what I'm actually looking
at is this view over here.

00:26:00.236 --> 00:26:01.316 A:middle
I thought that was
a working one,

00:26:01.666 --> 00:26:06.816 A:middle
but the view has been shifted
off of the cell and it's --

00:26:06.946 --> 00:26:07.966 A:middle
that's the reason it's missing.

00:26:09.146 --> 00:26:14.006 A:middle
So let's go back up to the
cell class and take a look

00:26:14.006 --> 00:26:17.016 A:middle
at the implementation
of that class.

00:26:17.016 --> 00:26:19.926 A:middle
I'm going to Command Click on
the class name here to dive

00:26:19.926 --> 00:26:20.816 A:middle
into the implementation.

00:26:21.326 --> 00:26:25.596 A:middle
And here you see a fairly simple
implementation for a cell view.

00:26:26.126 --> 00:26:28.396 A:middle
All it does, is it
overrides the initWithFrame,

00:26:29.296 --> 00:26:33.046 A:middle
it creates a new UI Image View,
and then it adds it as the --

00:26:33.046 --> 00:26:36.596 A:middle
a sub view of the Content
View right down here.

00:26:37.436 --> 00:26:40.416 A:middle
Thinking about the
information we found earlier.

00:26:41.056 --> 00:26:43.746 A:middle
We know that there's a
position issue and I can see

00:26:43.746 --> 00:26:48.136 A:middle
that we're passing the frameRect
of the cell to this sub view.

00:26:48.946 --> 00:26:49.686 A:middle
That's not what I want.

00:26:49.686 --> 00:26:53.186 A:middle
I want the sub view to have
the same bounds as the cell.

00:26:53.306 --> 00:26:58.776 A:middle
So instead of frameRect, I'm
going to type self.bounds.

00:26:59.246 --> 00:27:00.576 A:middle
This should be enough
to fix our problem,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:59.246 --> 00:27:00.576 A:middle
This should be enough
to fix our problem,

00:27:00.576 --> 00:27:03.296 A:middle
so I'm going to build and run.

00:27:04.366 --> 00:27:06.186 A:middle
Switch over to the simulator.

00:27:07.176 --> 00:27:12.506 A:middle
And dive back into
our Run Details View.

00:27:14.006 --> 00:27:18.186 A:middle
Sure enough, we have the fully
functioning UI collection view

00:27:18.186 --> 00:27:21.196 A:middle
with all our images,
tightly spaced as expected.

00:27:21.906 --> 00:27:24.886 A:middle
Now that that bug's fixed,
I do see another issue.

00:27:24.886 --> 00:27:28.576 A:middle
You see, this label
up here, San Fran,

00:27:28.576 --> 00:27:30.726 A:middle
is kind of a cheeky
nickname for San Francisco,

00:27:30.726 --> 00:27:32.356 A:middle
but this is a serious
running app.

00:27:33.156 --> 00:27:36.146 A:middle
This is an app for those
of us that go every morning

00:27:36.146 --> 00:27:38.566 A:middle
and we don't call this
fair city San Fran.

00:27:38.716 --> 00:27:39.766 A:middle
This is San Francisco.

00:27:40.196 --> 00:27:43.916 A:middle
So let's go back to the
View Debugger and see

00:27:43.916 --> 00:27:45.636 A:middle
if we can understand what
might be going on there.

00:27:54.046 --> 00:27:54.976 A:middle
I'm going to take a moment

00:27:54.976 --> 00:27:58.176 A:middle
to admire the fully
functioning, UI Collection View.

00:27:58.296 --> 00:27:59.146 A:middle
Looks great.

00:27:59.716 --> 00:28:02.436 A:middle
I'm going then turn back
to two dimensional mode.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:59.716 --> 00:28:02.436 A:middle
I'm going then turn back
to two dimensional mode.

00:28:02.436 --> 00:28:05.046 A:middle
This button down here allows
us to reset the view hierarchy,

00:28:05.576 --> 00:28:07.376 A:middle
and I'm going to
click on this label.

00:28:07.926 --> 00:28:13.596 A:middle
Alright, I know that I'm using
Auto Layout in this application,

00:28:13.596 --> 00:28:16.276 A:middle
so let's go ahead and see if
there's anything having to do

00:28:16.276 --> 00:28:17.956 A:middle
with constraints that
might be an issue.

00:28:18.516 --> 00:28:22.526 A:middle
Down here is the Show
Constraints button.

00:28:22.526 --> 00:28:26.006 A:middle
This, it shows all the
constraints, and it also dims

00:28:26.006 --> 00:28:28.656 A:middle
out the views that are not
currently related to those --

00:28:28.656 --> 00:28:30.606 A:middle
to that view or its constraints.

00:28:30.826 --> 00:28:35.106 A:middle
This allows us to really
focus in on the work at hand.

00:28:36.016 --> 00:28:39.996 A:middle
When I zoom in, it's
plain to see

00:28:39.996 --> 00:28:42.326 A:middle
that there are two constraints
attached to this label.

00:28:43.166 --> 00:28:46.916 A:middle
And if I look over here,
I see the width is 95.

00:28:47.876 --> 00:28:51.756 A:middle
There's an explicit constraint
of 95, but down in the bottom,

00:28:51.756 --> 00:28:54.586 A:middle
the content size is 109.5.

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:57.796 A:middle
So clearly, somebody added
an explicit constraint

00:28:57.796 --> 00:29:01.936 A:middle
in Interface Builder and that's
clipping the implicit size


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:57.796 --> 00:29:01.936 A:middle
in Interface Builder and that's
clipping the implicit size

00:29:02.096 --> 00:29:02.946 A:middle
of that label.

00:29:03.706 --> 00:29:06.216 A:middle
So I'm just going to switch
over to my storyboard,

00:29:07.516 --> 00:29:10.286 A:middle
find that label, and delete
that explicit constraint.

00:29:10.876 --> 00:29:17.106 A:middle
If I had the time to show you
guys, I would add a constraint

00:29:17.166 --> 00:29:18.456 A:middle
that properly limited that label

00:29:18.456 --> 00:29:20.546 A:middle
so it didn't go beyond
the bounds of the screen,

00:29:20.546 --> 00:29:23.486 A:middle
but I'm sure you can find an
Interface Builder session.

00:29:23.486 --> 00:29:26.446 A:middle
For example, this afternoon
at 3:15 that will go

00:29:27.526 --> 00:29:30.166 A:middle
into more detail about how
to lay out constraints.

00:29:31.276 --> 00:29:35.576 A:middle
And then we have the full
string of that label.

00:29:36.696 --> 00:29:40.306 A:middle
So we've seen that the View
Debugger, is a fantastic way

00:29:40.646 --> 00:29:44.226 A:middle
to look -- take a look
at your application.

00:29:44.226 --> 00:29:45.466 A:middle
And I invite you
to do just that.

00:29:45.726 --> 00:29:49.816 A:middle
Go back today, just after the
session, open up your computers

00:29:49.816 --> 00:29:51.366 A:middle
and just try hitting
the View Debugger button

00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:52.356 A:middle
on your application.

00:29:52.356 --> 00:29:55.676 A:middle
I think you'll find it
illuminating and the integration

00:29:55.676 --> 00:29:57.016 A:middle
with Xcode is fantastic.

00:29:57.606 --> 00:29:59.156 A:middle
Now I'd like to turn
it over to Kerry,

00:29:59.416 --> 00:30:01.046 A:middle
who's going to teach
you a little bit more


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:29:59.416 --> 00:30:01.046 A:middle
who's going to teach
you a little bit more

00:30:01.046 --> 00:30:02.326 A:middle
about Quick Look Previews.

00:30:03.516 --> 00:30:06.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:07.066 --> 00:30:07.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Troy.

00:30:08.516 --> 00:30:09.566 A:middle
My name is Kerry.

00:30:09.806 --> 00:30:12.866 A:middle
And how is everyone enjoying
the conference so far?

00:30:13.516 --> 00:30:15.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:30:16.046 --> 00:30:16.316 A:middle
That's great.

00:30:16.316 --> 00:30:18.536 A:middle
I know that we are very
excited to be here as well,

00:30:18.836 --> 00:30:23.486 A:middle
to show some great new
debugging features in Xcode 6.

00:30:23.896 --> 00:30:26.076 A:middle
But first, let's
take a step back.

00:30:27.026 --> 00:30:31.076 A:middle
Last year, Xcode 5 debuted
with this great new feature,

00:30:31.546 --> 00:30:34.806 A:middle
whereby as you are running and
debugging your application,

00:30:35.246 --> 00:30:39.196 A:middle
you can get a live Quick
Look preview of your data.

00:30:39.886 --> 00:30:44.006 A:middle
So simply by clicking
on the Quick Look icon

00:30:44.006 --> 00:30:46.486 A:middle
in the Debug Bar, you
can get this popover

00:30:46.486 --> 00:30:47.676 A:middle
that would show you a preview.

00:30:47.966 --> 00:30:51.266 A:middle
You could even, simply by
hovering over the source

00:30:51.266 --> 00:30:53.266 A:middle
of a variable in
the Source Editor,

00:30:53.856 --> 00:30:57.326 A:middle
get a Quick Look preview right
from there, just by clicking

00:30:57.326 --> 00:31:02.306 A:middle
on the Quick Look icon in
the popover that appears.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:57.326 --> 00:31:02.306 A:middle
on the Quick Look icon in
the popover that appears.

00:31:02.546 --> 00:31:07.196 A:middle
Now, Xcode 5 debuted with
default support for a number

00:31:07.196 --> 00:31:11.126 A:middle
of important and common
object types like images

00:31:11.466 --> 00:31:15.686 A:middle
and Bezier paths and even
things like map locations.

00:31:16.646 --> 00:31:19.326 A:middle
Well, we've gotten a lot of
great feedback from this feature

00:31:19.326 --> 00:31:22.426 A:middle
and I know that it's been
very useful to a number

00:31:22.426 --> 00:31:23.896 A:middle
of developers including myself.

00:31:24.486 --> 00:31:29.826 A:middle
So to build on the success,
in Xcode 6, there is support

00:31:29.826 --> 00:31:31.826 A:middle
for two new object types.

00:31:33.116 --> 00:31:35.526 A:middle
The first is Views.

00:31:36.536 --> 00:31:39.156 A:middle
So whether it be a UI
View or an NS View,

00:31:39.886 --> 00:31:44.446 A:middle
you can get a Quick Look preview
of that, simply by clicking

00:31:44.446 --> 00:31:48.976 A:middle
in the Variables view and
clicking on the Quick Look icon

00:31:48.976 --> 00:31:51.386 A:middle
or my favorite is
just hit the Space Bar

00:31:51.456 --> 00:31:53.976 A:middle
and it will bring
up a nice preview.

00:31:54.166 --> 00:31:57.436 A:middle
And considering how common
views are in most applications,

00:31:58.066 --> 00:32:00.196 A:middle
I think this will be a
very powerful feature.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:58.066 --> 00:32:00.196 A:middle
I think this will be a
very powerful feature.

00:32:01.756 --> 00:32:06.816 A:middle
Now the second object type
that was added is, well,

00:32:06.816 --> 00:32:08.336 A:middle
I honestly don't know.

00:32:08.916 --> 00:32:11.406 A:middle
That's because it's
your own custom class.

00:32:12.656 --> 00:32:15.646 A:middle
So now for the first
time, if you have a class

00:32:16.256 --> 00:32:19.976 A:middle
that does some custom drawing
and perhaps returns a --

00:32:19.976 --> 00:32:24.356 A:middle
an image or a Bezier path
or something like that,

00:32:25.246 --> 00:32:28.026 A:middle
you can now get a
preview of that as well.

00:32:29.016 --> 00:32:32.236 A:middle
Before now, there wasn't
great support for that.

00:32:32.416 --> 00:32:34.346 A:middle
So if you were to try
and get a preview,

00:32:34.346 --> 00:32:37.126 A:middle
you would get this Default View

00:32:37.126 --> 00:32:39.766 A:middle
which had some pertinent
information like the name

00:32:39.766 --> 00:32:42.536 A:middle
and the address and the
type, but no preview.

00:32:43.556 --> 00:32:46.676 A:middle
So I would like to show
you how to fix that.

00:32:46.676 --> 00:32:51.126 A:middle
There's a simple method
that you can implement

00:32:51.336 --> 00:32:53.196 A:middle
in your Classes Implementation

00:32:53.236 --> 00:32:56.326 A:middle
and it's called
debugQuickLookObject.

00:32:57.756 --> 00:33:00.246 A:middle
Now in this class, you can
either call your drawing code


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:57.756 --> 00:33:00.246 A:middle
Now in this class, you can
either call your drawing code

00:33:00.246 --> 00:33:03.566 A:middle
or implement it in there,
but the important point is,

00:33:03.646 --> 00:33:05.896 A:middle
from this method,
you return something

00:33:05.896 --> 00:33:08.046 A:middle
that Xcode knows how to show.

00:33:08.946 --> 00:33:12.376 A:middle
So one of the default supported
types should be returned

00:33:12.376 --> 00:33:15.196 A:middle
from this method and then
you'll be good to go.

00:33:15.236 --> 00:33:19.186 A:middle
And I would like to
show you that now.

00:33:20.416 --> 00:33:22.516 A:middle
So here we have the
Jogr application

00:33:22.516 --> 00:33:24.726 A:middle
that we've been seeing
in previous demos.

00:33:25.106 --> 00:33:27.036 A:middle
And I'm going to click
the Routes button,

00:33:27.696 --> 00:33:30.196 A:middle
and we'll see Han Ming's
run from this morning,

00:33:30.836 --> 00:33:33.886 A:middle
if that's indeed the case.

00:33:35.576 --> 00:33:38.986 A:middle
Okay, so this class has a --

00:33:38.986 --> 00:33:42.456 A:middle
an object class called
RoutePathOverlay

00:33:42.936 --> 00:33:47.826 A:middle
which accesses the run data
to generate this Bezier path

00:33:47.826 --> 00:33:49.896 A:middle
that they gets overlaid
onto the map.

00:33:50.956 --> 00:33:53.206 A:middle
So let's look at that
a little further.

00:33:53.206 --> 00:33:57.086 A:middle
Well I'm going to click on the
map and I'm going to hit this --

00:33:57.216 --> 00:33:58.896 A:middle
whoa, scrolls really fast.

00:33:59.176 --> 00:34:00.596 A:middle
I'm going to hit
this break point.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.176 --> 00:34:00.596 A:middle
I'm going to hit
this break point.

00:34:01.066 --> 00:34:03.496 A:middle
And let's say I'm trying
to debug some issue here,

00:34:04.466 --> 00:34:07.226 A:middle
now down in the Variables View,
we can see we've got a number

00:34:07.226 --> 00:34:09.376 A:middle
of local variables
like this point.

00:34:09.916 --> 00:34:12.835 A:middle
And if I click on
the Quick Look icon,

00:34:12.835 --> 00:34:14.806 A:middle
I can see a preview
of the point.

00:34:15.096 --> 00:34:16.746 A:middle
This is our route path overlay.

00:34:17.436 --> 00:34:20.005 A:middle
And if I click on that, so I'm
going to hit the Space Bar,

00:34:20.005 --> 00:34:22.556 A:middle
and what it just comes up
with is just some generic

00:34:22.556 --> 00:34:25.106 A:middle
information, but we can
do better than that.

00:34:26.315 --> 00:34:27.795 A:middle
So I'm going to stop here.

00:34:28.446 --> 00:34:32.186 A:middle
I'm going to go to
our RoutePathOverlay.

00:34:32.786 --> 00:34:35.396 A:middle
And I've got the method

00:34:35.396 --> 00:34:37.835 A:middle
that I was talking about:
debugQuickLookObject.

00:34:38.025 --> 00:34:42.766 A:middle
And it's a sort of a long
title but try and remember.

00:34:43.545 --> 00:34:47.096 A:middle
Okay, and if I uncomment
that, what this method does,

00:34:47.246 --> 00:34:48.806 A:middle
it's not really important
because it's going

00:34:48.806 --> 00:34:51.596 A:middle
to be different for
every custom class,

00:34:51.676 --> 00:34:58.076 A:middle
but what it does is it accesses
each of the 364 some odd points

00:34:58.206 --> 00:35:00.776 A:middle
of map location for that run.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:58.206 --> 00:35:00.776 A:middle
of map location for that run.

00:35:01.366 --> 00:35:05.776 A:middle
And then generates a Bezier
path, scales it a little bit,

00:35:05.776 --> 00:35:08.656 A:middle
and then returns from
it, a Bezier path,

00:35:08.656 --> 00:35:11.386 A:middle
because Xcode 6 knows
how to render

00:35:11.646 --> 00:35:15.536 A:middle
or Quick Look preview
a Bezier path.

00:35:15.656 --> 00:35:18.836 A:middle
So now that we've
implemented that or enabled it,

00:35:18.836 --> 00:35:24.606 A:middle
I'm going to Run
and Debug again.

00:35:25.696 --> 00:35:31.706 A:middle
And we'll go to our routes,
and we'll click on the map.

00:35:32.266 --> 00:35:37.986 A:middle
And if all goes well, we should
see a nice detailed preview

00:35:37.986 --> 00:35:41.086 A:middle
of each of those points
of data from the start

00:35:41.116 --> 00:35:46.646 A:middle
until the ambulance picked up
Han Ming when he collapsed.

00:35:49.366 --> 00:35:52.486 A:middle
Okay. So, what have
we seen today?

00:35:52.756 --> 00:35:56.316 A:middle
We've seen Han Ming show
us how we can very easily

00:35:56.316 --> 00:36:00.716 A:middle
and more effectively
debug queues and blocks

00:35:56.316 --> 00:36:00.716 A:middle
and more effectively
debug queues and blocks

00:36:01.296 --> 00:36:02.836 A:middle
with the new Queue
Debugging feature.

00:36:03.426 --> 00:36:07.886 A:middle
And then Troy showed us
how we can more effectively

00:36:07.886 --> 00:36:12.006 A:middle
or easily explore, our
application's View Hierarchy.

00:36:12.216 --> 00:36:16.326 A:middle
I've used this very effectively
myself several times.

00:36:16.516 --> 00:36:17.376 A:middle
It's been very helpful.

00:36:17.446 --> 00:36:21.186 A:middle
And then I showed you how
to add Quick Look previews

00:36:21.466 --> 00:36:23.336 A:middle
for your own custom classes.

00:36:23.726 --> 00:36:28.186 A:middle
And remember, you can
also now preview any view.

00:36:28.616 --> 00:36:32.176 A:middle
So for more information, you
can contact our great Developer

00:36:32.176 --> 00:36:33.956 A:middle
Tools Evangelist, Dave DeLong.

00:36:34.516 --> 00:36:36.786 A:middle
I've also got a link
here to the documentation

00:36:36.786 --> 00:36:38.836 A:middle
for Quick Look previews,

00:36:38.926 --> 00:36:43.636 A:middle
which documentation will show
you a full list of exactly all

00:36:43.636 --> 00:36:46.566 A:middle
of the default supported
types in Xcode 6.

00:36:48.286 --> 00:36:50.426 A:middle
And then, don't forget
the developer forums.

00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:55.406 A:middle
There's a lot of great
debugging sessions this week,

00:36:55.536 --> 00:36:56.846 A:middle
so be sure to check them out.

00:36:57.636 --> 00:36:59.346 A:middle
Thank you very much.
