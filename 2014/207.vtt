00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:16.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Welcome, welcome to Session
207: Accessibility on OS X.

00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:18.976 A:middle
My name is Patti Hoa.

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:22.046 A:middle
I'm a software engineer on
the OS X Accessibility team.

00:00:22.716 --> 00:00:27.396 A:middle
Today my colleague Chris Dolan
and I are extremely excited

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:30.886 A:middle
to tell you about this brand
new API was have installed

00:00:30.886 --> 00:00:33.866 A:middle
for you that's designed
to make your life simpler.

00:00:34.426 --> 00:00:38.216 A:middle
But before I talk about
that, I want to just touch

00:00:38.216 --> 00:00:42.656 A:middle
up on the importance of
accessibility, and what it means

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:46.536 A:middle
for your application to
be accessible to everyone.

00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:51.876 A:middle
Then I'll show you some examples
of how to use this new API

00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:55.156 A:middle
to make some UI's accessible,

00:00:55.676 --> 00:00:58.836 A:middle
and then I'll also show you
some tools that you can use

00:00:58.836 --> 00:01:00.246 A:middle
to verify your changes.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:00:58.836 --> 00:01:00.246 A:middle
to verify your changes.

00:01:01.346 --> 00:01:04.926 A:middle
Then in the latter half of this
session, Chris will come up

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:09.066 A:middle
and give you a live demo of
making a game accessible.

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:12.906 A:middle
So, at Apple, we really care

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:17.456 A:middle
about providing the best
platform for all users to have

00:01:17.456 --> 00:01:19.826 A:middle
that great and wonderful
experience

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:22.116 A:middle
when using your application.

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:25.486 A:middle
And when I say all
users, I mean users

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:28.506 A:middle
with various ranges
of abilities.

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:33.576 A:middle
That includes those who may be
visually challenged, and may...

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:38.096 A:middle
(excuse me) ...those who
may be visually challenged

00:01:38.096 --> 00:01:41.386 A:middle
and have trouble seeing
the colors and the graphics

00:01:41.386 --> 00:01:45.716 A:middle
on the application: those who
are deaf and hard-of-hearing,

00:01:45.716 --> 00:01:48.386 A:middle
who may not be able to
hear the sound feedback

00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:53.176 A:middle
in the application; those who
may have mobility limitation,

00:01:53.436 --> 00:01:56.636 A:middle
and may not be able to use the
physical mouse or keyboard.

00:01:57.146 --> 00:02:01.296 A:middle
Well to achieve the
goal of making sure


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:01:57.146 --> 00:02:01.296 A:middle
Well to achieve the
goal of making sure

00:02:01.296 --> 00:02:03.916 A:middle
that everyone could
have equal access,

00:02:04.316 --> 00:02:08.076 A:middle
at Apple we work really
hard to provide tons

00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:11.656 A:middle
of accessibility solutions
built right into OS X,

00:02:11.656 --> 00:02:15.836 A:middle
and that includes products
such as: VoiceOver,

00:02:16.196 --> 00:02:19.816 A:middle
designed for the visually
impaired user; Switch Control,

00:02:20.146 --> 00:02:23.056 A:middle
designed for mobility impaired
users who may only be able

00:02:23.056 --> 00:02:26.236 A:middle
to use a single switch
to operate the computer;

00:02:26.936 --> 00:02:32.186 A:middle
Closed Captioning for the deaf
and hard of hearing; and tons

00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:35.786 A:middle
and tons of other great
accessibility features built

00:02:35.786 --> 00:02:36.786 A:middle
right into OS X.

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:42.066 A:middle
But all of these features
are simply tools for the user

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:43.966 A:middle
to use your application.

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:50.106 A:middle
After all, it's your application
that they're looking at, whether

00:02:50.106 --> 00:02:55.176 A:middle
or not it's to read an
article or to watch a movie.

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:59.066 A:middle
It is your application that
they're interacting with,

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:05.156 A:middle
whether it's to play a game
or to write a term paper.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:05.156 A:middle
whether it's to play a game
or to write a term paper.

00:03:05.156 --> 00:03:07.676 A:middle
It's your application
at the end of the day

00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:10.636 A:middle
that they're looking
forward to use every day.

00:03:10.636 --> 00:03:13.246 A:middle
So how do you make sure

00:03:13.246 --> 00:03:16.326 A:middle
that your application is
accessible to everyone?

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:19.686 A:middle
Well we've built a
foundation for you

00:03:19.686 --> 00:03:21.446 A:middle
to build your application.

00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:25.456 A:middle
And we have this what we
call "Accessibility API"

00:03:25.616 --> 00:03:28.276 A:middle
that you can implement to
make sure your application's

00:03:28.276 --> 00:03:29.856 A:middle
accessible to everyone.

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:33.936 A:middle
So, I want to spend the rest
of this session telling you

00:03:33.936 --> 00:03:38.176 A:middle
about this API, but the first
thing I want to tell you is

00:03:38.226 --> 00:03:40.516 A:middle
to give you the big picture

00:03:40.516 --> 00:03:43.866 A:middle
of how this Accessibility
API works in the system.

00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:46.926 A:middle
So first there's
your application,

00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:50.756 A:middle
and then we have what we
call assistive softwares,

00:03:50.756 --> 00:03:54.746 A:middle
such as VoiceOver and Switch
Control, that help users

00:03:54.966 --> 00:03:58.516 A:middle
to perceive, understand, and
interact with your application.

00:03:58.516 --> 00:04:02.626 A:middle
And that happens through a
channel, on what we call...


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:03:58.516 --> 00:04:02.626 A:middle
And that happens through a
channel, on what we call...

00:04:03.816 --> 00:04:05.986 A:middle
Accessibility API.

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:10.426 A:middle
And so, that's what I want
to talk to you about today:

00:04:10.426 --> 00:04:15.486 A:middle
it's this Accessibility API
which, for OS X Yosemite,

00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:19.466 A:middle
we created from the ground
up -- this brand new API.

00:04:19.466 --> 00:04:22.506 A:middle
I'm excited to tell
you about this.

00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:27.776 A:middle
So, when we were first designing
this API we had a few things

00:04:27.776 --> 00:04:28.256 A:middle
in mind...

00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:33.776 A:middle
Actually, just one goal,
and that is to simplify --

00:04:33.776 --> 00:04:35.736 A:middle
to make it easy for you to use.

00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:39.316 A:middle
And to show you just how
easy it is to use this API,

00:04:39.886 --> 00:04:42.236 A:middle
I'll walk you through
a few examples.

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:46.786 A:middle
So what you see on the screen
first is a window that contains,

00:04:47.356 --> 00:04:48.986 A:middle
like, a media player controller.

00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:53.236 A:middle
So what we're going to do is
focus on the UIs in the middle.

00:04:54.506 --> 00:04:58.406 A:middle
What I see here is: a rewind,
play, and forward button.

00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:00.876 A:middle
Well how did I come
to that conclusion?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:00.876 A:middle
Well how did I come
to that conclusion?

00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:05.666 A:middle
Because visually you can
see three distinct icons,

00:05:06.156 --> 00:05:09.066 A:middle
and each of those icons
represents something.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:14.456 A:middle
Well if you're not sighted, and
you depend on assistive software

00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:18.506 A:middle
like VoiceOver to help you
perceive what's on the screen...

00:05:19.616 --> 00:05:23.046 A:middle
Well, this is what a VoiceOver
user would probably see.

00:05:23.906 --> 00:05:24.966 A:middle
Just a bunch of buttons.

00:05:25.676 --> 00:05:27.096 A:middle
They wouldn't know
what to do with them.

00:05:28.246 --> 00:05:31.926 A:middle
Even worse, if you
implemented them

00:05:31.926 --> 00:05:35.776 A:middle
as custom views,
they'll see nothing.

00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:38.926 A:middle
Not terribly accessible is it?

00:05:40.456 --> 00:05:42.216 A:middle
Well today I'm going
to show you how

00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:44.016 A:middle
to make these UIs accessible.

00:05:44.826 --> 00:05:48.676 A:middle
So what we'll do first is
we'll focus on just one button

00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:50.696 A:middle
in the middle: the Play button.

00:05:52.236 --> 00:05:55.306 A:middle
If you say you're using
AppKit control you're in luck,

00:05:55.916 --> 00:05:59.236 A:middle
because you get most of
that accessibility for free.

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:05.186 A:middle
By default, AppKit
will already fill


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:05.186 A:middle
By default, AppKit
will already fill

00:06:05.186 --> 00:06:07.676 A:middle
in all the accessibility
information for that piece

00:06:07.676 --> 00:06:09.506 A:middle
of UI knowing that
it's a button.

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.366 A:middle
However, AppKit is not psychic.

00:06:11.366 --> 00:06:14.506 A:middle
It's not going to be able
to know what the function

00:06:14.506 --> 00:06:15.896 A:middle
of that button will do.

00:06:16.216 --> 00:06:19.276 A:middle
That's something only you,
the developer, will know...

00:06:19.636 --> 00:06:23.986 A:middle
and so that's where you come
in: to help label this button.

00:06:24.446 --> 00:06:26.486 A:middle
So, there's two ways
you could do it.

00:06:26.656 --> 00:06:30.096 A:middle
You could go into Xcode
Identity Inspector.

00:06:30.816 --> 00:06:33.436 A:middle
Under the Accessibility
Identity section,

00:06:33.436 --> 00:06:36.696 A:middle
you could just add a
description: "Play."

00:06:37.286 --> 00:06:40.856 A:middle
So this, you could do
that in your zip file.

00:06:41.246 --> 00:06:43.616 A:middle
Or, if you'd like to do
this programmatically,

00:06:44.086 --> 00:06:46.726 A:middle
you could simply go into
your initialization code

00:06:47.146 --> 00:06:52.306 A:middle
and in your button cells simply
set the accessibility label

00:06:52.306 --> 00:06:58.366 A:middle
property to be the localized
string that you want it to be.

00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:02.986 A:middle
And with just that alone, now
a VoiceOver user could be able


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:02.986 A:middle
And with just that alone, now
a VoiceOver user could be able

00:07:02.986 --> 00:07:04.746 A:middle
to be perceived this
as a Play button.

00:07:05.286 --> 00:07:08.756 A:middle
What makes it so easy?

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:13.516 A:middle
Well with the new API --
which is a method-based API --

00:07:13.606 --> 00:07:16.826 A:middle
we've converted all the
attributes into properties.

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:23.686 A:middle
So just like any objective-C
property, you could now get

00:07:23.686 --> 00:07:27.526 A:middle
and set the property
directly on the object itself.

00:07:27.936 --> 00:07:29.526 A:middle
So you no longer
have to subclass.

00:07:34.356 --> 00:07:37.306 A:middle
So whenever possible,
use AppKit Control.

00:07:37.816 --> 00:07:41.146 A:middle
But for any reason you can't
use AppKit Control and you have

00:07:41.146 --> 00:07:44.076 A:middle
to do your own stuff, like
creating a custom view for each

00:07:44.076 --> 00:07:46.816 A:middle
of the UIs, well in this case,

00:07:47.416 --> 00:07:49.736 A:middle
obviously VoiceOver
will not be able

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:51.116 A:middle
to see anything on the screen.

00:07:51.116 --> 00:07:53.276 A:middle
So now you're wondering, "Great,

00:07:53.836 --> 00:07:56.576 A:middle
is there a lot more
I have to do?"

00:07:56.816 --> 00:08:01.746 A:middle
Well the good thing
is: it's just as easy


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:07:56.816 --> 00:08:01.746 A:middle
Well the good thing
is: it's just as easy

00:08:01.746 --> 00:08:03.836 A:middle
if you use this brand new API.

00:08:04.146 --> 00:08:06.916 A:middle
You could continue to use
the accessibility property I

00:08:06.916 --> 00:08:07.596 A:middle
just mentioned.

00:08:07.596 --> 00:08:09.916 A:middle
I gave you an example
of tweaking one

00:08:09.916 --> 00:08:11.626 A:middle
of the properties --
the label property.

00:08:12.006 --> 00:08:13.926 A:middle
There's tons of properties
you could use.

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:15.356 A:middle
But one of the challenges

00:08:15.356 --> 00:08:17.366 A:middle
for the developers
is knowing exactly

00:08:17.366 --> 00:08:19.066 A:middle
which property you
have to implement.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:23.606 A:middle
So now we've introduced an
accessibility protocol that's

00:08:23.606 --> 00:08:25.916 A:middle
designed to take that
guesswork out of the equation.

00:08:26.056 --> 00:08:29.116 A:middle
The protocols will guide you

00:08:29.116 --> 00:08:30.906 A:middle
through that whole
implementation process

00:08:30.906 --> 00:08:33.506 A:middle
so you know exactly which
property you have to implement,

00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:36.145 A:middle
and we have protocols
that should cover most

00:08:36.145 --> 00:08:39.216 A:middle
of the commonly used
types of UIs out there.

00:08:40.285 --> 00:08:42.586 A:middle
So how do you go about
implementing this?

00:08:42.666 --> 00:08:44.686 A:middle
Well first you have
to pick a protocol.

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:48.156 A:middle
So, we have a list of
protocols you could choose from.

00:08:48.536 --> 00:08:54.596 A:middle
So you should pick one that
corresponds to the look and feel

00:08:54.596 --> 00:08:58.596 A:middle
of your UI; the way or
the function of that UI.

00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:02.066 A:middle
So in our case we have the
example I was showing you


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:02.066 A:middle
So in our case we have the
example I was showing you

00:09:02.156 --> 00:09:03.366 A:middle
earlier with the Play button.

00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:05.496 A:middle
It looks and behaves
like a button.

00:09:05.626 --> 00:09:07.406 A:middle
So we're going to pick
the button protocol.

00:09:07.406 --> 00:09:11.326 A:middle
So, in your interface
file simply say,

00:09:11.326 --> 00:09:14.106 A:middle
adhere to the
NSAccessibilityButton.

00:09:14.966 --> 00:09:18.606 A:middle
So now you add that;
you compile.

00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:19.906 A:middle
The good thing is,

00:09:19.906 --> 00:09:22.246 A:middle
now accessibility compiler
[1]will tell you...

00:09:23.386 --> 00:09:24.366 A:middle
will give you some warning

00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:26.166 A:middle
and tell you what you
need to implement.

00:09:26.626 --> 00:09:28.126 A:middle
So in this case, you have

00:09:28.126 --> 00:09:31.156 A:middle
to implement the
accessibilityPerformPress

00:09:31.676 --> 00:09:34.146 A:middle
and accessibilityLabel methods.

00:09:34.416 --> 00:09:37.906 A:middle
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:09:38.086 --> 00:09:41.586 A:middle
So in your implementation
file, simply --

00:09:41.586 --> 00:09:44.266 A:middle
for the accessibilityLabel
method --

00:09:44.606 --> 00:09:47.546 A:middle
just return a localized
string of the word "play".

00:09:49.196 --> 00:09:51.686 A:middle
For the
accessibilityPerformPress,

00:09:51.816 --> 00:09:57.886 A:middle
we simply need to perform the
action of pressing that button.

00:09:58.496 --> 00:09:59.906 A:middle
So what's next?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:01.616 A:middle
There is no next step.

00:10:02.196 --> 00:10:03.086 A:middle
That's all.

00:10:03.086 --> 00:10:05.176 A:middle
That's just how easy it is

00:10:05.176 --> 00:10:08.316 A:middle
to implement accessibility
even for a custom view.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:13.216 A:middle
So what makes it so easy?

00:10:14.066 --> 00:10:17.066 A:middle
Well it's because AppKit's doing
a lot of work on your behalf.

00:10:17.856 --> 00:10:21.886 A:middle
By simply using this
protocol, AppKit will infer

00:10:21.886 --> 00:10:24.916 A:middle
that these elements are
accessibility elements.

00:10:25.196 --> 00:10:27.856 A:middle
And depending on which
protocol you use,

00:10:28.756 --> 00:10:31.716 A:middle
AppKit will auto-populate
information

00:10:31.716 --> 00:10:32.796 A:middle
like what the role is.

00:10:32.986 --> 00:10:36.846 A:middle
So if, for example, if I use the
NSAccessibility button protocol,

00:10:37.106 --> 00:10:38.616 A:middle
AppKit will automatically infer

00:10:38.616 --> 00:10:43.956 A:middle
that the role for
this is "button."

00:10:44.106 --> 00:10:47.556 A:middle
So as you can see how easy it
is to use, I also want to kind

00:10:47.556 --> 00:10:49.936 A:middle
of give you a little bit more
detail about these protocols.

00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:53.596 A:middle
First of all there's
the base protocol,

00:10:54.246 --> 00:10:57.386 A:middle
which is what we call the
NSAccessibilityElement protocol.

00:10:57.976 --> 00:11:00.776 A:middle
It has a few required
methods like the frame


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:10:57.976 --> 00:11:00.776 A:middle
It has a few required
methods like the frame

00:11:00.776 --> 00:11:02.176 A:middle
and the accessibility parent.

00:11:02.606 --> 00:11:04.086 A:middle
Those are basic information

00:11:04.086 --> 00:11:06.576 A:middle
that all accessibility
elements should have.

00:11:07.116 --> 00:11:09.806 A:middle
And then you build
on top of that.

00:11:09.806 --> 00:11:11.476 A:middle
We have all the other protocols,

00:11:12.076 --> 00:11:14.116 A:middle
like the button protocol
I just talked about,

00:11:14.576 --> 00:11:17.396 A:middle
which has two required
methods, the accessibilityLabel

00:11:17.446 --> 00:11:19.276 A:middle
and the
accessibilityPerformPress.

00:11:19.706 --> 00:11:21.456 A:middle
And as you saw earlier,

00:11:21.736 --> 00:11:25.356 A:middle
Xcode compiler already warned
us about those methods.

00:11:31.046 --> 00:11:34.396 A:middle
So that's just how easy it is
to implement a custom view.

00:11:35.216 --> 00:11:37.226 A:middle
By the way, the protocols
are optional.

00:11:37.426 --> 00:11:39.876 A:middle
So you don't have to
implement if you don't want to,

00:11:39.876 --> 00:11:41.946 A:middle
but it's really, really handy.

00:11:42.856 --> 00:11:46.536 A:middle
So let's go through another
example that's a little bit

00:11:46.536 --> 00:11:47.506 A:middle
more complicated.

00:11:48.716 --> 00:11:53.296 A:middle
On the screen you see six
different image shapes.

00:11:55.436 --> 00:11:58.986 A:middle
The way the developer may have
implemented is simply a custom

00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:01.466 A:middle
view where they're
doing their own drawing.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:01.466 A:middle
view where they're
doing their own drawing.

00:12:02.066 --> 00:12:07.976 A:middle
So if you have something
like this,

00:12:08.176 --> 00:12:11.116 A:middle
someone like a VoiceOver user
will still need to be able

00:12:11.116 --> 00:12:14.656 A:middle
to know that there's
six distinct UIs sitting

00:12:14.656 --> 00:12:15.186 A:middle
on the screen.

00:12:16.686 --> 00:12:21.396 A:middle
So you have to give an
accessibility representation

00:12:21.586 --> 00:12:24.766 A:middle
for each of the images that's
being displayed on the screen.

00:12:25.076 --> 00:12:30.336 A:middle
So how do you do that for UIs
that you're rendering yourself

00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:32.636 A:middle
and you don't have
an NSView backing?

00:12:33.976 --> 00:12:35.386 A:middle
Well, for those of
you who are familiar

00:12:35.386 --> 00:12:37.636 A:middle
with the old sample code,

00:12:37.636 --> 00:12:39.516 A:middle
we have something called
[inaudible] element[2].

00:12:40.246 --> 00:12:43.766 A:middle
And now with the new API we
have a formalized version

00:12:43.766 --> 00:12:46.356 A:middle
of that called
NSAccessibilityElement.

00:12:46.626 --> 00:12:50.596 A:middle
You can use this class
to support all those UIs

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:54.006 A:middle
that do not have a
backing in NSView.

00:12:54.366 --> 00:12:56.656 A:middle
So let's see how you'd go
about implementing this.

00:12:57.326 --> 00:13:00.506 A:middle
So for the example
earlier with the image --


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:12:57.326 --> 00:13:00.506 A:middle
So for the example
earlier with the image --

00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:05.766 A:middle
the six shape images -- for
each of those images you want

00:13:05.876 --> 00:13:09.036 A:middle
to create an
NSAccessibilityElement instance

00:13:09.036 --> 00:13:11.446 A:middle
for that.

00:13:12.296 --> 00:13:15.166 A:middle
So you create one of those
instances, and then you set

00:13:15.166 --> 00:13:18.156 A:middle
up some of the accessibility
properties for that,

00:13:18.196 --> 00:13:20.946 A:middle
such as who the parent
is, what the role is...

00:13:21.076 --> 00:13:22.416 A:middle
Well, in this case
we're just going

00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:23.916 A:middle
to say these are image role.

00:13:23.916 --> 00:13:26.866 A:middle
And then give it a unique label,

00:13:27.256 --> 00:13:29.566 A:middle
and then set up what
the frame is.

00:13:30.596 --> 00:13:33.316 A:middle
So when that custom view --

00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:35.396 A:middle
containing custom
view is being asked

00:13:35.396 --> 00:13:38.206 A:middle
for the accessibilityChildren,
then this is

00:13:38.206 --> 00:13:42.246 A:middle
where you return your array
of NSAccessibilityElements.

00:13:44.746 --> 00:13:47.256 A:middle
And one thing I do
want to note is:

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:51.126 A:middle
you should keep these
accessibility elements alive

00:13:51.416 --> 00:13:53.546 A:middle
as long as they are on-screen.

00:13:54.006 --> 00:13:56.046 A:middle
That's because assistive
software

00:13:56.046 --> 00:13:58.516 A:middle
like VoiceOver could be
asking for information

00:13:58.516 --> 00:14:01.506 A:middle
about these objects at any
time through IPC calls.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:13:58.516 --> 00:14:01.506 A:middle
about these objects at any
time through IPC calls.

00:14:02.256 --> 00:14:05.976 A:middle
So as long as they're on the
screen, cache them around.

00:14:10.346 --> 00:14:14.156 A:middle
Okay so that was pretty simple,
even for something like that,

00:14:14.156 --> 00:14:16.026 A:middle
where you are rendering
your own UI.

00:14:16.846 --> 00:14:19.366 A:middle
So there might be a few
of you in the audience

00:14:19.466 --> 00:14:24.066 A:middle
who may have already implemented
accessibility with the old API

00:14:24.266 --> 00:14:26.656 A:middle
in your application
and you're wondering,

00:14:26.656 --> 00:14:28.716 A:middle
"well how does this
apply to me?"

00:14:29.166 --> 00:14:31.606 A:middle
Well, if you already
added accessibility

00:14:31.606 --> 00:14:35.196 A:middle
into your application, there
is no extra work for you.

00:14:35.896 --> 00:14:39.946 A:middle
Your old API code will
continue to work just fine

00:14:40.506 --> 00:14:44.466 A:middle
because the new API is
binary and source compatible,

00:14:44.976 --> 00:14:46.076 A:middle
so you don't have to worry.

00:14:46.456 --> 00:14:49.626 A:middle
But if you do like to
try out the new API,

00:14:49.726 --> 00:14:53.816 A:middle
and we do encourage you to do
so, you could continue to do so.

00:14:54.046 --> 00:14:58.166 A:middle
The old code will continue to
work alongside the new code.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:15:00.396 --> 00:15:03.426 A:middle
So I just told you why you
should make your application

00:15:03.426 --> 00:15:07.096 A:middle
accessible, and I ran
through a few examples of how

00:15:07.096 --> 00:15:11.216 A:middle
to use this brand new API
to make some UIs accessible.

00:15:11.456 --> 00:15:15.946 A:middle
You saw how quickly
and easily we were able

00:15:15.946 --> 00:15:21.516 A:middle
to solve the three
examples I've shown you.

00:15:23.176 --> 00:15:27.686 A:middle
And it really is fast, and it
will shave some time for you

00:15:27.686 --> 00:15:30.826 A:middle
to develop in making sure
your app is accessible.

00:15:31.596 --> 00:15:35.096 A:middle
So with some extra time
you may have on your hands,

00:15:35.096 --> 00:15:36.646 A:middle
I really hope you
could take some

00:15:36.646 --> 00:15:39.046 A:middle
of that time to do some testing.

00:15:39.506 --> 00:15:43.536 A:middle
Because after all, you
know, the code you add?

00:15:43.536 --> 00:15:47.046 A:middle
You want to make sure that it
will be usable by everyone.

00:15:47.876 --> 00:15:52.446 A:middle
So how do you go about making
sure that your app is accessible

00:15:52.566 --> 00:15:53.876 A:middle
after you make those changes?

00:15:54.366 --> 00:15:56.166 A:middle
Well, we have two
tools you could use.

00:15:56.866 --> 00:15:59.676 A:middle
The first is Accessibility
Inspector.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:00.556 --> 00:16:05.166 A:middle
This is a tool that displays all
of the accessibility information

00:16:05.166 --> 00:16:08.216 A:middle
for any piece of UI that's
currently under the mouse.

00:16:08.876 --> 00:16:11.886 A:middle
And with the newest
version of the Inspector,

00:16:12.016 --> 00:16:15.476 A:middle
we will now display the
accessibility properties

00:16:15.576 --> 00:16:16.656 A:middle
of that UI.

00:16:17.396 --> 00:16:19.446 A:middle
So, this is really
helpful, so you know exactly

00:16:19.446 --> 00:16:22.526 A:middle
which properties you
may need to tweak.

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:28.526 A:middle
The second tool we have
is called VoiceOver.

00:16:29.106 --> 00:16:32.336 A:middle
VoiceOver is a screen
reader designed

00:16:32.576 --> 00:16:36.636 A:middle
for the visually challenged
users to be able to explore

00:16:36.816 --> 00:16:39.466 A:middle
and interact with the
content of the screen.

00:16:40.136 --> 00:16:45.206 A:middle
And the users will get feedback
through speech or braille.

00:16:45.866 --> 00:16:47.786 A:middle
So how do you go
about using this?

00:16:47.786 --> 00:16:49.406 A:middle
First you've got to turn it on.

00:16:49.406 --> 00:16:51.926 A:middle
If you just remember
the shortcut:

00:16:51.926 --> 00:16:54.036 A:middle
command F5, that
will turn it on.

00:16:54.886 --> 00:16:57.366 A:middle
Or you can go into the
Accessibility Pref Pane.

00:16:57.486 --> 00:17:00.116 A:middle
There's an Enable
VoiceOver checkbox.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:16:57.486 --> 00:17:00.116 A:middle
There's an Enable
VoiceOver checkbox.

00:17:00.906 --> 00:17:03.576 A:middle
Simply check that and you
can turn VoiceOver on.

00:17:04.935 --> 00:17:07.415 A:middle
So the very first time
you turn VoiceOver on,

00:17:07.586 --> 00:17:09.616 A:middle
it's going to prompt
you to see if you want

00:17:09.616 --> 00:17:10.586 A:middle
to go through a tutorial.

00:17:10.586 --> 00:17:15.116 A:middle
So if you just click on
the Learn More button,

00:17:15.486 --> 00:17:17.185 A:middle
than it will run through
a tutorial with you.

00:17:18.106 --> 00:17:20.185 A:middle
So I really encourage
you to try that.

00:17:20.326 --> 00:17:21.455 A:middle
Run through the tutorial.

00:17:22.925 --> 00:17:25.986 A:middle
Now, VoiceOver is a
very powerful tool,

00:17:26.415 --> 00:17:28.286 A:middle
so it has hundreds of commands.

00:17:29.186 --> 00:17:33.336 A:middle
Well, today I'm going to show
you just five simple commands

00:17:33.426 --> 00:17:36.846 A:middle
you can use to be proficient
in testing with VoiceOver.

00:17:37.086 --> 00:17:41.816 A:middle
The first of that is how you
navigate from one piece of UI

00:17:41.816 --> 00:17:44.716 A:middle
to another: and that's
"control, option, right arrow."

00:17:45.566 --> 00:17:48.266 A:middle
So just remember that once
you have VoiceOver turned on,

00:17:48.816 --> 00:17:53.046 A:middle
any time you press control and
option, any other key you press

00:17:53.046 --> 00:17:55.446 A:middle
at the same time will
automatically turn

00:17:55.446 --> 00:17:56.556 A:middle
into a VoiceOver command.

00:17:57.106 --> 00:18:01.166 A:middle
So we have "control, option,
right arrow" to go to next,


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:17:57.106 --> 00:18:01.166 A:middle
So we have "control, option,
right arrow" to go to next,

00:18:01.166 --> 00:18:02.836 A:middle
and if you want to reverse,

00:18:03.266 --> 00:18:05.316 A:middle
you do "control,
option, left arrow."

00:18:05.926 --> 00:18:09.006 A:middle
And if you want to press a
button or activate something,

00:18:09.356 --> 00:18:11.436 A:middle
simply do "control,
option, space."

00:18:11.836 --> 00:18:16.696 A:middle
This is very similar to pressing
a space bar on something

00:18:16.696 --> 00:18:18.036 A:middle
that has a keyboard focus.

00:18:18.606 --> 00:18:21.106 A:middle
And then we have
two more commands.

00:18:21.586 --> 00:18:24.716 A:middle
One is Enter Group -- which
is "control, option, shift,

00:18:24.716 --> 00:18:27.326 A:middle
down arrow" -- and
Leave Group: "control,

00:18:27.326 --> 00:18:29.046 A:middle
option, shift, up arrow."

00:18:29.896 --> 00:18:30.986 A:middle
So what is "group?"

00:18:31.606 --> 00:18:35.356 A:middle
Well VoiceOver has this
concept of "group" and it goes

00:18:35.356 --> 00:18:37.426 A:middle
like this: If you
have, on the screen...

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:41.456 A:middle
what I have on the
screen is just some window

00:18:41.456 --> 00:18:42.456 A:middle
with lots of UIs.

00:18:43.056 --> 00:18:47.706 A:middle
Well, to be able to navigate
quickly to a certain piece of UI

00:18:48.006 --> 00:18:51.196 A:middle
at any moment, VoiceOver has
this concept of grouping.

00:18:51.546 --> 00:18:53.346 A:middle
On the screen you see
three different groups:

00:18:53.346 --> 00:18:57.886 A:middle
one is the toolbar; the other
one is the table of folders;

00:18:58.416 --> 00:19:03.136 A:middle
and also the collection
view of images.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:18:58.416 --> 00:19:03.136 A:middle
and also the collection
view of images.

00:19:03.256 --> 00:19:06.686 A:middle
To be able to interact...

00:19:06.836 --> 00:19:10.796 A:middle
or, you know, enter
and exit these groups,

00:19:11.516 --> 00:19:14.836 A:middle
like I said earlier you could
just press the Enter Group

00:19:15.076 --> 00:19:16.426 A:middle
or Leave Group command.

00:19:17.586 --> 00:19:21.236 A:middle
So with just these five
VoiceOver commands alone,

00:19:21.236 --> 00:19:23.596 A:middle
you should be pretty good
in testing with VoiceOver.

00:19:24.606 --> 00:19:29.466 A:middle
So now that I have shown
you the tools and run you

00:19:29.466 --> 00:19:34.546 A:middle
through some examples using
the API to implement some

00:19:35.146 --> 00:19:37.306 A:middle
of the UI examples
I've shown you earlier,

00:19:37.746 --> 00:19:40.356 A:middle
I would like to bring
up Chris Dolan to come

00:19:40.356 --> 00:19:42.386 A:middle
up to give you a live demo

00:19:42.386 --> 00:19:45.296 A:middle
of making the Tic Tac
Toe game accessible.

00:19:46.516 --> 00:19:48.666 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:49.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:19:55.066 --> 00:19:55.526 A:middle
Thanks Patti.

00:19:56.416 --> 00:19:58.646 A:middle
Hi, my name is Chris, and
I'm a software engineer

00:19:58.646 --> 00:20:00.176 A:middle
on the OS X Accessibility Team.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:19:58.646 --> 00:20:00.176 A:middle
on the OS X Accessibility Team.

00:20:00.586 --> 00:20:03.386 A:middle
And I'm really excited to
show you just how simple

00:20:03.676 --> 00:20:06.916 A:middle
and just how easy it is to
add accessibility to your app

00:20:06.916 --> 00:20:07.906 A:middle
with our brand new API.

00:20:08.836 --> 00:20:11.446 A:middle
So to do this, I've written
a little test app here,

00:20:11.716 --> 00:20:14.156 A:middle
and it's a very simple
game of Tic Tac Toe.

00:20:14.496 --> 00:20:17.146 A:middle
So in this case the board
is full, the game is over,

00:20:17.146 --> 00:20:19.066 A:middle
and it says the O
player has won.

00:20:19.216 --> 00:20:21.756 A:middle
I can come in and
restart the game,

00:20:22.156 --> 00:20:23.896 A:middle
place some pieces
on the board...

00:20:23.896 --> 00:20:27.816 A:middle
I can even turn on the AI
opponent and play against that.

00:20:27.896 --> 00:20:30.736 A:middle
This is a very simple
application,

00:20:30.736 --> 00:20:33.006 A:middle
and I want to use this kind
of as our launching point

00:20:33.006 --> 00:20:35.256 A:middle
to show you how you would
implement all the different

00:20:35.256 --> 00:20:37.956 A:middle
techniques, that Patti just
told you, in this application.

00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:41.346 A:middle
But before I do that, I
want to give you an idea

00:20:41.346 --> 00:20:42.756 A:middle
of what this application looks

00:20:42.756 --> 00:20:45.156 A:middle
like to someone who's
using VoiceOver.

00:20:45.616 --> 00:20:47.566 A:middle
So, they may have just
heard from social media

00:20:47.566 --> 00:20:50.486 A:middle
that this is the great new app
to have, or that you wrote it

00:20:50.486 --> 00:20:51.416 A:middle
and they want to check it out,

00:20:51.746 --> 00:20:53.246 A:middle
and this is their first
experience with it.

00:20:53.576 --> 00:20:54.546 A:middle
I want you to keep that in mind.

00:20:55.476 --> 00:20:59.046 A:middle
So I'm going to use the keyboard
command to turn on VoiceOver.

00:20:59.816 --> 00:21:01.406 A:middle
So here, two things
have happened


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:20:59.816 --> 00:21:01.406 A:middle
So here, two things
have happened

00:21:01.406 --> 00:21:02.576 A:middle
when I turn VoiceOver on.

00:21:03.056 --> 00:21:04.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You are currently
on a text element.

00:21:05.816 --> 00:21:08.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The first is that the
caption panel has shown

00:21:08.506 --> 00:21:10.476 A:middle
up in the bottom corner.

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:12.286 A:middle
And all this does is it has all

00:21:12.286 --> 00:21:14.346 A:middle
of the text that's
currently being spoken.

00:21:14.926 --> 00:21:17.806 A:middle
So this is really, really
helpful if I'm collaborating

00:21:18.046 --> 00:21:19.616 A:middle
with someone who's
using VoiceOver,

00:21:19.906 --> 00:21:22.106 A:middle
and they often have their speech
cranked up really, really fast.

00:21:22.786 --> 00:21:25.636 A:middle
So here I can read all of
the text that's being spoken,

00:21:25.636 --> 00:21:27.406 A:middle
and it helps me when
I'm collaborating.

00:21:28.016 --> 00:21:32.276 A:middle
The second thing you'll see is
that there's a black box drawn

00:21:32.276 --> 00:21:34.686 A:middle
around the X wins label.

00:21:35.126 --> 00:21:36.886 A:middle
And we call this the
VoiceOver cursor.

00:21:37.236 --> 00:21:39.906 A:middle
You can kind of think of it as
an alternate keyboard focus.

00:21:40.286 --> 00:21:43.506 A:middle
So just like I can press space
on a keyboard-focused element

00:21:43.506 --> 00:21:45.986 A:middle
to do something with that
element, when I press one

00:21:45.986 --> 00:21:49.736 A:middle
of the many VoiceOver commands
(keyboard commands) it normally

00:21:49.736 --> 00:21:52.486 A:middle
acts on the currently
VoiceOver-focused element.

00:21:53.436 --> 00:21:57.936 A:middle
So now what I'd like
to do is turn on a mode

00:21:58.226 --> 00:22:00.226 A:middle
in VoiceOver called
Trackpad Commander.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:21:58.226 --> 00:22:00.226 A:middle
in VoiceOver called
Trackpad Commander.

00:22:00.436 --> 00:22:02.946 A:middle
And all it allows me to
do is just explore the UI

00:22:02.946 --> 00:22:03.866 A:middle
with my finger.

00:22:03.946 --> 00:22:07.926 A:middle
Just like VoiceOver on iOS, I
can move around the interface

00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:10.196 A:middle
and VoiceOver will
speak the descriptions

00:22:10.196 --> 00:22:12.386 A:middle
of all the items
underneath my finger.

00:22:12.386 --> 00:22:13.686 A:middle
I'm going to turn that on.

00:22:15.096 --> 00:22:16.506 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Trackpad Commander on.

00:22:17.386 --> 00:22:19.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And now I'm just gonna
explore around the interface,

00:22:19.656 --> 00:22:22.376 A:middle
and you'll see a blue circle
wherever my finger is.

00:22:23.476 --> 00:22:24.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Close button.

00:22:25.046 --> 00:22:26.266 A:middle
Minimize button.

00:22:26.536 --> 00:22:27.586 A:middle
Dimmed, zoom button.

00:22:27.786 --> 00:22:29.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great. So the
toolbar is looking good.

00:22:30.376 --> 00:22:32.816 A:middle
But you'll notice anywhere

00:22:32.816 --> 00:22:34.906 A:middle
where there's no elements
there's this sound being

00:22:34.906 --> 00:22:35.096 A:middle
played [beeping].

00:22:35.096 --> 00:22:36.616 A:middle
It says this is empty
space [beeping].

00:22:37.376 --> 00:22:39.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Tic Tac Toe.

00:22:39.886 --> 00:22:42.236 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay. Title is good.

00:22:42.476 --> 00:22:43.456 A:middle
[Beeping] empty space here.

00:22:43.656 --> 00:22:44.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; X wins.

00:22:44.636 --> 00:22:46.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Okay the label shows up fine.

00:22:47.216 --> 00:22:48.856 A:middle
[Beeping] more empty space.

00:22:49.776 --> 00:22:51.796 A:middle
Ah, we've hit our first
problem [beeping].

00:22:52.926 --> 00:22:55.346 A:middle
There's nothing being
reported here

00:22:55.346 --> 00:22:57.166 A:middle
for accessibility
for this checkbox.

00:22:57.396 --> 00:22:59.616 A:middle
So this is one of the
problems we'll have to fix.

00:22:59.776 --> 00:23:00.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Difficulty.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:22:59.776 --> 00:23:00.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Difficulty.

00:23:00.926 --> 00:23:02.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Difficulty's fine.

00:23:02.086 --> 00:23:02.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; 2.

00:23:02.656 --> 00:23:03.436 A:middle
&gt;&gt; As well as the level.

00:23:03.716 --> 00:23:04.636 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Button, button.

00:23:05.116 --> 00:23:05.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:23:05.666 --> 00:23:07.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; 2. Button, button.

00:23:07.436 --> 00:23:09.816 A:middle
Delete. 1.41%.

00:23:10.586 --> 00:23:12.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So we saw there's a
problem with the buttons.

00:23:12.596 --> 00:23:13.406 A:middle
It just says "button."

00:23:13.706 --> 00:23:17.096 A:middle
So if I'm not a sighted user,
I don't understand what's going

00:23:17.146 --> 00:23:21.616 A:middle
on with this button; what
does it do when I click it?

00:23:21.696 --> 00:23:22.576 A:middle
[Beeping] More empty space.

00:23:22.986 --> 00:23:25.726 A:middle
And again, the Restart
Game button's the same way;

00:23:25.726 --> 00:23:27.426 A:middle
there's absolutely
no information

00:23:27.426 --> 00:23:28.966 A:middle
for accessibility there.

00:23:29.036 --> 00:23:30.996 A:middle
What about the grid?

00:23:31.236 --> 00:23:32.606 A:middle
Well I had the same
problem here.

00:23:32.886 --> 00:23:35.676 A:middle
The grid isn't even being
reported to accessibility.

00:23:35.676 --> 00:23:36.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver off.

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:39.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So as you can see,
the user experience

00:23:39.376 --> 00:23:42.086 A:middle
for this application is quite
poor when using VoiceOver.

00:23:42.086 --> 00:23:44.056 A:middle
A lot of the major functionality

00:23:44.056 --> 00:23:45.626 A:middle
for this app just
doesn't show up.

00:23:45.626 --> 00:23:46.666 A:middle
I can't play a piece.

00:23:46.666 --> 00:23:48.136 A:middle
I can't restart the game.

00:23:48.816 --> 00:23:50.336 A:middle
I can't play against the AI

00:23:50.336 --> 00:23:52.186 A:middle
because I can't click
that checkbox.

00:23:52.776 --> 00:23:55.056 A:middle
So what I'd like to do
is take you through each

00:23:55.056 --> 00:23:57.966 A:middle
of these individual
elements and show you how

00:23:57.966 --> 00:23:58.886 A:middle
to make them accessible.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:03.056 --> 00:24:04.696 A:middle
So here's my Xcode project.

00:24:05.016 --> 00:24:06.676 A:middle
And before we even
talk about the code,

00:24:07.196 --> 00:24:09.306 A:middle
I just want to orient
you to, kind of,

00:24:09.306 --> 00:24:10.496 A:middle
the layout of this project.

00:24:11.286 --> 00:24:11.976 A:middle
So over here...

00:24:12.256 --> 00:24:14.716 A:middle
this is a classic MVC style app.

00:24:14.716 --> 00:24:16.656 A:middle
I have all of my models,
and these are the files

00:24:17.186 --> 00:24:19.746 A:middle
that encapsulate, you know,
the Tic Tac Toe board...

00:24:19.746 --> 00:24:20.806 A:middle
and the game rules...

00:24:20.806 --> 00:24:22.686 A:middle
and what it means
to win the game.

00:24:23.216 --> 00:24:25.096 A:middle
We're not going to touch
any of the model files here.

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:25.996 A:middle
This is the game state.

00:24:25.996 --> 00:24:27.656 A:middle
We don't need that.

00:24:28.086 --> 00:24:30.156 A:middle
The next folder is
all of the views.

00:24:30.726 --> 00:24:33.036 A:middle
So we have a lot of custom
UI in this application

00:24:33.656 --> 00:24:36.046 A:middle
and we need views to back them.

00:24:36.136 --> 00:24:38.256 A:middle
These are all of the files
that we use to do that.

00:24:39.306 --> 00:24:41.186 A:middle
This is where we're going
to be spending a majority

00:24:41.186 --> 00:24:42.696 A:middle
of our time in the code.

00:24:43.086 --> 00:24:45.226 A:middle
We also have the
controller section.

00:24:45.346 --> 00:24:46.846 A:middle
The AppDelegate is
currently empty.

00:24:47.306 --> 00:24:50.136 A:middle
And the Tic Tac Toe view
controller is the thing

00:24:50.136 --> 00:24:51.896 A:middle
that hooks up all
the UI interactions

00:24:51.896 --> 00:24:52.956 A:middle
with the monologue jacks.

00:24:53.896 --> 00:24:57.306 A:middle
The last thing I want to point
out is the main menu nib.

00:24:57.446 --> 00:25:00.306 A:middle
This is the one and only
nib for this entire project.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:24:57.446 --> 00:25:00.306 A:middle
This is the one and only
nib for this entire project.

00:25:00.756 --> 00:25:03.426 A:middle
And this is actually where
we're going to start.

00:25:03.896 --> 00:25:07.126 A:middle
So the first elements we're
going to work on are the plus

00:25:07.126 --> 00:25:08.966 A:middle
and minus buttons here
for the difficulty.

00:25:09.626 --> 00:25:11.916 A:middle
If you remember, this is one of
the items that we could land on,

00:25:11.916 --> 00:25:13.686 A:middle
but there was no
contextual information

00:25:13.686 --> 00:25:15.516 A:middle
about what these buttons did.

00:25:16.276 --> 00:25:18.156 A:middle
So I'd like to show you how
to add accessibility to that

00:25:18.156 --> 00:25:18.966 A:middle
in two different ways.

00:25:20.266 --> 00:25:21.626 A:middle
The first is actually
quite simple.

00:25:21.656 --> 00:25:25.766 A:middle
I'm just going to select that
element in Interface Builder.

00:25:26.436 --> 00:25:29.386 A:middle
And then up in the top right
I can open up the panel.

00:25:29.776 --> 00:25:35.566 A:middle
And the third icon from the
left is the Identity Inspector.

00:25:36.376 --> 00:25:39.736 A:middle
And in here is the Accessibility
Identity information.

00:25:39.736 --> 00:25:40.636 A:middle
So this is where I'm going

00:25:40.636 --> 00:25:42.046 A:middle
to add the description
for this button.

00:25:43.126 --> 00:25:44.126 A:middle
So what does this button do?

00:25:44.126 --> 00:25:47.216 A:middle
Well, when I click it, it
decreases the difficulty.

00:25:47.496 --> 00:25:51.736 A:middle
So I'm just going to
type that in here.

00:25:52.126 --> 00:25:53.596 A:middle
Great. And that's
all I had to do.

00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:54.336 A:middle
Very simple.

00:25:55.696 --> 00:25:58.766 A:middle
So what about if I
decide that I want

00:25:58.766 --> 00:26:00.866 A:middle
to do the same thing,
but in code?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:25:58.766 --> 00:26:00.866 A:middle
to do the same thing,
but in code?

00:26:01.286 --> 00:26:02.846 A:middle
Well it turns out
that's really simple too.

00:26:02.846 --> 00:26:04.986 A:middle
So I can go over to
my view controller.

00:26:05.706 --> 00:26:10.056 A:middle
And in my awakeFromNib, here I
can pull out the button cell.

00:26:16.126 --> 00:26:21.186 A:middle
And I have an outlet
to that button.

00:26:21.736 --> 00:26:24.176 A:middle
And then I can use one of the
new accessibility properties

00:26:24.176 --> 00:26:25.866 A:middle
to just set the accessibility
label.

00:26:28.186 --> 00:26:31.776 A:middle
And remember, you always want
to localize these strings.

00:26:37.106 --> 00:26:40.026 A:middle
Okay. And this is the
increase difficulty button.

00:26:40.176 --> 00:26:43.136 A:middle
So I'm just going
to add that in.

00:26:45.256 --> 00:26:46.986 A:middle
Okay. Just like that.

00:26:46.986 --> 00:26:47.716 A:middle
That's all I need to do.

00:26:48.196 --> 00:26:51.876 A:middle
And with that, now when
a VoiceOver user lands

00:26:51.876 --> 00:26:53.836 A:middle
on these plus and minus
buttons, they'll be read

00:26:53.836 --> 00:26:56.856 A:middle
as the increase difficulty or
the decrease difficulty buttons.

00:26:57.146 --> 00:27:00.576 A:middle
So why did we get that
accessibility for free?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:26:57.146 --> 00:27:00.576 A:middle
So why did we get that
accessibility for free?

00:27:00.576 --> 00:27:02.176 A:middle
Why did they even show
up in the first place?

00:27:03.026 --> 00:27:06.716 A:middle
Well, this custom class is
actually a subclass of NSButton.

00:27:07.176 --> 00:27:09.146 A:middle
So we've done a lot of
work behind the scenes

00:27:09.146 --> 00:27:12.496 A:middle
to bake accessibility in to all
of the standard AppKit controls.

00:27:12.856 --> 00:27:15.256 A:middle
So whenever possible, try to
use those because we've done

00:27:15.256 --> 00:27:16.536 A:middle
as much work as possible
for you.

00:27:16.886 --> 00:27:19.346 A:middle
The one thing we needed to
do is just add a description

00:27:19.346 --> 00:27:20.106 A:middle
which is quite simple.

00:27:22.366 --> 00:27:24.256 A:middle
So now that we've worked on
the "plus" and "minus" buttons,

00:27:24.256 --> 00:27:27.006 A:middle
let's move on to the
Restart Game button.

00:27:27.006 --> 00:27:30.236 A:middle
You might recall that this
was one of the items that...

00:27:30.236 --> 00:27:32.156 A:middle
nothing was reported
there for accessibility.

00:27:32.616 --> 00:27:33.676 A:middle
Let's take a look at why.

00:27:35.236 --> 00:27:37.316 A:middle
So I have a class
for this button.

00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:41.566 A:middle
And the first thing I
immediately notice is

00:27:41.566 --> 00:27:43.056 A:middle
that it's an NSView subclass.

00:27:43.886 --> 00:27:46.636 A:middle
I'm doing a lot of extra
work behind the scenes

00:27:46.936 --> 00:27:49.586 A:middle
to make this view act
and look like a button.

00:27:49.806 --> 00:27:51.326 A:middle
This includes all
of my own keyboard

00:27:51.326 --> 00:27:54.566 A:middle
and mouse event handling, as
well as all of my own drawing.

00:27:54.776 --> 00:27:56.256 A:middle
I'm doing a ton of
extra work here.

00:27:57.276 --> 00:28:00.586 A:middle
Well, how do I add
accessibility to this element?


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:27:57.276 --> 00:28:00.586 A:middle
Well, how do I add
accessibility to this element?

00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:02.926 A:middle
It turns out it's
also quite simple.

00:28:02.926 --> 00:28:05.856 A:middle
All I need to do is pick
the accessibility protocol

00:28:06.256 --> 00:28:08.186 A:middle
that best represents
this object.

00:28:09.246 --> 00:28:13.756 A:middle
The protocol for this is the
NSAccessibilityButton protocol.

00:28:15.036 --> 00:28:16.916 A:middle
Now that I've conformed
to that protocol,

00:28:17.336 --> 00:28:19.616 A:middle
I can move into my
implemenntation file.

00:28:21.136 --> 00:28:24.526 A:middle
And the first thing I see
is I get two new warnings.

00:28:24.896 --> 00:28:27.046 A:middle
So this is really,
really helpful for me,

00:28:27.046 --> 00:28:29.576 A:middle
because now I know exactly
what I need to implement

00:28:29.776 --> 00:28:32.676 A:middle
to add accessibility
to this custom control.

00:28:33.676 --> 00:28:35.886 A:middle
The two methods here
are accessibilityLabel

00:28:35.886 --> 00:28:37.636 A:middle
and accessibilityPerformPress.

00:28:37.956 --> 00:28:39.166 A:middle
So let's take those
one at a time.

00:28:40.616 --> 00:28:42.626 A:middle
I have a section here
for Accessibility.

00:28:43.506 --> 00:28:45.446 A:middle
The first one is
accessibilityLabel.

00:28:48.806 --> 00:28:52.966 A:middle
Great. Now what do I
want to be returned here?

00:28:53.736 --> 00:28:56.926 A:middle
I happen to know that this
button is only ever used

00:28:56.926 --> 00:28:58.776 A:middle
to draw the Restart Game button.

00:28:59.326 --> 00:29:01.946 A:middle
So the label for this is just
going to be "restart game."


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:28:59.326 --> 00:29:01.946 A:middle
So the label for this is just
going to be "restart game."

00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:11.576 A:middle
That's it.

00:29:12.156 --> 00:29:14.496 A:middle
So now I can go back up
to the top of my file.

00:29:14.606 --> 00:29:16.376 A:middle
I notice that warning
has gone away.

00:29:16.546 --> 00:29:18.326 A:middle
So I only have one more
method to implement.

00:29:18.826 --> 00:29:20.386 A:middle
And that's
accessibilityPerformPress.

00:29:21.706 --> 00:29:22.176 A:middle
Let's do that.

00:29:27.046 --> 00:29:27.716 A:middle
"performPress."

00:29:28.906 --> 00:29:30.696 A:middle
So what should happen here?

00:29:31.476 --> 00:29:34.976 A:middle
Well, when I use the mouse to
interact with this button --

00:29:35.476 --> 00:29:36.986 A:middle
when I click it something
happens, right?

00:29:37.386 --> 00:29:39.066 A:middle
That same something
should happen

00:29:39.156 --> 00:29:41.126 A:middle
when an accessibility
client says, "hey,

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:42.596 A:middle
I want to activate this item."

00:29:43.366 --> 00:29:47.976 A:middle
So in my case, I happen to have
a method called pressDown...

00:29:49.676 --> 00:29:50.766 A:middle
or performPress rather.

00:29:51.286 --> 00:29:53.286 A:middle
And performPress
is what gets called

00:29:53.286 --> 00:29:55.486 A:middle
when the mouse handling
logic says "yes,

00:29:55.486 --> 00:29:56.576 A:middle
this button has been pressed."

00:29:57.086 --> 00:29:59.116 A:middle
So I want to call that
same, exact method.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:06.046 --> 00:30:06.466 A:middle
And now you notice

00:30:06.466 --> 00:30:09.316 A:middle
that accessibilityPerformPress
return is a Boolean.

00:30:09.816 --> 00:30:11.906 A:middle
This is a yes-or-no,
"did I handle this?"

00:30:11.906 --> 00:30:15.796 A:middle
event. And I'm always handling
it, so yes, I return "YES."

00:30:17.036 --> 00:30:20.086 A:middle
And with that I can go back
up to the top of my file

00:30:20.426 --> 00:30:22.886 A:middle
and I see all of my
warnings have gone away.

00:30:23.546 --> 00:30:24.156 A:middle
So that's it.

00:30:24.606 --> 00:30:26.286 A:middle
The protocol has guided
me through what I needed

00:30:26.286 --> 00:30:27.486 A:middle
to do to add accessibility.

00:30:27.756 --> 00:30:29.346 A:middle
I implemented that
and I'm finished.

00:30:32.276 --> 00:30:34.626 A:middle
So now that this lower
right section's finished,

00:30:34.776 --> 00:30:37.846 A:middle
I want to work on the Artificial
Intelligence checkbox.

00:30:38.526 --> 00:30:40.266 A:middle
If you recall again,
this was another element

00:30:40.266 --> 00:30:42.056 A:middle
that wasn't visible to
accessibility at all.

00:30:43.116 --> 00:30:47.006 A:middle
So I have my header file
here for the checkbox.

00:30:47.626 --> 00:30:50.256 A:middle
And again I see the same
situation I had with the button.

00:30:50.936 --> 00:30:52.086 A:middle
It's an NSView subclass.

00:30:52.396 --> 00:30:55.686 A:middle
So I do a lot of work to make
it look and act like a checkbox.

00:30:56.646 --> 00:31:00.356 A:middle
So in this case, I need
to pick a protocol.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:30:56.646 --> 00:31:00.356 A:middle
So in this case, I need
to pick a protocol.

00:31:00.606 --> 00:31:04.686 A:middle
And the protocol for this is
the NSAccessibilityCheckBox

00:31:04.686 --> 00:31:05.126 A:middle
protocol.

00:31:07.976 --> 00:31:12.426 A:middle
And now when I go into my
implementation file I get a few

00:31:12.426 --> 00:31:13.016 A:middle
new warnings.

00:31:13.016 --> 00:31:14.566 A:middle
So this tells me
what I need to do

00:31:14.566 --> 00:31:15.866 A:middle
to make the checkbox accessible.

00:31:16.526 --> 00:31:20.866 A:middle
So the three warnings I have
here are accessibilityValue.

00:31:21.436 --> 00:31:22.496 A:middle
accessibilityLabel.

00:31:22.666 --> 00:31:24.256 A:middle
And accessibilityPerformPress.

00:31:25.006 --> 00:31:28.976 A:middle
So I'm going to take
those one at a time.

00:31:29.216 --> 00:31:31.946 A:middle
So the first one, we've
seen this one before,

00:31:31.946 --> 00:31:38.376 A:middle
is accessibilityLabel, so
I'm going to do that first.

00:31:38.586 --> 00:31:40.736 A:middle
So what should be the
label for this checkbox?

00:31:41.366 --> 00:31:43.146 A:middle
Well this is a control
that I designed

00:31:43.146 --> 00:31:45.886 A:middle
and I thought I might
reuse in other places.

00:31:45.946 --> 00:31:47.346 A:middle
So I actually have an iVar

00:31:47.346 --> 00:31:49.106 A:middle
around that keeps
the checkbox text.

00:31:49.276 --> 00:31:52.176 A:middle
This is the string that actually
gets rendered in and drawn

00:31:52.356 --> 00:31:53.526 A:middle
in the drawInRect method.

00:31:54.546 --> 00:31:58.276 A:middle
So I can just return
the checkbox text here.

00:31:59.886 --> 00:32:01.916 A:middle
Great. So one of my
warnings has gone away.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:31:59.886 --> 00:32:01.916 A:middle
Great. So one of my
warnings has gone away.

00:32:02.256 --> 00:32:06.136 A:middle
The next one I want to work on
is accessibilityPerformPress.

00:32:06.726 --> 00:32:08.326 A:middle
So just like the
button, when I interact

00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:11.126 A:middle
with this control using the
mouse, something happens

00:32:11.456 --> 00:32:13.416 A:middle
that changes the checked state.

00:32:13.656 --> 00:32:15.406 A:middle
I need that same
something to happen

00:32:15.836 --> 00:32:17.676 A:middle
when the accessibility
clients say "hey,

00:32:17.856 --> 00:32:19.416 A:middle
I want to interact
with this element."

00:32:20.526 --> 00:32:23.226 A:middle
So that's the
accessibilityPerformPress.

00:32:29.196 --> 00:32:32.056 A:middle
And I have a method
called toggleCheckedState.

00:32:32.056 --> 00:32:35.366 A:middle
And this is what gets called
from the mouse handling logic.

00:32:36.156 --> 00:32:38.416 A:middle
And just like with the
button, I return "YES,"

00:32:38.526 --> 00:32:41.306 A:middle
I did in fact handle
this action.

00:32:41.306 --> 00:32:45.576 A:middle
So now if I go back
up to the top I see

00:32:45.576 --> 00:32:48.206 A:middle
that I still have one more
method I need to implement.

00:32:48.776 --> 00:32:50.256 A:middle
And this is accessibilityValue.

00:32:51.116 --> 00:32:52.486 A:middle
And at this point
I ask myself, well,

00:32:52.796 --> 00:32:54.396 A:middle
"what is the value
for a checkbox?

00:32:54.396 --> 00:32:55.356 A:middle
What am I supposed to return?"

00:32:56.606 --> 00:32:59.266 A:middle
We've worked really, really
hard to try to answer all

00:32:59.266 --> 00:33:00.706 A:middle
of these questions in one place.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:32:59.266 --> 00:33:00.706 A:middle
of these questions in one place.

00:33:01.186 --> 00:33:04.246 A:middle
We tried to make
NSAccessibilityProtocol file the

00:33:04.246 --> 00:33:05.566 A:middle
one-stop-shop for this.

00:33:05.996 --> 00:33:08.926 A:middle
This is where all the protocols
are implemented or defined.

00:33:10.076 --> 00:33:12.586 A:middle
So in another tab I have
this protocol's file.

00:33:13.366 --> 00:33:16.746 A:middle
And there is the
NSAccessibilityCheckbox protocol

00:33:16.746 --> 00:33:17.156 A:middle
right here.

00:33:17.966 --> 00:33:21.606 A:middle
And I see under the required
methods the AccessibilityValue

00:33:21.706 --> 00:33:22.776 A:middle
returns an NSNumber.

00:33:23.086 --> 00:33:24.716 A:middle
Okay, so that answers
my first question.

00:33:24.746 --> 00:33:28.556 A:middle
And it says I return "yes" if
checked, or "no" if unchecked.

00:33:29.906 --> 00:33:31.656 A:middle
Great. So now that I
have this information,

00:33:32.236 --> 00:33:36.556 A:middle
I can come down here and
implement that method.

00:33:37.116 --> 00:33:39.576 A:middle
So here I have another
iVar around,

00:33:40.166 --> 00:33:41.536 A:middle
which is "am I checked or not.?"

00:33:41.536 --> 00:33:44.926 A:middle
I can use that to
return "yes" or "no."

00:33:54.046 --> 00:33:54.436 A:middle
Oh return.

00:33:55.646 --> 00:33:56.646 A:middle
All right.

00:33:57.026 --> 00:33:59.466 A:middle
Okay. So now I can go back
up to the top of my file.

00:33:59.816 --> 00:34:01.206 A:middle
I see all the warnings
have gone away.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:33:59.816 --> 00:34:01.206 A:middle
I see all the warnings
have gone away.

00:34:01.946 --> 00:34:02.906 A:middle
So this is all I need to do

00:34:02.906 --> 00:34:04.846 A:middle
to implement an accessible
CheckBox.

00:34:07.746 --> 00:34:09.565 A:middle
So now the entire
right-hand side

00:34:09.565 --> 00:34:13.166 A:middle
of our application has added
some basic accessibility to it.

00:34:14.056 --> 00:34:15.896 A:middle
So let's work on the next
part, which is the grid,

00:34:15.896 --> 00:34:19.606 A:middle
and this is perhaps the
most difficult part.

00:34:20.616 --> 00:34:22.706 A:middle
Again, I'm going to
back into my project,

00:34:22.706 --> 00:34:26.025 A:middle
and I have a view
representing the board --

00:34:26.136 --> 00:34:26.936 A:middle
it's the board view.

00:34:27.505 --> 00:34:30.176 A:middle
And here I notice:
it's, again, an NSView.

00:34:30.366 --> 00:34:31.876 A:middle
I'm doing all of my
own drawing here.

00:34:32.536 --> 00:34:36.196 A:middle
And in fact this class draws
the board and all of the pieces.

00:34:38.136 --> 00:34:39.906 A:middle
So I need to make
this accessible.

00:34:40.376 --> 00:34:41.726 A:middle
And I need to pick
a protocol now.

00:34:41.786 --> 00:34:44.056 A:middle
So what protocol do I need?

00:34:45.036 --> 00:34:46.246 A:middle
Well the way that
I like to think

00:34:46.246 --> 00:34:49.466 A:middle
about the Tic Tac Toe board
is it's really a collection

00:34:49.496 --> 00:34:50.946 A:middle
of squares, right?

00:34:51.315 --> 00:34:52.876 A:middle
Every time I interact
with the board,

00:34:52.876 --> 00:34:55.856 A:middle
it's not so much a board --
I want to play this square;

00:34:55.856 --> 00:34:58.496 A:middle
I want to put my piece there;
I want to get three in a row

00:34:58.496 --> 00:34:59.976 A:middle
to win; I want to
block my opponent

00:34:59.976 --> 00:35:00.896 A:middle
from getting three in a row.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:34:59.976 --> 00:35:00.896 A:middle
from getting three in a row.

00:35:01.546 --> 00:35:04.546 A:middle
And so this board is
really a collection to me.

00:35:05.176 --> 00:35:06.036 A:middle
And the way that that's...

00:35:06.036 --> 00:35:08.716 A:middle
the protocol that you
can use to represent

00:35:08.716 --> 00:35:11.406 A:middle
that is the NSAccessibilityGroup
protocol.

00:35:11.456 --> 00:35:12.836 A:middle
It's a collection of things.

00:35:14.776 --> 00:35:19.886 A:middle
Great. So now I go to
my implementation file.

00:35:20.786 --> 00:35:25.276 A:middle
And I notice I have no
warnings showing up.

00:35:32.446 --> 00:35:33.436 A:middle
Okay. I have no warnings.

00:35:33.436 --> 00:35:34.556 A:middle
So what does this mean?

00:35:34.976 --> 00:35:38.016 A:middle
Well I have no required
methods that I need to implement

00:35:38.016 --> 00:35:39.726 A:middle
for the accessibilityGroup
protocol.

00:35:40.576 --> 00:35:43.606 A:middle
But just like with what we
saw with the other elements,

00:35:43.996 --> 00:35:45.926 A:middle
I can still add accessibility
to it.

00:35:46.836 --> 00:35:48.476 A:middle
So what's the first
thing I want to do?

00:35:49.026 --> 00:35:52.116 A:middle
Well, the board view
-- when I land on it --

00:35:52.116 --> 00:35:54.926 A:middle
it's a group and I want
some label to describe it.

00:35:55.436 --> 00:35:58.526 A:middle
So just like with all the
other controls I'm going

00:35:58.526 --> 00:36:00.316 A:middle
to add a label here.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:35:58.526 --> 00:36:00.316 A:middle
to add a label here.

00:36:00.606 --> 00:36:02.306 A:middle
An accessibilityLabel
is very simple.

00:36:03.816 --> 00:36:04.906 A:middle
So what am I going
to return here?

00:36:04.966 --> 00:36:06.886 A:middle
Well just, it's the
Tic Tac Toe board.

00:36:07.166 --> 00:36:09.536 A:middle
So when the VoiceOver
cursor lands on this,

00:36:09.536 --> 00:36:11.476 A:middle
it says this is the "Tic
Tac Toe board" group.

00:36:13.236 --> 00:36:15.716 A:middle
Okay, so I have a group
that contains things.

00:36:15.796 --> 00:36:17.216 A:middle
Well what are these things?

00:36:17.866 --> 00:36:19.716 A:middle
They're individual squares.

00:36:20.196 --> 00:36:22.786 A:middle
But each of those squares
doesn't have a backing view

00:36:22.786 --> 00:36:23.176 A:middle
to them.

00:36:23.566 --> 00:36:24.996 A:middle
So I need to create some object

00:36:24.996 --> 00:36:26.616 A:middle
to represent it to
accessibility.

00:36:26.756 --> 00:36:28.386 A:middle
And the way that
we've done this is

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:30.476 A:middle
with the NSAccessibilityElement.

00:36:31.836 --> 00:36:34.116 A:middle
Patti showed you in the slides
how you'd create an instance

00:36:34.116 --> 00:36:34.966 A:middle
of this inline.

00:36:35.316 --> 00:36:38.236 A:middle
And what I've chosen to do
here is just create a subclass

00:36:38.236 --> 00:36:39.326 A:middle
of it in another file.

00:36:40.576 --> 00:36:45.536 A:middle
So I have a subclass here
called the TicTacToeSquare

00:36:45.846 --> 00:36:46.956 A:middle
AccessibilityElement.

00:36:47.556 --> 00:36:50.466 A:middle
And it's a subclass of
NSAccessibilityElement.

00:36:50.816 --> 00:36:53.466 A:middle
It has one initializer,
which takes a row,

00:36:53.466 --> 00:36:54.346 A:middle
a column, and a delegate.

00:36:54.346 --> 00:36:57.756 A:middle
And it has three properties: a
row, a column, and a delegate.

00:36:57.786 --> 00:37:00.786 A:middle
So the delegate method
-- or the delegate --


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:36:57.786 --> 00:37:00.786 A:middle
So the delegate method
-- or the delegate --

00:37:00.786 --> 00:37:03.716 A:middle
is just a class that can
answer questions about "hey,

00:37:03.716 --> 00:37:06.166 A:middle
what pieces are at this
location on the board?

00:37:06.166 --> 00:37:07.246 A:middle
Is the game over?

00:37:07.246 --> 00:37:08.256 A:middle
Is it still in progress?"

00:37:08.256 --> 00:37:10.166 A:middle
So it can answer a
lot of the questions

00:37:10.166 --> 00:37:12.396 A:middle
that this piece is
going to need to ask.

00:37:13.726 --> 00:37:17.296 A:middle
So I have this element
representing it.

00:37:17.936 --> 00:37:19.876 A:middle
Well, I'm going to
pick a protocol now

00:37:19.876 --> 00:37:21.106 A:middle
to use to implement it.

00:37:21.876 --> 00:37:24.636 A:middle
So what best encapsulates
what a square does?

00:37:25.506 --> 00:37:27.656 A:middle
Well when I click on
it, something happens.

00:37:27.656 --> 00:37:29.006 A:middle
I place my piece there.

00:37:29.006 --> 00:37:30.136 A:middle
I put my piece there.

00:37:30.136 --> 00:37:32.876 A:middle
I play it, right?

00:37:32.876 --> 00:37:35.336 A:middle
And elements where you click
them to interact with them

00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:36.396 A:middle
and they do something
are buttons.

00:37:37.236 --> 00:37:37.996 A:middle
So I can conform

00:37:37.996 --> 00:37:39.396 A:middle
to the
accessibilityButtonProtocol

00:37:39.396 --> 00:37:39.666 A:middle
here.

00:37:41.596 --> 00:37:43.576 A:middle
And now when I move into
my implementation file,

00:37:46.376 --> 00:37:48.156 A:middle
I'll get a bunch of
warnings for the items

00:37:48.156 --> 00:37:48.966 A:middle
that I need to implement.

00:37:50.386 --> 00:37:54.386 A:middle
So the four warnings I get here
are accessibilityParent, Label,

00:37:54.626 --> 00:37:57.106 A:middle
PerformPress, and Frame
need to be implemented.

00:37:57.106 --> 00:37:59.036 A:middle
So I'm going to take
these one at a time.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:00.066 --> 00:38:04.606 A:middle
For the frame and for the
parent, I'm just going

00:38:04.606 --> 00:38:07.166 A:middle
to return whatever my
superclass' implementation is.

00:38:07.576 --> 00:38:10.156 A:middle
So at some point these will need
to be set, so keep that in mind.

00:38:11.176 --> 00:38:13.716 A:middle
The accessibilityLabel is a
little bit more interesting.

00:38:14.526 --> 00:38:17.666 A:middle
And this is the description
for a particular square.

00:38:18.236 --> 00:38:22.096 A:middle
So what I'm going to do is
ask my delegate for "hey,

00:38:22.096 --> 00:38:24.016 A:middle
what's this square at
my row and column?"

00:38:24.786 --> 00:38:26.636 A:middle
And this is actually an instance

00:38:26.636 --> 00:38:29.056 A:middle
of the model object representing
a square on the board.

00:38:30.526 --> 00:38:34.406 A:middle
And then I can ask the board,
using one of its class methods,

00:38:34.966 --> 00:38:36.436 A:middle
"what's the description
for this square?"

00:38:36.766 --> 00:38:38.386 A:middle
So this is going to
return something like,

00:38:38.746 --> 00:38:41.366 A:middle
"this is an X square
at the top right."

00:38:41.476 --> 00:38:42.926 A:middle
Or an "O square in the center."

00:38:43.336 --> 00:38:44.946 A:middle
Or an "empty square
at the bottom left."

00:38:45.876 --> 00:38:47.936 A:middle
And so when I land
on this element,

00:38:47.936 --> 00:38:49.396 A:middle
that's what I want
to be spoken out.

00:38:50.756 --> 00:38:52.646 A:middle
And then the last method I need

00:38:52.646 --> 00:38:55.056 A:middle
to implement is
accessibilityPerformPress.

00:38:55.746 --> 00:38:57.756 A:middle
So when this item is
pressed, what should it do?

00:38:57.836 --> 00:38:59.696 A:middle
Well, I want to play my
piece there; I want to play

00:38:59.696 --> 00:39:01.416 A:middle
that square; I want
to make my mark there.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:38:59.696 --> 00:39:01.416 A:middle
that square; I want
to make my mark there.

00:39:02.236 --> 00:39:03.276 A:middle
And my delegate knows how

00:39:03.276 --> 00:39:05.106 A:middle
to play a square at
a row and column.

00:39:05.106 --> 00:39:08.076 A:middle
So I'm just going to ask it to
do that and again, return "yes,

00:39:08.076 --> 00:39:08.926 A:middle
I handled this event."

00:39:11.326 --> 00:39:14.466 A:middle
So with that I can go back up
to the top of my file and I see

00:39:14.466 --> 00:39:15.686 A:middle
that all the warnings
have gone away.

00:39:15.766 --> 00:39:16.726 A:middle
So that's great.

00:39:16.726 --> 00:39:20.106 A:middle
I have, now, a class that
represents an individual square

00:39:20.386 --> 00:39:22.846 A:middle
for accessibility that
doesn't have a backing view.

00:39:24.336 --> 00:39:25.976 A:middle
So now I need to go
back to my group.

00:39:26.846 --> 00:39:29.166 A:middle
I need to create
instances of this class

00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:30.306 A:middle
to represent each square.

00:39:31.316 --> 00:39:32.666 A:middle
So I'm back in my board view.

00:39:32.666 --> 00:39:37.606 A:middle
And I want to say, "this group
has children of these elements."

00:39:37.906 --> 00:39:41.586 A:middle
And the way to do
that with our API is

00:39:41.586 --> 00:39:44.216 A:middle
to override the
accessibilityChildren method.

00:39:44.846 --> 00:39:48.686 A:middle
So I'm going to walk through
-- it looks like a lot of code;

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:50.626 A:middle
I promise it's not -- I'm
going to walk through,

00:39:50.626 --> 00:39:51.786 A:middle
line-by-line, what this does.

00:39:53.606 --> 00:39:54.976 A:middle
The first thing is,

00:39:54.976 --> 00:39:58.126 A:middle
I'm overriding the
accessibilityChildren array.

00:39:58.166 --> 00:40:00.386 A:middle
So, I'm the accessibility
ChildrenGetter


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:39:58.166 --> 00:40:00.386 A:middle
So, I'm the accessibility
ChildrenGetter

00:40:00.386 --> 00:40:02.946 A:middle
and returning an array from it.

00:40:02.946 --> 00:40:03.866 A:middle
I have iVar around.

00:40:04.246 --> 00:40:05.816 A:middle
So if I've already
created my children,

00:40:05.816 --> 00:40:07.026 A:middle
I don't need to create
them again.

00:40:07.906 --> 00:40:10.596 A:middle
And if I haven't, I
create an array to hold all

00:40:10.756 --> 00:40:12.096 A:middle
of the accessibility Children.

00:40:12.266 --> 00:40:14.276 A:middle
And then I set up two
variables that I'm going

00:40:14.276 --> 00:40:16.256 A:middle
to be using during
my computations.

00:40:17.706 --> 00:40:19.726 A:middle
Now what I need to do
is create an instance

00:40:19.726 --> 00:40:22.916 A:middle
of that accessibility element
for every square on the board.

00:40:22.916 --> 00:40:27.186 A:middle
So I'm going to iterate over all
the rows and all the columns...

00:40:27.296 --> 00:40:29.756 A:middle
and then instantiate one

00:40:29.756 --> 00:40:32.236 A:middle
of those accessibility
elements for the square.

00:40:33.976 --> 00:40:37.196 A:middle
Now remember that the parent
and the frame were just returned

00:40:37.196 --> 00:40:39.136 A:middle
as whatever the super-classes'
implementation was.

00:40:39.776 --> 00:40:41.356 A:middle
So I need to make sure
that they're set somewhere,

00:40:41.426 --> 00:40:42.766 A:middle
and that's what I'm
going to do it here.

00:40:43.786 --> 00:40:46.156 A:middle
So I can set the accessibility
parent using a property.

00:40:46.546 --> 00:40:48.736 A:middle
And I just set it to
myself because the parent

00:40:49.046 --> 00:40:51.396 A:middle
of a square is the board.

00:40:51.886 --> 00:40:53.726 A:middle
And then I need to
set the frame.

00:40:55.126 --> 00:40:57.636 A:middle
Typically the accessibility
frame has always been given

00:40:57.636 --> 00:40:58.826 A:middle
in screen coordinates.

00:40:58.906 --> 00:41:01.116 A:middle
And It's important for us
because that's what we use


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:40:58.906 --> 00:41:01.116 A:middle
And It's important for us
because that's what we use

00:41:01.116 --> 00:41:04.116 A:middle
to draw the VoiceOver cursor
around a particular element.

00:41:05.096 --> 00:41:07.816 A:middle
And we were thinking about this
with the new API and saying,

00:41:08.126 --> 00:41:09.896 A:middle
you know, it'd be really
cool if we could just say,

00:41:09.896 --> 00:41:12.486 A:middle
here's my frame relative
to my parent.

00:41:12.936 --> 00:41:15.656 A:middle
And then I don't have to do
any work, when the window moves

00:41:15.656 --> 00:41:16.766 A:middle
or my parent moves around,

00:41:16.766 --> 00:41:19.136 A:middle
to recalculate my
frame in screen space.

00:41:20.016 --> 00:41:21.896 A:middle
So we've added this nice
convenience property

00:41:21.896 --> 00:41:23.766 A:middle
to NSAccessibilityElement

00:41:24.476 --> 00:41:26.506 A:middle
and it's called
accessibiltyFrame InParentSpace.

00:41:26.506 --> 00:41:27.686 A:middle
It does exactly that.

00:41:28.496 --> 00:41:30.716 A:middle
I can calculate the actual rect

00:41:31.076 --> 00:41:33.216 A:middle
that I'm using during
the -- for drawing.

00:41:34.206 --> 00:41:36.516 A:middle
That's given in my parent space.

00:41:37.206 --> 00:41:39.376 A:middle
And I can set that as
the accessibilityFrame

00:41:39.376 --> 00:41:39.966 A:middle
InParentSpace.

00:41:39.966 --> 00:41:41.846 A:middle
And now whenever
something moves,

00:41:41.896 --> 00:41:45.166 A:middle
we have enough information
on our end to recalculate

00:41:45.246 --> 00:41:46.726 A:middle
where the frame is,
and you don't have

00:41:46.726 --> 00:41:47.906 A:middle
to do any of that bookkeeping.

00:41:49.926 --> 00:41:52.196 A:middle
So now that we've created
this accessibility element

00:41:52.196 --> 00:41:54.346 A:middle
for each square, we
want to make sure

00:41:54.346 --> 00:41:55.616 A:middle
that we add them
all to the array.

00:41:56.356 --> 00:41:58.936 A:middle
And then as Patti said,
you want to make sure

00:41:58.936 --> 00:42:00.396 A:middle
that you cache these elements.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:41:58.936 --> 00:42:00.396 A:middle
that you cache these elements.

00:42:00.916 --> 00:42:04.426 A:middle
So at any point in your
applications lifetime

00:42:04.636 --> 00:42:06.366 A:middle
where this item is
being drawn onscreen,

00:42:06.926 --> 00:42:10.696 A:middle
the accessibility element
representing it has to be there

00:42:10.696 --> 00:42:12.236 A:middle
for accessibility
to be able to query.

00:42:13.456 --> 00:42:17.536 A:middle
And then lastly, remember
we overrode the getter here

00:42:17.606 --> 00:42:19.796 A:middle
so we need to make sure we
actually return these children.

00:42:22.166 --> 00:42:24.316 A:middle
So with that I can go back
up to the top of my file...

00:42:24.726 --> 00:42:28.176 A:middle
and I finally just made this
really complicated UI accessible

00:42:28.426 --> 00:42:30.356 A:middle
with not too much extra work.

00:42:30.986 --> 00:42:33.446 A:middle
I see that all of my warnings
have gone away (well we didn't

00:42:33.446 --> 00:42:35.006 A:middle
have any warnings
here, for example).

00:42:35.976 --> 00:42:39.596 A:middle
But this has now added a basic
level accessibility to my app.

00:42:40.346 --> 00:42:42.756 A:middle
And so let's take a look at
what that looks like now.

00:42:48.356 --> 00:42:51.226 A:middle
And the way I'm going to
verify that my changes worked,

00:42:51.756 --> 00:42:53.376 A:middle
is by using one of the
tools Patti mentioned.

00:42:53.376 --> 00:42:54.896 A:middle
It's called Accessibility
Inspector.

00:42:55.036 --> 00:42:57.286 A:middle
And you can launch it
from the Xcode menu

00:42:58.076 --> 00:43:01.316 A:middle
under Open Developer Tool
and Accessibility Inspector.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:42:58.076 --> 00:43:01.316 A:middle
under Open Developer Tool
and Accessibility Inspector.

00:43:03.256 --> 00:43:05.676 A:middle
Again, what this does is it
shows you the accessibility

00:43:05.676 --> 00:43:08.116 A:middle
information for the
item under the mouse.

00:43:08.976 --> 00:43:12.086 A:middle
So here, there's three
sections that are showing up.

00:43:12.706 --> 00:43:15.386 A:middle
The very top is the
accessibility Hierarchy.

00:43:16.286 --> 00:43:17.576 A:middle
So if this is analogous to...

00:43:17.576 --> 00:43:18.926 A:middle
it's kind of like
the view Hierarchy.

00:43:19.366 --> 00:43:20.946 A:middle
If your accessibility
elements aren't

00:43:20.946 --> 00:43:22.856 A:middle
in the accessibility
Hierarchy, they're not going

00:43:22.856 --> 00:43:24.616 A:middle
to be available to
accessibility clients.

00:43:24.866 --> 00:43:25.866 A:middle
Much like a view that's not

00:43:25.866 --> 00:43:27.246 A:middle
in the view Hierarchy
won't be shown.

00:43:28.646 --> 00:43:30.346 A:middle
The next section
is the Attributes.

00:43:30.456 --> 00:43:32.506 A:middle
So these are all the properties
that we have now added

00:43:32.796 --> 00:43:34.216 A:middle
onto accessibility elements,

00:43:34.476 --> 00:43:36.356 A:middle
and you can see each
of their values.

00:43:37.166 --> 00:43:40.056 A:middle
And there's also some
more complicated ones

00:43:40.056 --> 00:43:41.526 A:middle
like Parameterized Attributes.

00:43:42.726 --> 00:43:44.346 A:middle
So the very first
thing that we worked

00:43:44.346 --> 00:43:45.866 A:middle
on was the "plus and minus" one.

00:43:45.936 --> 00:43:47.246 A:middle
And remember this
was to increase

00:43:47.246 --> 00:43:48.356 A:middle
and decrease the difficulty.

00:43:48.356 --> 00:43:50.106 A:middle
And we needed to just
add a label there.

00:43:50.106 --> 00:43:51.486 A:middle
It was a standard
AppKit control.

00:43:51.906 --> 00:43:57.536 A:middle
And what I can see
is that the access...

00:43:58.016 --> 00:44:01.096 A:middle
down here is showing up
as decreased difficulty.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:43:58.016 --> 00:44:01.096 A:middle
down here is showing up
as decreased difficulty.

00:44:01.096 --> 00:44:01.636 A:middle
So this is good.

00:44:01.636 --> 00:44:03.206 A:middle
And we know that this
element is now labeled.

00:44:03.206 --> 00:44:05.896 A:middle
It's going to be spoken when
it's navigated with VoiceOver.

00:44:07.186 --> 00:44:12.696 A:middle
Same thing with the
Increase difficulty button.

00:44:13.146 --> 00:44:15.366 A:middle
The label is there,
which is good.

00:44:16.316 --> 00:44:19.296 A:middle
What about the Restart
Game button?

00:44:19.476 --> 00:44:22.006 A:middle
Well remember this wasn't even
available to accessibility,

00:44:22.386 --> 00:44:24.276 A:middle
and now we see that
it's in the Hierarchy

00:44:24.276 --> 00:44:25.696 A:middle
as an accessibility button.

00:44:26.626 --> 00:44:28.676 A:middle
And it also has a label
of "Restart Game."

00:44:28.906 --> 00:44:29.456 A:middle
So this is great.

00:44:29.456 --> 00:44:31.356 A:middle
it's going to be read out
as a Restart Game button.

00:44:32.626 --> 00:44:34.666 A:middle
Similarly with a checkbox,

00:44:35.746 --> 00:44:38.096 A:middle
it's now in the view
Hierarchy (which is awesome)

00:44:38.096 --> 00:44:40.736 A:middle
so it will show up to
accessibility clients.

00:44:41.276 --> 00:44:42.466 A:middle
It says it's a checkbox.

00:44:42.466 --> 00:44:44.576 A:middle
It has a label of AI opponent.

00:44:45.876 --> 00:44:47.336 A:middle
And now the grid.

00:44:49.196 --> 00:44:50.776 A:middle
So the grid shows up as a group.

00:44:51.296 --> 00:44:53.346 A:middle
And one of the accessibility
properties is the

00:44:53.346 --> 00:44:54.346 A:middle
accessibility Children.

00:44:54.666 --> 00:44:57.336 A:middle
And we see that it has nine
items and they're all buttons.

00:44:57.336 --> 00:45:02.146 A:middle
So if you take a look at
just one button, it says it's


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:44:57.336 --> 00:45:02.146 A:middle
So if you take a look at
just one button, it says it's

00:45:02.146 --> 00:45:04.436 A:middle
in the Hierarchy, as well
as it has a label for

00:45:04.436 --> 00:45:05.746 A:middle
"it's the empty top left."

00:45:06.676 --> 00:45:08.516 A:middle
The next one says "empty top."

00:45:09.246 --> 00:45:10.026 A:middle
"Empty top right."

00:45:10.196 --> 00:45:13.366 A:middle
And you'll notice here also
there's an action section

00:45:13.366 --> 00:45:14.646 A:middle
on the bottom saying
PerformPress.

00:45:14.646 --> 00:45:17.776 A:middle
And it says, this is what this
element supports for actions.

00:45:17.936 --> 00:45:21.206 A:middle
So that's actually really great.

00:45:21.566 --> 00:45:23.656 A:middle
Okay so now that
I've audited my app

00:45:23.836 --> 00:45:26.786 A:middle
with Accessibility
Inspector, I'm fairly certain

00:45:26.786 --> 00:45:29.456 A:middle
that the accessibility I've
implemented is correct.

00:45:30.266 --> 00:45:33.446 A:middle
So now I'm going to
turn on VoiceOver;

00:45:33.446 --> 00:45:37.626 A:middle
I'm going to audit
it using VoiceOver.

00:45:37.626 --> 00:45:38.066 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on.

00:45:38.066 --> 00:45:38.806 A:middle
Tic Tac Toe.

00:45:39.196 --> 00:45:39.896 A:middle
Tic Tac Toe.

00:45:39.966 --> 00:45:41.586 A:middle
Window. AI Opponent.

00:45:41.876 --> 00:45:42.336 A:middle
Unchecked.

00:45:42.416 --> 00:45:44.006 A:middle
Checkbox has keyboard focus.

00:45:44.926 --> 00:45:46.706 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Great. So we can now
land on this element.

00:45:47.236 --> 00:45:48.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Check. AI Opponent.

00:45:48.486 --> 00:45:49.106 A:middle
Checkbox.

00:45:49.266 --> 00:45:50.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I can activate it.

00:45:50.696 --> 00:45:51.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Difficult.

00:45:51.386 --> 00:45:52.926 A:middle
Decrease difficulty, button.

00:45:53.256 --> 00:45:54.486 A:middle
Press. Press.

00:45:54.586 --> 00:45:56.606 A:middle
Press. Decrease difficulty,
button.

00:45:56.856 --> 00:45:59.146 A:middle
&gt;&gt; The buttons are labeled,
and they support the actions.

00:45:59.186 --> 00:46:00.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt;2. Increase difficulty.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:45:59.186 --> 00:46:00.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt;2. Increase difficulty.

00:46:00.046 --> 00:46:01.316 A:middle
Restart Game, button.

00:46:01.696 --> 00:46:03.746 A:middle
Press. Restart Game, button.

00:46:03.746 --> 00:46:05.006 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I can press to
restart the game

00:46:05.006 --> 00:46:06.136 A:middle
if I had the game in progress.

00:46:06.136 --> 00:46:08.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Tic Tac Toe board ,group.

00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:10.816 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I also land on
the board group.

00:46:11.156 --> 00:46:13.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Interact with Tic
Tac Toe board group.

00:46:14.006 --> 00:46:16.326 A:middle
9 items. Empty top left, button.

00:46:16.686 --> 00:46:17.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And I can move
into this group

00:46:17.976 --> 00:46:19.586 A:middle
to see the different pieces.

00:46:19.586 --> 00:46:20.726 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Empty top, button.

00:46:21.176 --> 00:46:23.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now if I place a piece there
using the Activate option.

00:46:23.906 --> 00:46:25.456 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Press X top, button.

00:46:25.886 --> 00:46:27.306 A:middle
Empty top left, button.

00:46:27.506 --> 00:46:29.316 A:middle
Press X top left, button.

00:46:30.046 --> 00:46:30.876 A:middle
VoiceOver off.

00:46:31.016 --> 00:46:32.756 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I can play a full
game of Tic Tac Toe now.

00:46:33.096 --> 00:46:35.716 A:middle
So this is really exciting,
and I hope you've seen

00:46:35.716 --> 00:46:38.876 A:middle
that with just a few lines of
code we can really walk you

00:46:38.876 --> 00:46:41.286 A:middle
through what you need to
do to add accessibility

00:46:41.366 --> 00:46:42.946 A:middle
to something like this.

00:46:43.116 --> 00:46:45.396 A:middle
And I hope you really
see that the level

00:46:45.396 --> 00:46:46.876 A:middle
of accessibility
is quite drastic.

00:46:47.306 --> 00:46:48.826 A:middle
Before, there was hardly any,

00:46:48.826 --> 00:46:50.526 A:middle
and now there's almost
full support.

00:46:51.506 --> 00:46:55.216 A:middle
So there's a couple more
things that you can do here

00:46:55.416 --> 00:46:57.466 A:middle
to make this app
even more accessible.

00:46:57.546 --> 00:46:58.856 A:middle
I'm just going to point out one.

00:46:59.736 --> 00:47:02.136 A:middle
Suppose for example that
I'm playing this game


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:46:59.736 --> 00:47:02.136 A:middle
Suppose for example that
I'm playing this game

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:04.896 A:middle
with a user who's
using VoiceOver

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:06.966 A:middle
and they're on the checkbox.

00:47:07.156 --> 00:47:08.346 A:middle
And focus is on the checkbox.

00:47:09.246 --> 00:47:12.766 A:middle
They can activate the item
using "command, option, space."

00:47:13.556 --> 00:47:16.576 A:middle
But I can also go in and click
that checkbox with my mouse.

00:47:17.206 --> 00:47:20.416 A:middle
So how does a VoiceOver user
know if I've changed the state

00:47:20.416 --> 00:47:22.536 A:middle
of something out
from underneath them?

00:47:23.456 --> 00:47:25.056 A:middle
Well we've solved
this problem using

00:47:25.056 --> 00:47:26.686 A:middle
Accessibility Notifications.

00:47:26.766 --> 00:47:28.196 A:middle
And there's always been
some questions about,

00:47:28.626 --> 00:47:29.996 A:middle
"which ones do I use?

00:47:29.996 --> 00:47:31.056 A:middle
When do I use them?"

00:47:31.576 --> 00:47:32.676 A:middle
And we really tried to answer

00:47:32.676 --> 00:47:34.956 A:middle
that with the new
protocols file.

00:47:35.386 --> 00:47:37.216 A:middle
So again, this is
your one-stop-shop,

00:47:37.216 --> 00:47:38.586 A:middle
and you can really
go back there.

00:47:39.396 --> 00:47:43.036 A:middle
Here in the checkbox protocol
declaration, there's a comment

00:47:43.106 --> 00:47:45.486 A:middle
which tells me about the
notifications I need to post.

00:47:46.106 --> 00:47:47.176 A:middle
So in this case it says,

00:47:47.636 --> 00:47:50.546 A:middle
"the AccessibilityValueChanged
Notification needs

00:47:50.546 --> 00:47:53.046 A:middle
to be posted whenever
accessibilityValue changes."

00:47:53.446 --> 00:47:56.056 A:middle
Recall that's the checked
or unchecked state.

00:47:56.706 --> 00:47:58.666 A:middle
So if at any point it
changes for any reason,

00:47:59.106 --> 00:48:01.006 A:middle
I need to send this
notification.


WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:47:59.106 --> 00:48:01.006 A:middle
I need to send this
notification.

00:48:01.346 --> 00:48:02.466 A:middle
And it's really easy to do.

00:48:02.466 --> 00:48:04.566 A:middle
So I'm going to go back
to my checkbox view.

00:48:05.346 --> 00:48:07.996 A:middle
And if you recall, we had
the toggleCheckedState

00:48:07.996 --> 00:48:09.576 A:middle
and this is what got activated

00:48:09.576 --> 00:48:12.256 A:middle
when you used the
AccessibilityActivate action.

00:48:12.966 --> 00:48:14.876 A:middle
And here's where I need
to post that notification.

00:48:15.396 --> 00:48:19.186 A:middle
So I can do that with
NSAccessibility PostNotificaton.

00:48:19.916 --> 00:48:22.186 A:middle
The element this notification
should be associated

00:48:22.186 --> 00:48:23.696 A:middle
with is the checkbox itself.

00:48:24.256 --> 00:48:27.346 A:middle
And then the notification
type is an NSAccessibility

00:48:27.766 --> 00:48:29.646 A:middle
ValueChangedNotification.

00:48:30.626 --> 00:48:30.876 A:middle
That's it.

00:48:32.366 --> 00:48:35.726 A:middle
So again, some of the more
advanced accessibility items now

00:48:36.036 --> 00:48:38.056 A:middle
don't actually take that
much more code either.

00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:41.236 A:middle
And so now if you were
to run this app again,

00:48:41.516 --> 00:48:43.186 A:middle
and you were collaborating
with the VoiceOver user,

00:48:43.186 --> 00:48:45.066 A:middle
and you clicked that button
they would now be announced --

00:48:45.066 --> 00:48:46.826 A:middle
ah, the new state would
now be announced to them.

00:48:47.986 --> 00:48:49.566 A:middle
So that's the end of the demo.

00:48:50.316 --> 00:48:52.716 A:middle
And I hope what you've seen
is that we've tried to make it

00:48:52.916 --> 00:48:55.176 A:middle
as easy as possible for you

00:48:56.236 --> 00:48:58.886 A:middle
to add accessibility
with our new API.

00:49:00.016 --> 00:49:05.016 A:middle
I should also mention that
we have a sample app --

00:49:05.016 --> 00:49:06.106 A:middle
you may have seen
this in the past --

00:49:06.106 --> 00:49:08.496 A:middle
we call it Accessibility
UIExamples.

00:49:08.956 --> 00:49:10.996 A:middle
And what it is, is a collection

00:49:10.996 --> 00:49:12.736 A:middle
of all different
types of elements.

00:49:12.886 --> 00:49:16.326 A:middle
So here there's a
button, text, images.

00:49:16.526 --> 00:49:19.636 A:middle
We also have more complicated
UI like layout areas,

00:49:19.846 --> 00:49:22.196 A:middle
collapsible outline
views, table views.

00:49:22.706 --> 00:49:25.056 A:middle
And what we've done
is implemented each

00:49:25.056 --> 00:49:26.456 A:middle
of these using different
methods.

00:49:26.606 --> 00:49:30.226 A:middle
So for example, subclassing
from standard AppKit controls,

00:49:30.476 --> 00:49:35.046 A:middle
making it a subclass of NSView,
but also OpenGL CALayers --

00:49:35.046 --> 00:49:36.366 A:middle
we have examples
for all of those.

00:49:37.056 --> 00:49:39.556 A:middle
And for this release we've
gone through, we've ripped

00:49:39.556 --> 00:49:40.966 A:middle
out the accessibility
that we had,

00:49:41.306 --> 00:49:43.366 A:middle
and added it right back
in with the new API.

00:49:43.366 --> 00:49:47.556 A:middle
And what we found was a
drastic code savings: many,

00:49:47.596 --> 00:49:48.626 A:middle
many fewer lines of code.

00:49:48.626 --> 00:49:52.156 A:middle
And what we hope to do
is have this available

00:49:52.496 --> 00:49:53.346 A:middle
as a reference for you.

00:49:53.346 --> 00:49:55.486 A:middle
Say "hey, I want to learn
how to use this protocol,"

00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:56.676 A:middle
you have an example

00:49:56.676 --> 00:49:58.406 A:middle
in a concrete implementation
that we've done.

00:49:58.956 --> 00:50:01.556 A:middle
This is available, along
with the Tic Tac Toe app,

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

00:49:58.956 --> 00:50:01.556 A:middle
This is available, along
with the Tic Tac Toe app,

00:50:01.556 --> 00:50:03.686 A:middle
on developer.apple.com today.

00:50:04.246 --> 00:50:05.136 A:middle
Please go check it out.

00:50:05.256 --> 00:50:05.926 A:middle
Download it.

00:50:06.076 --> 00:50:09.856 A:middle
We also have, in this particular
example, a nice readme file

00:50:09.856 --> 00:50:11.776 A:middle
that has kind of a
developer quickstart

00:50:11.776 --> 00:50:12.826 A:middle
on how to use our API.

00:50:16.276 --> 00:50:19.816 A:middle
So with that, in summary,
we really took this release

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:22.426 A:middle
to think about "how
could we make it easier

00:50:22.936 --> 00:50:24.766 A:middle
to add accessibility
to your application?"

00:50:25.386 --> 00:50:27.986 A:middle
What we came away
with was a brand new,

00:50:28.356 --> 00:50:30.016 A:middle
really easy-to-use API.

00:50:31.086 --> 00:50:33.086 A:middle
And it's really easy
to use because all

00:50:33.086 --> 00:50:35.656 A:middle
of the accessibility
attributes are now properties

00:50:35.656 --> 00:50:36.386 A:middle
on the objects.

00:50:36.466 --> 00:50:37.766 A:middle
So they're really easy to set.

00:50:37.996 --> 00:50:41.086 A:middle
We also have the accessibility
protocols, which guide you

00:50:41.086 --> 00:50:44.516 A:middle
through the items that you
need to implement in order

00:50:44.516 --> 00:50:46.606 A:middle
to make your custom
UI accessible.

00:50:47.216 --> 00:50:50.296 A:middle
And then lastly we formalize
the faux UI element class

00:50:50.636 --> 00:50:52.216 A:middle
into NSAccessibility Element.

00:50:52.456 --> 00:50:55.646 A:middle
And it's there for you to be
an accessibility backing object

00:50:55.946 --> 00:50:59.586 A:middle
when there's no UI view for
it, or NSView backing it.

00:51:00.206 --> 00:51:02.216 A:middle
We'd like to encourage you
to test with VoiceOver.

00:51:02.216 --> 00:51:05.356 A:middle
It ships with every Mac and
it's a great way for you

00:51:05.356 --> 00:51:08.296 A:middle
to see what our customers
are going to experience using

00:51:08.296 --> 00:51:10.756 A:middle
that assistive technology
with your application.

00:51:11.396 --> 00:51:14.256 A:middle
If you'd like to just kind
of debug a little bit more,

00:51:14.546 --> 00:51:16.796 A:middle
we have Accessibility
Inspector there to really get

00:51:16.796 --> 00:51:20.106 A:middle
in at what exactly is going on
with your accessibility element.

00:51:21.156 --> 00:51:23.296 A:middle
And lastly, we wanted
to support you

00:51:23.296 --> 00:51:24.716 A:middle
in this transition
to the new API.

00:51:24.716 --> 00:51:27.406 A:middle
And we really want to
encourage you to use it.

00:51:27.976 --> 00:51:30.456 A:middle
And so we've built up these
really great developer examples

00:51:30.456 --> 00:51:33.936 A:middle
that we've now released, and we
hope you can use as a reference

00:51:34.176 --> 00:51:35.756 A:middle
for your implementation.

00:51:36.356 --> 00:51:40.336 A:middle

If you liked this session, and
you're interested in finding

00:52:01.586 --> 00:52:04.236 A:middle
out how accessibility works
on our other platforms,

00:52:04.676 --> 00:52:07.806 A:middle
there's an "Accessibility on
iOS" session in this room,

00:52:07.856 --> 00:52:09.156 A:middle
right after this presentation.

00:52:09.776 --> 00:52:12.736 A:middle
And then a Web Accessibility
presentation

00:52:13.016 --> 00:52:14.486 A:middle
on Friday at 9:00 am.

00:52:15.196 --> 00:52:16.806 A:middle
Thank you so much for
coming to our session.

00:52:16.806 --> 00:52:18.186 A:middle
We really appreciate
you being here.

00:52:18.556 --> 00:52:19.756 A:middle
And from all of us at Apple,

00:52:19.906 --> 00:52:21.176 A:middle
we hope you have a
fantastic rest of WWDC.

00:52:21.176 --> 00:52:21.646 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:52:21.646 --> 00:52:22.686 A:middle
[1]Cannot tell if
speaker is saying

00:52:22.936 --> 00:52:23.986 A:middle
"accessibility compiler"
or "-Xcompiler".

00:52:24.016 --> 00:52:24.856 A:middle
[2]I think she's
saying "forUIElement".
