[ Applause ]

00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:32.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Privacy is about people.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.686 A:middle
My name is Joey Tyson.

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:37.286 A:middle
I'm a privacy engineer at Apple,

00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:39.336 A:middle
and I know you've heard a lot of

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:40.876 A:middle
great information this week on

00:00:40.876 --> 00:00:43.066 A:middle
exciting new features and you're

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.506 A:middle
ready to get out there and build

00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:47.066 A:middle
some new apps, but I know you

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.206 A:middle
also care deeply about your

00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:50.246 A:middle
user's privacy.

00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:53.806 A:middle
And this is the first of three

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:56.366 A:middle
big ideas I want to explore with

00:00:56.426 --> 00:00:58.676 A:middle
you about privacy today before

00:00:58.676 --> 00:01:00.216 A:middle
we get into this year's updates.


00:00:58.676 --> 00:01:00.216 A:middle
we get into this year's updates.

00:01:01.446 --> 00:01:02.236 A:middle
Because we're going to talk a

00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:05.536 A:middle
lot about data privacy, but we

00:01:05.536 --> 00:01:07.716 A:middle
can never forget that data is

00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:08.996 A:middle
about people.

00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:11.196 A:middle
It belongs to them.

00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:14.616 A:middle
So when I say that privacy is

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:16.896 A:middle
about people, I mean it's about

00:01:16.896 --> 00:01:19.166 A:middle
building a relationship of trust

00:01:19.556 --> 00:01:20.586 A:middle
with your users.

00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:24.096 A:middle
This lays a foundation for

00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:26.206 A:middle
better engagement, which leads

00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:27.046 A:middle
to better apps.

00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:29.826 A:middle
Think about other relationships.

00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:31.596 A:middle
It's the people that you trust

00:01:32.086 --> 00:01:33.676 A:middle
that you're more likely to work

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:35.056 A:middle
with and spend time with.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:40.076 A:middle
And as your users understand why

00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:41.636 A:middle
you're collecting data, how it's

00:01:41.696 --> 00:01:44.256 A:middle
being used, as you handle that

00:01:44.256 --> 00:01:45.716 A:middle
data respectfully and

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:47.946 A:middle
thoughtfully, you're going to

00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:50.416 A:middle
get better data, because they're

00:01:50.416 --> 00:01:51.506 A:middle
going to be more comfortable

00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:54.076 A:middle
using your apps and sharing

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:56.006 A:middle
information, and this builds

00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:57.316 A:middle
loyalty over time.

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:02.446 A:middle
And I start here because I want


00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:02.446 A:middle
And I start here because I want

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:04.676 A:middle
you to apply this context to

00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:06.596 A:middle
your development process.

00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:09.816 A:middle
None of us do engineering in

00:02:09.886 --> 00:02:12.746 A:middle
isolation, so whether you're

00:02:12.746 --> 00:02:15.056 A:middle
working with health records or

00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:16.266 A:middle
just building a simple puzzle

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:19.136 A:middle
game, the information you gather

00:02:19.336 --> 00:02:21.096 A:middle
and the ways that you use it

00:02:21.736 --> 00:02:23.896 A:middle
could have a very real impact on

00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:24.956 A:middle
people's lives.

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:28.186 A:middle
So it's critical for each of us

00:02:28.486 --> 00:02:29.846 A:middle
to think carefully about the

00:02:29.846 --> 00:02:30.856 A:middle
technologies that we're

00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:31.486 A:middle
building.

00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:34.956 A:middle
In a recent commencement address

00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:37.556 A:middle
at Duke University, Tim Cook

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:39.136 A:middle
talked about Apple's approach to

00:02:39.136 --> 00:02:41.846 A:middle
privacy, and he said that "In

00:02:41.846 --> 00:02:44.196 A:middle
every way, at every turn, the

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:46.646 A:middle
question we ask ourselves is not

00:02:46.646 --> 00:02:49.906 A:middle
what can we do, but what should

00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:50.396 A:middle
we do."

00:02:50.896 --> 00:02:54.566 A:middle
And that leads me to the second

00:02:54.896 --> 00:02:58.606 A:middle
big idea, ask the "should"

00:02:58.826 --> 00:02:59.696 A:middle
questions.


00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:03.306 A:middle
No matter what your role,

00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:05.006 A:middle
whether you're a solo app

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:06.656 A:middle
developer or part of a large

00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:09.606 A:middle
organization, you can be the one

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:12.016 A:middle
to stand up for your users.

00:03:12.476 --> 00:03:14.016 A:middle
Remember your responsibility

00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:16.536 A:middle
towards them, and ask questions

00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:18.286 A:middle
about the data flows in your

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:19.346 A:middle
app.

00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:23.646 A:middle
For example, why do we actually

00:03:23.646 --> 00:03:24.296 A:middle
need this data?

00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:27.256 A:middle
This isn't merely an accusation.

00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:28.606 A:middle
It's to think about is this

00:03:28.606 --> 00:03:31.236 A:middle
necessary for our use case?

00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:32.836 A:middle
Should we collect it?

00:03:34.176 --> 00:03:36.196 A:middle
Would this surprise our users?

00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:38.876 A:middle
If people understood this and it

00:03:38.876 --> 00:03:41.076 A:middle
scared them, why should we be

00:03:41.076 --> 00:03:41.916 A:middle
doing it at all?

00:03:43.116 --> 00:03:45.226 A:middle
Could we use less granular data,

00:03:45.226 --> 00:03:46.476 A:middle
less precise?

00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:48.656 A:middle
Are there other approaches we

00:03:48.656 --> 00:03:49.466 A:middle
should consider?

00:03:50.616 --> 00:03:52.316 A:middle
And should we delete or

00:03:52.316 --> 00:03:53.876 A:middle
aggregate this data after a

00:03:53.876 --> 00:03:54.766 A:middle
period of time?

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:58.046 A:middle
Part of the reason for asking

00:03:58.046 --> 00:03:59.646 A:middle
these kinds of questions is that

00:03:59.646 --> 00:04:01.436 A:middle
we can all fall prey to


00:03:59.646 --> 00:04:01.436 A:middle
we can all fall prey to

00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:03.326 A:middle
assumptions about our data.

00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:06.946 A:middle
So just thinking, we should just

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:07.976 A:middle
log this for everyone.

00:04:09.036 --> 00:04:10.156 A:middle
Maybe that's the way we've

00:04:10.156 --> 00:04:12.526 A:middle
always done it in the past or

00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:14.306 A:middle
the way others do it, but again,

00:04:14.306 --> 00:04:15.726 A:middle
is it really necessary for what

00:04:15.726 --> 00:04:16.966 A:middle
we're trying to accomplish?

00:04:19.516 --> 00:04:21.065 A:middle
Or you might think that data

00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:22.696 A:middle
couldn't possibly be sensitive

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:24.046 A:middle
in the context you're working,

00:04:24.046 --> 00:04:26.656 A:middle
but maybe that data is very

00:04:26.656 --> 00:04:28.506 A:middle
sensitive in a different context

00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:30.316 A:middle
or for users in a vulnerable

00:04:30.316 --> 00:04:30.976 A:middle
population.

00:04:33.026 --> 00:04:34.446 A:middle
If you're taking data that was

00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:35.956 A:middle
gathered for one purpose and

00:04:35.956 --> 00:04:38.196 A:middle
apply it in a new way, would

00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:41.126 A:middle
users understand or expect that?

00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:44.096 A:middle
You also hear people talk about

00:04:44.096 --> 00:04:45.376 A:middle
personally identifiable

00:04:45.376 --> 00:04:48.436 A:middle
information, or PII, but even

00:04:48.436 --> 00:04:49.996 A:middle
data that falls outside that

00:04:49.996 --> 00:04:51.306 A:middle
definition can still have a

00:04:51.306 --> 00:04:52.416 A:middle
privacy impact.

00:04:53.896 --> 00:04:55.926 A:middle
Just like if you're protecting

00:04:55.926 --> 00:04:57.226 A:middle
data with encryption and good

00:04:57.226 --> 00:04:59.876 A:middle
security, that's wonderful, but

00:04:59.876 --> 00:05:01.796 A:middle
privacy is so much more than


00:04:59.876 --> 00:05:01.796 A:middle
privacy is so much more than

00:05:01.796 --> 00:05:02.106 A:middle
that.

00:05:03.096 --> 00:05:04.276 A:middle
Because this again doesn't get

00:05:04.276 --> 00:05:06.306 A:middle
back to the should questions of

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.116 A:middle
should we even have this data at

00:05:08.116 --> 00:05:08.596 A:middle
all.

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:11.926 A:middle
Now as you're asking questions

00:05:11.926 --> 00:05:13.146 A:middle
about the data flows in your

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.576 A:middle
app, if you want to even go one

00:05:14.576 --> 00:05:16.726 A:middle
step further, you can create

00:05:16.726 --> 00:05:18.376 A:middle
privacy guarantees.

00:05:19.436 --> 00:05:20.936 A:middle
These are high-level statements

00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:22.646 A:middle
about the privacy expectations

00:05:22.646 --> 00:05:24.226 A:middle
in your app that you want to be

00:05:24.226 --> 00:05:24.766 A:middle
able to make.

00:05:25.946 --> 00:05:27.986 A:middle
And by establishing these early

00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:29.886 A:middle
on in the development process,

00:05:30.676 --> 00:05:32.396 A:middle
it provides a framework to guide

00:05:32.396 --> 00:05:33.316 A:middle
you as you're building your

00:05:33.316 --> 00:05:35.216 A:middle
features and something to test

00:05:35.216 --> 00:05:36.926 A:middle
against once you're done.

00:05:38.416 --> 00:05:39.966 A:middle
There's some examples on the

00:05:39.966 --> 00:05:41.256 A:middle
screen here of these kinds of

00:05:41.256 --> 00:05:42.326 A:middle
statements that are similar to

00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:44.416 A:middle
statements Apple has made about

00:05:44.416 --> 00:05:46.436 A:middle
some of our features, and

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.866 A:middle
there's many options for

00:05:48.946 --> 00:05:50.436 A:middle
implementing each of these,

00:05:51.586 --> 00:05:54.516 A:middle
which brings me to the third big

00:05:54.516 --> 00:05:54.946 A:middle
idea.

00:05:56.166 --> 00:05:58.956 A:middle
Align your data practices with

00:05:59.036 --> 00:06:00.216 A:middle
your use cases.


00:05:59.036 --> 00:06:00.216 A:middle
your use cases.

00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:04.166 A:middle
To illustrate this, let's think

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:05.886 A:middle
of data collection, the amount

00:06:05.886 --> 00:06:06.986 A:middle
and types of data that you

00:06:06.986 --> 00:06:07.536 A:middle
gather.

00:06:07.996 --> 00:06:09.846 A:middle
We mentioned earlier those

00:06:09.846 --> 00:06:10.576 A:middle
assumptions.

00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:11.856 A:middle
You know, you may think

00:06:11.856 --> 00:06:13.366 A:middle
sometimes well shouldn't I just

00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:15.376 A:middle
gather as much data as possible?

00:06:15.376 --> 00:06:17.706 A:middle
Well, you know, in the past you

00:06:17.706 --> 00:06:18.856 A:middle
may have hear people call data

00:06:18.856 --> 00:06:20.526 A:middle
the fuel of the new economy.

00:06:21.066 --> 00:06:24.416 A:middle
Like actual fuel, data should be

00:06:24.416 --> 00:06:25.726 A:middle
handled with caution.

00:06:27.316 --> 00:06:29.606 A:middle
Because data is very powerful,

00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:30.796 A:middle
and that unlocks a lot of great

00:06:30.796 --> 00:06:32.866 A:middle
use cases, but because it's so

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:34.576 A:middle
powerful, it can also be

00:06:34.576 --> 00:06:36.596 A:middle
dangerous if not handled

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:37.166 A:middle
carefully.

00:06:38.756 --> 00:06:40.926 A:middle
Gathering data creates overhead

00:06:40.926 --> 00:06:41.636 A:middle
for you as an engineer.

00:06:41.636 --> 00:06:43.806 A:middle
You're going to need to spend

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:46.596 A:middle
time and resources managing that

00:06:46.596 --> 00:06:47.696 A:middle
data, keeping up with it,

00:06:47.696 --> 00:06:48.376 A:middle
filtering it.

00:06:48.476 --> 00:06:49.746 A:middle
It's time you could be spending

00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:51.506 A:middle
working on new features for your

00:06:51.506 --> 00:06:52.126 A:middle
users.

00:06:53.156 --> 00:06:55.316 A:middle
It also creates liabilities.

00:06:56.096 --> 00:06:57.376 A:middle
We've all heard about companies

00:06:57.376 --> 00:06:58.766 A:middle
suffering data breaches, which

00:06:58.766 --> 00:06:59.966 A:middle
is a bad situation.


00:07:00.836 --> 00:07:02.166 A:middle
But if the data that gets leaked

00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:03.876 A:middle
includes information that's not

00:07:03.926 --> 00:07:06.626 A:middle
relevant to the use case, that's

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:08.456 A:middle
an even worse situation.

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:11.286 A:middle
Unexpected data collection

00:07:11.626 --> 00:07:13.536 A:middle
creates all sorts of risks.

00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:15.846 A:middle
And it destroys that foundation

00:07:15.846 --> 00:07:17.666 A:middle
of trust with your users.

00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:20.086 A:middle
The next time you think about

00:07:20.286 --> 00:07:21.386 A:middle
gathering as much data as

00:07:21.386 --> 00:07:23.926 A:middle
possible, I want you to picture

00:07:23.926 --> 00:07:26.236 A:middle
these tanks of chemicals and

00:07:26.236 --> 00:07:27.816 A:middle
remember your responsibility to

00:07:27.816 --> 00:07:30.036 A:middle
your users to handle their data

00:07:30.586 --> 00:07:32.306 A:middle
carefully and thoughtfully.

00:07:32.306 --> 00:07:34.726 A:middle
Instead, you want to practice

00:07:35.346 --> 00:07:38.206 A:middle
what we call proportional data

00:07:38.206 --> 00:07:38.686 A:middle
collection.

00:07:39.236 --> 00:07:41.396 A:middle
This is the idea of collecting

00:07:41.396 --> 00:07:43.246 A:middle
only what's necessary to achieve

00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:45.196 A:middle
your goal, and again sometimes

00:07:45.196 --> 00:07:46.326 A:middle
you might start off thinking

00:07:46.326 --> 00:07:47.186 A:middle
that you need a lot of

00:07:47.186 --> 00:07:49.006 A:middle
information when a different

00:07:49.006 --> 00:07:50.106 A:middle
dataset may suffice.

00:07:50.106 --> 00:07:52.366 A:middle
You can even start with the

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:53.946 A:middle
assumption of no data and figure

00:07:53.946 --> 00:07:55.726 A:middle
out what's actually necessary

00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:56.936 A:middle
for what you're trying to solve.

00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:00.006 A:middle
This gets back to user


00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:00.006 A:middle
This gets back to user

00:08:00.006 --> 00:08:01.116 A:middle
expectations.

00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:04.286 A:middle
People should understand why

00:08:04.286 --> 00:08:05.676 A:middle
you're collecting data and how

00:08:05.676 --> 00:08:06.446 A:middle
you're using it.

00:08:06.896 --> 00:08:07.986 A:middle
It should be in line with what

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:08.566 A:middle
they expect.

00:08:09.716 --> 00:08:10.656 A:middle
You should always be able to

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:13.206 A:middle
provide a clear rationale for

00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:14.296 A:middle
the use cases that you're

00:08:14.296 --> 00:08:14.816 A:middle
building.

00:08:15.226 --> 00:08:18.356 A:middle
But of course, this is about

00:08:18.356 --> 00:08:19.486 A:middle
data collection, but when we

00:08:19.486 --> 00:08:20.746 A:middle
talk about aligning data

00:08:20.746 --> 00:08:22.866 A:middle
practices with use cases, that

00:08:22.866 --> 00:08:24.596 A:middle
extends to the entire data life

00:08:24.596 --> 00:08:27.036 A:middle
cycle and being good stewards of

00:08:27.036 --> 00:08:28.376 A:middle
the information that's been

00:08:28.376 --> 00:08:29.296 A:middle
entrusted to you.

00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:32.426 A:middle
So even beyond just proportional

00:08:32.426 --> 00:08:33.796 A:middle
data collection, you want to

00:08:33.796 --> 00:08:35.265 A:middle
develop and use privacy

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:38.226 A:middle
techniques throughout your app's

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:38.806 A:middle
workflow.

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:41.626 A:middle
You could develop a whole

00:08:41.626 --> 00:08:43.686 A:middle
toolbox or repertoire of

00:08:43.686 --> 00:08:45.466 A:middle
techniques that will help you

00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:47.026 A:middle
build privacy into your app.

00:08:47.796 --> 00:08:49.546 A:middle
Things like aggregation,

00:08:50.386 --> 00:08:52.426 A:middle
providing transparency to users,

00:08:53.126 --> 00:08:54.806 A:middle
using a scoped identifier

00:08:54.806 --> 00:08:56.256 A:middle
instead of a real identity,

00:08:56.756 --> 00:08:58.336 A:middle
automatically rotating those

00:08:58.336 --> 00:08:58.926 A:middle
with time.

00:08:59.966 --> 00:09:01.366 A:middle
Even more advanced techniques


00:08:59.966 --> 00:09:01.366 A:middle
Even more advanced techniques

00:09:01.366 --> 00:09:02.646 A:middle
like differential privacy.

00:09:03.396 --> 00:09:05.166 A:middle
I don't have time today to go

00:09:05.166 --> 00:09:06.396 A:middle
into the entire list of

00:09:06.396 --> 00:09:08.476 A:middle
techniques available, but what I

00:09:08.476 --> 00:09:10.116 A:middle
want to focus on now is the idea

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:12.396 A:middle
of adjusting these to match your

00:09:12.396 --> 00:09:13.216 A:middle
use case.

00:09:14.636 --> 00:09:15.986 A:middle
You can think of a mixing board

00:09:15.986 --> 00:09:16.676 A:middle
for music.

00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:18.556 A:middle
If you have one track that's

00:09:18.556 --> 00:09:20.696 A:middle
particularly loud or soft, you

00:09:20.696 --> 00:09:22.366 A:middle
may need to adjust others to

00:09:22.366 --> 00:09:23.956 A:middle
balance things out and achieve a

00:09:23.956 --> 00:09:24.686 A:middle
good mix.

00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:27.686 A:middle
And again, there will be times

00:09:27.686 --> 00:09:29.026 A:middle
when you do need to collect a

00:09:29.056 --> 00:09:30.626 A:middle
lot of data for a particular

00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:32.986 A:middle
feature, but in those cases, you

00:09:33.236 --> 00:09:34.636 A:middle
want to make sure you adjust

00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:36.946 A:middle
those privacy techniques to

00:09:36.946 --> 00:09:38.396 A:middle
create a great experience for

00:09:38.396 --> 00:09:39.156 A:middle
your users.

00:09:40.416 --> 00:09:42.456 A:middle
Ideally, these apply across all

00:09:42.456 --> 00:09:44.086 A:middle
systems where the data lives so

00:09:44.086 --> 00:09:45.626 A:middle
those privacy guarantees stay

00:09:45.626 --> 00:09:47.796 A:middle
consistent and are billed as

00:09:47.866 --> 00:09:49.276 A:middle
technical enforcement rather

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:50.526 A:middle
than just policy statements

00:09:50.526 --> 00:09:52.396 A:middle
about what you plan to do.

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.316 A:middle
But I know this can all be a

00:09:55.316 --> 00:09:56.996 A:middle
little abstract, so to

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:58.766 A:middle
illustrate further, I want to

00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:00.096 A:middle
share some features that Apple


00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:00.096 A:middle
share some features that Apple

00:10:00.096 --> 00:10:01.366 A:middle
has built where we've this kind

00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:01.976 A:middle
of thinking.

00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:05.146 A:middle
First is activity sharing where

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.466 A:middle
you can share fitness data with

00:10:06.466 --> 00:10:07.176 A:middle
your friends.

00:10:08.206 --> 00:10:09.376 A:middle
Now for me as a privacy

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:11.246 A:middle
engineer, I like to turn all of

00:10:11.246 --> 00:10:12.856 A:middle
these sliders up to 100 percent

00:10:12.856 --> 00:10:15.106 A:middle
as much as possible, but that's

00:10:15.106 --> 00:10:16.426 A:middle
not always feasible for a given

00:10:16.426 --> 00:10:16.946 A:middle
feature.

00:10:17.406 --> 00:10:18.956 A:middle
In this case, you're sharing

00:10:18.956 --> 00:10:21.186 A:middle
data with friends, so they know

00:10:21.186 --> 00:10:21.626 A:middle
your name.

00:10:21.626 --> 00:10:22.646 A:middle
They know whose data it is.

00:10:23.676 --> 00:10:24.906 A:middle
So you can't just make this data

00:10:24.906 --> 00:10:25.846 A:middle
de-identified.

00:10:25.906 --> 00:10:27.636 A:middle
It's already very identifiable

00:10:27.636 --> 00:10:28.706 A:middle
as part of the use case.

00:10:29.646 --> 00:10:31.556 A:middle
Consequently, we turn up other

00:10:31.556 --> 00:10:32.976 A:middle
privacy techniques like only

00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:34.326 A:middle
showing a summary of the data,

00:10:34.746 --> 00:10:36.236 A:middle
not minute-by-minute statistics

00:10:36.296 --> 00:10:37.756 A:middle
or the exact location of your

00:10:38.396 --> 00:10:38.716 A:middle
run.

00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:40.176 A:middle
We also provide a lot of control

00:10:40.176 --> 00:10:41.536 A:middle
over who you share with and

00:10:41.536 --> 00:10:41.906 A:middle
when.

00:10:43.166 --> 00:10:45.716 A:middle
Now, in the Apple News app, we

00:10:45.716 --> 00:10:47.496 A:middle
collect analytics data using a

00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:49.126 A:middle
scoped identifier that's not

00:10:49.126 --> 00:10:50.816 A:middle
connected to your Apple ID.

00:10:51.766 --> 00:10:53.246 A:middle
That gives us more flexibility

00:10:53.246 --> 00:10:54.486 A:middle
around the precision of data we

00:10:54.486 --> 00:10:56.666 A:middle
collect, but since it's still

00:10:56.666 --> 00:10:58.006 A:middle
sensitive information, we still

00:10:58.006 --> 00:10:59.416 A:middle
provide control through things

00:10:59.416 --> 00:11:00.896 A:middle
like being able to reset that


00:10:59.416 --> 00:11:00.896 A:middle
like being able to reset that

00:11:00.896 --> 00:11:02.296 A:middle
identifier at any time.

00:11:03.516 --> 00:11:05.456 A:middle
Finally, there's photo memories.

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:06.516 A:middle
You may have seen these on your

00:11:06.516 --> 00:11:07.126 A:middle
device.

00:11:08.086 --> 00:11:10.346 A:middle
These use facial recognition

00:11:10.346 --> 00:11:11.946 A:middle
data to identify people in

00:11:11.946 --> 00:11:12.616 A:middle
pictures.

00:11:13.696 --> 00:11:15.266 A:middle
It also uses precise location

00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:16.816 A:middle
information to connect similar

00:11:16.816 --> 00:11:17.596 A:middle
photos together.

00:11:18.686 --> 00:11:20.776 A:middle
Now that's very sensitive data.

00:11:21.856 --> 00:11:23.466 A:middle
So consequently, there's another

00:11:23.466 --> 00:11:24.846 A:middle
privacy technique we turn way

00:11:24.846 --> 00:11:25.056 A:middle
up.

00:11:26.146 --> 00:11:27.366 A:middle
All the processing to build

00:11:27.366 --> 00:11:29.416 A:middle
these memories happens on your

00:11:29.416 --> 00:11:30.036 A:middle
device.

00:11:30.806 --> 00:11:31.976 A:middle
And by the way, that's a great

00:11:31.976 --> 00:11:33.776 A:middle
tool for your toolbox to do

00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:34.866 A:middle
processing locally.

00:11:35.396 --> 00:11:39.196 A:middle
So to recap, three big ideas.

00:11:39.856 --> 00:11:43.706 A:middle
Privacy is about people, ask the

00:11:43.706 --> 00:11:46.386 A:middle
"should" questions, and align

00:11:46.386 --> 00:11:48.596 A:middle
your data practices with your

00:11:48.596 --> 00:11:49.496 A:middle
use cases.

00:11:51.256 --> 00:11:52.816 A:middle
In the time we have remaining, I

00:11:52.816 --> 00:11:53.996 A:middle
want to talk through some

00:11:53.996 --> 00:11:55.136 A:middle
features and tools that are

00:11:55.136 --> 00:11:56.856 A:middle
available to you as developers

00:11:56.856 --> 00:11:58.746 A:middle
to help you build privacy in

00:11:58.746 --> 00:12:00.046 A:middle
your app.


00:11:58.746 --> 00:12:00.046 A:middle
your app.

00:12:00.546 --> 00:12:02.216 A:middle
And these fall into two general

00:12:02.216 --> 00:12:03.866 A:middle
categories of accessing user

00:12:03.866 --> 00:12:05.986 A:middle
data and more broadly, data

00:12:05.986 --> 00:12:06.656 A:middle
stewardship.

00:12:07.896 --> 00:12:09.776 A:middle
So for data access, let's start

00:12:09.826 --> 00:12:12.336 A:middle
by talking about iOS, and much

00:12:12.336 --> 00:12:13.656 A:middle
of this guidance will apply to

00:12:13.656 --> 00:12:15.666 A:middle
tvOS and watchOS as well.

00:12:16.186 --> 00:12:18.576 A:middle
Let's imagine you're building a

00:12:18.576 --> 00:12:20.266 A:middle
game for iOS where players can

00:12:20.266 --> 00:12:21.916 A:middle
compete against each other, and

00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:22.746 A:middle
you want them to be able to

00:12:22.746 --> 00:12:24.256 A:middle
upload a photo to identify

00:12:24.256 --> 00:12:24.896 A:middle
themselves.

00:12:25.816 --> 00:12:26.716 A:middle
Now we've all seen those

00:12:26.756 --> 00:12:28.276 A:middle
permission prompts for access to

00:12:28.276 --> 00:12:30.386 A:middle
photos, but wouldn't it be great

00:12:30.386 --> 00:12:31.416 A:middle
if we could just have the user

00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:32.906 A:middle
click a button, select a

00:12:32.906 --> 00:12:34.436 A:middle
picture, and have it appear

00:12:34.436 --> 00:12:36.646 A:middle
immediately in their app?

00:12:37.276 --> 00:12:39.006 A:middle
Well, you can already do this

00:12:39.006 --> 00:12:39.396 A:middle
today.

00:12:40.786 --> 00:12:41.796 A:middle
Because we have a feature

00:12:41.796 --> 00:12:43.366 A:middle
available called out-of-process

00:12:43.366 --> 00:12:45.056 A:middle
pickers for contacts, camera,

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:47.646 A:middle
and photos data, where the

00:12:47.646 --> 00:12:49.356 A:middle
picker that appears runs outside

00:12:49.356 --> 00:12:51.476 A:middle
your apps process so the only

00:12:51.476 --> 00:12:52.786 A:middle
information that's shared back

00:12:52.786 --> 00:12:54.396 A:middle
with the app is what the user

00:12:54.396 --> 00:12:55.096 A:middle
selects.

00:12:56.196 --> 00:12:57.916 A:middle
We talked about those privacy

00:12:57.916 --> 00:12:58.516 A:middle
techniques.

00:12:58.516 --> 00:13:00.256 A:middle
This is a case where because


00:12:58.516 --> 00:13:00.256 A:middle
This is a case where because

00:13:00.256 --> 00:13:01.856 A:middle
this doesn't involve ongoing

00:13:01.856 --> 00:13:03.846 A:middle
access to the entire library,

00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:06.376 A:middle
the user has control by picking

00:13:06.376 --> 00:13:08.266 A:middle
what they share, so we don't

00:13:08.266 --> 00:13:09.596 A:middle
need to show a permission prompt

00:13:09.916 --> 00:13:11.366 A:middle
and ask them to make a decision

00:13:11.556 --> 00:13:13.066 A:middle
about future access.

00:13:14.476 --> 00:13:16.976 A:middle
This is the default method for

00:13:16.976 --> 00:13:18.696 A:middle
accessing contacts, camera, and

00:13:18.696 --> 00:13:19.586 A:middle
photos data.

00:13:20.856 --> 00:13:22.176 A:middle
There are going to be times

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.446 A:middle
where you may need access to the

00:13:23.446 --> 00:13:24.706 A:middle
broader library, but in most

00:13:24.706 --> 00:13:26.296 A:middle
situations, you'll find that

00:13:26.296 --> 00:13:27.936 A:middle
this works great for a whole lot

00:13:27.936 --> 00:13:29.186 A:middle
of apps.

00:13:31.876 --> 00:13:33.356 A:middle
This is a case where it does

00:13:33.356 --> 00:13:34.776 A:middle
just work and only requires a

00:13:34.776 --> 00:13:35.816 A:middle
few lines of code.

00:13:36.206 --> 00:13:37.326 A:middle
You can see some snippets here

00:13:37.326 --> 00:13:39.116 A:middle
for how to call these pickers in

00:13:39.116 --> 00:13:39.796 A:middle
your app.

00:13:40.656 --> 00:13:42.076 A:middle
Now as I said, there are going

00:13:42.076 --> 00:13:43.176 A:middle
to be some times where you do

00:13:43.176 --> 00:13:44.766 A:middle
need access to the broader data,

00:13:44.856 --> 00:13:46.026 A:middle
and as you know, there's a

00:13:46.026 --> 00:13:47.726 A:middle
variety of protected resources

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:50.686 A:middle
available on the device, but if

00:13:50.686 --> 00:13:52.426 A:middle
you're using one of these APIs,

00:13:53.176 --> 00:13:54.256 A:middle
you need to keep in mind three

00:13:54.256 --> 00:13:55.336 A:middle
things before you start

00:13:55.336 --> 00:13:56.646 A:middle
requesting access.

00:13:57.986 --> 00:13:59.646 A:middle
You should only request access


00:14:00.226 --> 00:14:01.836 A:middle
to the data that's necessary for

00:14:01.836 --> 00:14:04.326 A:middle
your use case in your app.

00:14:05.056 --> 00:14:06.556 A:middle
If you don't actually need the

00:14:06.556 --> 00:14:08.716 A:middle
entire library of information,

00:14:09.496 --> 00:14:10.586 A:middle
rather than requesting it, you

00:14:10.586 --> 00:14:11.806 A:middle
should look for an alternative

00:14:11.806 --> 00:14:12.886 A:middle
solution, like those

00:14:12.886 --> 00:14:13.946 A:middle
out-of-process pickers.

00:14:15.096 --> 00:14:16.296 A:middle
You should only make these

00:14:16.296 --> 00:14:17.526 A:middle
requests when it's needed.

00:14:17.526 --> 00:14:19.556 A:middle
You want it to be in the moment

00:14:19.656 --> 00:14:21.936 A:middle
when a user makes a decision not

00:14:22.366 --> 00:14:23.636 A:middle
when they first open the app and

00:14:23.636 --> 00:14:25.126 A:middle
they're bombarded with questions

00:14:25.126 --> 00:14:26.586 A:middle
that they don't even understand

00:14:26.586 --> 00:14:26.886 A:middle
yet.

00:14:27.886 --> 00:14:29.016 A:middle
You want the prompt to be in

00:14:29.016 --> 00:14:29.876 A:middle
context.

00:14:30.606 --> 00:14:32.356 A:middle
But also you want to rely only

00:14:32.356 --> 00:14:33.946 A:middle
on the API for status.

00:14:34.956 --> 00:14:36.406 A:middle
Remember, a user can revoke

00:14:36.406 --> 00:14:38.046 A:middle
their decision at any time.

00:14:38.106 --> 00:14:39.546 A:middle
You just want make sure your app

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.356 A:middle
still functions regardless of

00:14:41.356 --> 00:14:42.586 A:middle
what the user had decided.

00:14:44.326 --> 00:14:46.676 A:middle
Now when you request access, as

00:14:46.676 --> 00:14:47.996 A:middle
you know, you need to include a

00:14:47.996 --> 00:14:49.816 A:middle
purpose string or a usage

00:14:49.816 --> 00:14:50.366 A:middle
description.

00:14:51.446 --> 00:14:52.526 A:middle
And when I say you need to,

00:14:52.946 --> 00:14:54.466 A:middle
these are required.

00:14:55.596 --> 00:14:57.196 A:middle
You'll find your app rejected in

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:58.406 A:middle
app review without these, and in

00:14:58.406 --> 00:14:59.716 A:middle
fact, you'll find your apps

00:14:59.716 --> 00:15:00.946 A:middle
start crashing if you try to


00:14:59.716 --> 00:15:00.946 A:middle
start crashing if you try to

00:15:00.946 --> 00:15:02.306 A:middle
access this data without a

00:15:02.306 --> 00:15:02.916 A:middle
purpose string.

00:15:04.356 --> 00:15:06.216 A:middle
Now this is one way of providing

00:15:06.216 --> 00:15:07.306 A:middle
transparency to users.

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:08.686 A:middle
It's certainly not the only way.

00:15:09.546 --> 00:15:10.746 A:middle
By that, I don't mean showing a

00:15:10.746 --> 00:15:12.256 A:middle
fig prompt before the real one

00:15:12.256 --> 00:15:13.156 A:middle
to get them to click.

00:15:13.816 --> 00:15:14.596 A:middle
I mean this should be part of

00:15:14.596 --> 00:15:16.236 A:middle
the overall program of informing

00:15:16.236 --> 00:15:17.796 A:middle
your users about data flows in

00:15:17.796 --> 00:15:18.846 A:middle
your app.

00:15:19.496 --> 00:15:21.876 A:middle
The goal here is to explain the

00:15:21.876 --> 00:15:24.906 A:middle
reason for a request so that a

00:15:24.906 --> 00:15:26.526 A:middle
user can make an informed,

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:28.716 A:middle
effective decision based on

00:15:28.716 --> 00:15:29.716 A:middle
their priorities.

00:15:30.226 --> 00:15:32.946 A:middle
When I say explain the reason,

00:15:33.676 --> 00:15:35.176 A:middle
this is not what I'm talking

00:15:35.176 --> 00:15:35.546 A:middle
about.

00:15:36.566 --> 00:15:37.996 A:middle
And we've seen purpose strings

00:15:37.996 --> 00:15:38.936 A:middle
like this in the past, but

00:15:38.936 --> 00:15:40.526 A:middle
again, this is going to lead to

00:15:40.526 --> 00:15:41.996 A:middle
rejections in app review.

00:15:43.246 --> 00:15:44.876 A:middle
We're increasingly enforcing

00:15:45.156 --> 00:15:47.086 A:middle
quality purpose strings both

00:15:47.086 --> 00:15:48.596 A:middle
through automated validation and

00:15:48.596 --> 00:15:49.396 A:middle
manual review.

00:15:50.766 --> 00:15:53.026 A:middle
Placeholders or blank strings

00:15:53.026 --> 00:15:54.286 A:middle
are not going to be sufficient.

00:15:54.676 --> 00:15:56.316 A:middle
Just saying advertising doesn't

00:15:56.316 --> 00:15:57.016 A:middle
tell a user much.

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:58.796 A:middle
Requires location doesn't

00:15:58.796 --> 00:15:59.696 A:middle
explain the why.


00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.776 A:middle
Even this last one about more

00:16:01.776 --> 00:16:03.286 A:middle
relevant content, that's nice,

00:16:03.316 --> 00:16:05.066 A:middle
but it's pretty vague.

00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:07.586 A:middle
And when you look at our own

00:16:07.646 --> 00:16:09.376 A:middle
maps app, when it requests

00:16:09.376 --> 00:16:11.156 A:middle
location, this is what you see.

00:16:11.586 --> 00:16:12.806 A:middle
It will be displayed on the map

00:16:12.966 --> 00:16:14.676 A:middle
and used for directions, nearby

00:16:14.676 --> 00:16:15.816 A:middle
search results, and travel

00:16:15.816 --> 00:16:16.406 A:middle
times.

00:16:17.356 --> 00:16:19.046 A:middle
So this is explaining the reason

00:16:19.046 --> 00:16:21.116 A:middle
the use case for this request.

00:16:21.816 --> 00:16:24.666 A:middle
It's specific, includes examples

00:16:24.846 --> 00:16:26.206 A:middle
of how the data will be used.

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:29.696 A:middle
The TV app also, this is another

00:16:29.696 --> 00:16:31.446 A:middle
one that Apple wrote using your

00:16:31.446 --> 00:16:32.566 A:middle
location to determine what's

00:16:32.566 --> 00:16:34.136 A:middle
available to you and show you

00:16:34.136 --> 00:16:35.716 A:middle
live games, events, and news

00:16:35.716 --> 00:16:37.066 A:middle
from your area.

00:16:37.636 --> 00:16:39.396 A:middle
Remember, if users understand

00:16:39.396 --> 00:16:41.136 A:middle
why they're being asked for this

00:16:41.136 --> 00:16:42.206 A:middle
data, they're going to be more

00:16:42.206 --> 00:16:44.596 A:middle
likely to allow it.

00:16:44.726 --> 00:16:45.946 A:middle
If you were building a transit

00:16:45.946 --> 00:16:47.296 A:middle
app for a subway system, you

00:16:47.596 --> 00:16:48.876 A:middle
might write something like this.

00:16:49.146 --> 00:16:50.856 A:middle
This app uses your location to

00:16:50.856 --> 00:16:52.486 A:middle
show nearby stops and stations

00:16:52.526 --> 00:16:54.106 A:middle
and allows you to plan trips

00:16:54.106 --> 00:16:55.206 A:middle
from your current location.

00:16:56.596 --> 00:16:59.056 A:middle
Again, explain the use case, be

00:16:59.056 --> 00:17:01.396 A:middle
specific, provide an example.


00:16:59.056 --> 00:17:01.396 A:middle
specific, provide an example.

00:17:01.916 --> 00:17:04.326 A:middle
Some additional guidelines to

00:17:04.326 --> 00:17:05.276 A:middle
remember when you're working

00:17:05.276 --> 00:17:06.736 A:middle
with protected resources on a

00:17:06.736 --> 00:17:07.266 A:middle
device.

00:17:08.076 --> 00:17:09.596 A:middle
Access should not be required

00:17:09.596 --> 00:17:10.915 A:middle
for your app to function.

00:17:11.596 --> 00:17:12.715 A:middle
Again, this can lead to

00:17:12.715 --> 00:17:14.556 A:middle
rejections in the app review

00:17:14.556 --> 00:17:15.326 A:middle
process.

00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:17.856 A:middle
Your app should have graceful

00:17:17.856 --> 00:17:19.925 A:middle
fallback mechanisms so that even

00:17:19.925 --> 00:17:21.465 A:middle
if a user declines access, it

00:17:21.465 --> 00:17:22.465 A:middle
still functions.

00:17:23.056 --> 00:17:24.356 A:middle
For example, with that transit

00:17:24.356 --> 00:17:26.266 A:middle
app, if the user denies location

00:17:26.266 --> 00:17:27.906 A:middle
access, you can have a field

00:17:27.906 --> 00:17:29.026 A:middle
where they can enter location

00:17:29.026 --> 00:17:30.786 A:middle
manually and use that instead.

00:17:31.986 --> 00:17:33.586 A:middle
Again, you want to verify the

00:17:33.586 --> 00:17:35.176 A:middle
authorization status of your app

00:17:35.316 --> 00:17:37.046 A:middle
whenever it needs this data to

00:17:37.046 --> 00:17:38.776 A:middle
make sure that the user still is

00:17:38.776 --> 00:17:41.106 A:middle
getting access, and stay aware

00:17:41.106 --> 00:17:43.006 A:middle
of third-part STKs.

00:17:43.566 --> 00:17:45.136 A:middle
Again, requesting access should

00:17:45.136 --> 00:17:46.546 A:middle
only be for the use cases of

00:17:46.546 --> 00:17:48.336 A:middle
your app, and if you're

00:17:48.336 --> 00:17:49.656 A:middle
including libraries that change

00:17:49.656 --> 00:17:50.726 A:middle
that or tell you to set purpose

00:17:50.726 --> 00:17:52.226 A:middle
strings, you should probably

00:17:52.226 --> 00:17:53.686 A:middle
look for a different solution or

00:17:53.686 --> 00:17:55.026 A:middle
update your code.

00:17:55.566 --> 00:17:56.886 A:middle
Finally, you want to provide

00:17:56.886 --> 00:17:58.106 A:middle
ongoing transparency.

00:17:58.106 --> 00:17:59.326 A:middle
Again, this should not be the

00:17:59.326 --> 00:18:00.736 A:middle
only time that a user gets to


00:17:59.326 --> 00:18:00.736 A:middle
only time that a user gets to

00:18:00.736 --> 00:18:02.846 A:middle
understand how their data is

00:18:02.846 --> 00:18:03.666 A:middle
being used.

00:18:04.386 --> 00:18:05.616 A:middle
You can do this in a privacy

00:18:05.616 --> 00:18:07.086 A:middle
policy, which is required for

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.746 A:middle
apps in the App Store, or

00:18:08.746 --> 00:18:09.876 A:middle
throughout your app you can

00:18:09.876 --> 00:18:11.506 A:middle
provide links and documentation

00:18:11.676 --> 00:18:13.606 A:middle
to help users understand how

00:18:13.606 --> 00:18:14.676 A:middle
their data is being used.

00:18:16.296 --> 00:18:18.356 A:middle
Now this is all broader guidance

00:18:18.616 --> 00:18:21.026 A:middle
around these kinds of APIs, but

00:18:21.026 --> 00:18:22.206 A:middle
there's a few specific ones I

00:18:22.206 --> 00:18:23.786 A:middle
want to highlight with changes

00:18:23.786 --> 00:18:24.276 A:middle
this year.

00:18:24.766 --> 00:18:26.706 A:middle
The first is for WiFi network

00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:27.406 A:middle
information.

00:18:27.926 --> 00:18:29.546 A:middle
If your app uses see and copy

00:18:29.546 --> 00:18:30.946 A:middle
current network info, you're

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:32.236 A:middle
going to need to add an

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:33.046 A:middle
entitlement,

00:18:33.046 --> 00:18:35.566 A:middle
AccessWiFiInformation in Xcode.

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:37.996 A:middle
This is a capability that you

00:18:37.996 --> 00:18:39.076 A:middle
can enable for your app.

00:18:39.736 --> 00:18:41.666 A:middle
For example, if your app is

00:18:41.666 --> 00:18:42.746 A:middle
communicating with a hardware

00:18:42.746 --> 00:18:44.236 A:middle
accessory and needs to verify if

00:18:44.236 --> 00:18:46.066 A:middle
they're on the same network, you

00:18:46.066 --> 00:18:46.746 A:middle
would need this.

00:18:47.296 --> 00:18:48.246 A:middle
If you're not doing that use

00:18:48.246 --> 00:18:49.576 A:middle
case, you don't need to worry

00:18:49.576 --> 00:18:50.196 A:middle
about this.

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:51.536 A:middle
This is only if it's necessary

00:18:51.536 --> 00:18:52.606 A:middle
for the functionality of your

00:18:52.606 --> 00:18:52.856 A:middle
app.

00:18:53.296 --> 00:18:55.386 A:middle
You may have also heard about

00:18:55.386 --> 00:18:56.746 A:middle
our new Health Records API.

00:18:57.726 --> 00:18:59.096 A:middle
Because we know that developers

00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:00.686 A:middle
have a lot of great ideas around


00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:00.686 A:middle
have a lot of great ideas around

00:19:00.686 --> 00:19:02.156 A:middle
building apps using health data,

00:19:02.626 --> 00:19:03.916 A:middle
but we also recognize that's

00:19:04.106 --> 00:19:05.626 A:middle
very sensitive information.

00:19:06.616 --> 00:19:08.046 A:middle
So again, adjusting those

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:09.846 A:middle
privacy techniques rather than

00:19:09.846 --> 00:19:11.156 A:middle
just a simple permission prompt,

00:19:11.536 --> 00:19:12.386 A:middle
we provide a greater

00:19:12.386 --> 00:19:13.866 A:middle
transparency and control for the

00:19:13.866 --> 00:19:14.316 A:middle
user.

00:19:14.936 --> 00:19:16.166 A:middle
You can see there's a purpose

00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:17.726 A:middle
string, a link to a privacy

00:19:17.726 --> 00:19:18.706 A:middle
policy, which should be a

00:19:18.706 --> 00:19:20.226 A:middle
website or if it's in your app

00:19:20.346 --> 00:19:21.486 A:middle
available while signed out.

00:19:22.256 --> 00:19:23.676 A:middle
There's also controls over what

00:19:23.676 --> 00:19:25.076 A:middle
categories of data to share,

00:19:25.076 --> 00:19:26.266 A:middle
whether it's current or current

00:19:26.266 --> 00:19:28.156 A:middle
and future data, and there's a

00:19:28.156 --> 00:19:29.256 A:middle
session from Tuesday you can

00:19:29.256 --> 00:19:30.536 A:middle
refer to that provides a lot

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:31.926 A:middle
more information about how to

00:19:31.926 --> 00:19:34.026 A:middle
use this API in your app.

00:19:35.516 --> 00:19:37.226 A:middle
Finally, for iOS, I wanted to

00:19:37.226 --> 00:19:38.476 A:middle
share a quick update on how

00:19:38.476 --> 00:19:39.816 A:middle
Apple's been using the technique

00:19:39.816 --> 00:19:41.526 A:middle
of differential privacy to

00:19:41.526 --> 00:19:43.136 A:middle
improve our apps and devices.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.686 A:middle
The first new use case this year

00:19:45.686 --> 00:19:46.796 A:middle
is for commonly misspelled

00:19:46.796 --> 00:19:47.446 A:middle
words.

00:19:47.776 --> 00:19:49.056 A:middle
If you're typing and correct

00:19:49.056 --> 00:19:51.166 A:middle
yourself, devices that are opted

00:19:51.166 --> 00:19:52.666 A:middle
in to device analytics will now

00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:54.566 A:middle
donate data on those words to

00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:55.706 A:middle
help us improve our keyboard

00:19:55.706 --> 00:19:57.386 A:middle
algorithms even further while

00:19:57.386 --> 00:19:58.616 A:middle
protecting user privacy.

00:19:59.376 --> 00:20:01.936 A:middle
Also, for Safari, since last


00:19:59.376 --> 00:20:01.936 A:middle
Also, for Safari, since last

00:20:01.936 --> 00:20:03.126 A:middle
year, we've added the ability

00:20:03.126 --> 00:20:04.716 A:middle
for those devices to donate data

00:20:04.956 --> 00:20:06.946 A:middle
around websites that typically

00:20:06.946 --> 00:20:08.816 A:middle
cause crashes to improve the

00:20:08.816 --> 00:20:09.956 A:middle
stability of the browser.

00:20:10.456 --> 00:20:12.226 A:middle
So that's iOS.

00:20:12.226 --> 00:20:14.176 A:middle
Let's talk for a moment about

00:20:14.176 --> 00:20:15.256 A:middle
macOS as well.

00:20:15.606 --> 00:20:17.086 A:middle
Because as you may have heard,

00:20:17.436 --> 00:20:18.766 A:middle
we've made some changes to how

00:20:18.766 --> 00:20:20.356 A:middle
protected resources are handled

00:20:20.356 --> 00:20:21.236 A:middle
on macOS.

00:20:22.136 --> 00:20:23.206 A:middle
It's an expanded list of

00:20:23.206 --> 00:20:24.546 A:middle
categories of data where there

00:20:24.886 --> 00:20:26.576 A:middle
are protections in place, and

00:20:26.576 --> 00:20:27.546 A:middle
these can now trigger a

00:20:27.546 --> 00:20:29.746 A:middle
permission prompt or for some of

00:20:29.746 --> 00:20:31.056 A:middle
these an opt-in through system

00:20:31.056 --> 00:20:31.776 A:middle
preferences.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:34.076 A:middle
I just want to highlight this so

00:20:34.076 --> 00:20:35.136 A:middle
that if you're developing for

00:20:35.136 --> 00:20:37.246 A:middle
the Mac, I want you to be aware

00:20:37.246 --> 00:20:38.716 A:middle
of some of these changes because

00:20:38.716 --> 00:20:39.706 A:middle
you need to know how they're

00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:41.176 A:middle
going to affect your app if

00:20:41.176 --> 00:20:42.056 A:middle
you're accessing these

00:20:42.056 --> 00:20:42.816 A:middle
resources.

00:20:43.896 --> 00:20:45.416 A:middle
Again, since these can trigger a

00:20:45.416 --> 00:20:46.486 A:middle
permission prompt, you want to

00:20:46.486 --> 00:20:47.906 A:middle
know when that's going to happen

00:20:47.906 --> 00:20:49.446 A:middle
so your users aren't surprised,

00:20:50.136 --> 00:20:51.786 A:middle
and please note, this applies to

00:20:51.976 --> 00:20:54.006 A:middle
all third-party app processes

00:20:54.346 --> 00:20:56.666 A:middle
including those outside of the

00:20:57.236 --> 00:20:58.276 A:middle
app store.

00:20:58.496 --> 00:20:59.746 A:middle
Just like with iOS, you'll need

00:20:59.746 --> 00:21:00.886 A:middle
to set a purpose string for


00:20:59.746 --> 00:21:00.886 A:middle
to set a purpose string for

00:21:00.886 --> 00:21:02.026 A:middle
these permission prompts as

00:21:02.026 --> 00:21:03.456 A:middle
well, and again there's a

00:21:03.456 --> 00:21:04.676 A:middle
session from Tuesday that goes

00:21:04.676 --> 00:21:06.556 A:middle
into a lot more detail on how

00:21:06.556 --> 00:21:07.696 A:middle
this works for your app.

00:21:08.076 --> 00:21:11.306 A:middle
Now to talk about accessing data

00:21:11.306 --> 00:21:13.066 A:middle
on the web, I'm going to turn it

00:21:13.066 --> 00:21:14.316 A:middle
over to my fellow privacy

00:21:14.316 --> 00:21:15.976 A:middle
engineer, Brandon Van Ryswyk.

00:21:16.516 --> 00:21:22.816 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:23.316 --> 00:21:23.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Joey.

00:21:25.376 --> 00:21:27.046 A:middle
The web is one of the largest

00:21:27.046 --> 00:21:28.996 A:middle
venues for data access today.

00:21:29.856 --> 00:21:31.546 A:middle
If your business depends on

00:21:31.546 --> 00:21:33.286 A:middle
providing content on third-party

00:21:33.286 --> 00:21:35.226 A:middle
websites, this section is for

00:21:35.226 --> 00:21:35.406 A:middle
you.

00:21:37.336 --> 00:21:38.886 A:middle
This year we introduced the

00:21:38.886 --> 00:21:40.186 A:middle
Storage Access API.

00:21:41.106 --> 00:21:43.086 A:middle
The Storage Access API allows

00:21:43.086 --> 00:21:45.146 A:middle
users to engage with logged-in

00:21:45.146 --> 00:21:47.186 A:middle
content from embedded third

00:21:47.186 --> 00:21:49.926 A:middle
parties across the web including

00:21:50.126 --> 00:21:51.226 A:middle
from domains that have been

00:21:51.226 --> 00:21:53.236 A:middle
classified as a tracker by

00:21:53.236 --> 00:21:54.676 A:middle
intelligent tracking prevention.

00:21:55.806 --> 00:21:57.556 A:middle
Now the Storage Access API does

00:21:57.616 --> 00:21:59.386 A:middle
this only with the user's

00:21:59.426 --> 00:22:00.486 A:middle
explicit consent.


00:21:59.426 --> 00:22:00.486 A:middle
explicit consent.

00:22:01.016 --> 00:22:02.646 A:middle
Let's go through an example.

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:05.696 A:middle
Here the user is browsing a news

00:22:05.696 --> 00:22:08.576 A:middle
site, news.example, and the news

00:22:08.576 --> 00:22:10.036 A:middle
site has an embedded video

00:22:10.036 --> 00:22:11.786 A:middle
player from video.example.

00:22:12.686 --> 00:22:14.676 A:middle
Now the user has a paid account

00:22:14.676 --> 00:22:16.406 A:middle
on the video site and would like

00:22:16.406 --> 00:22:17.986 A:middle
to grant the embedded video

00:22:17.986 --> 00:22:20.666 A:middle
access to its cookies so that

00:22:20.666 --> 00:22:22.226 A:middle
they can enjoy the benefits of

00:22:22.226 --> 00:22:24.066 A:middle
their subscription while reading

00:22:24.066 --> 00:22:24.566 A:middle
the news.

00:22:25.746 --> 00:22:26.676 A:middle
To accomplish this,

00:22:26.776 --> 00:22:29.146 A:middle
video.example needs to implement

00:22:29.206 --> 00:22:30.576 A:middle
the Storage Access API.

00:22:32.866 --> 00:22:35.356 A:middle
Video.example should add a call

00:22:35.446 --> 00:22:37.636 A:middle
to the Storage Access API when

00:22:37.636 --> 00:22:39.336 A:middle
the user clicks the play button

00:22:39.366 --> 00:22:40.486 A:middle
in their app.

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:42.976 A:middle
Now this is an asynchronous API

00:22:43.086 --> 00:22:44.976 A:middle
that will return a promise, so

00:22:44.976 --> 00:22:46.206 A:middle
you should be prepared to handle

00:22:46.206 --> 00:22:47.856 A:middle
successes as well as failures.

00:22:48.396 --> 00:22:50.946 A:middle
So when a user clicks the play

00:22:50.946 --> 00:22:52.286 A:middle
button, this will kick off a

00:22:52.286 --> 00:22:54.726 A:middle
request, which will result in a

00:22:54.876 --> 00:22:57.296 A:middle
prompt asking the user if they

00:22:57.296 --> 00:22:58.146 A:middle
would like to grant

00:22:58.496 --> 00:23:00.776 A:middle
video.example access to its


00:22:58.496 --> 00:23:00.776 A:middle
video.example access to its

00:23:00.776 --> 00:23:02.676 A:middle
cookies while embedded in

00:23:02.676 --> 00:23:03.486 A:middle
news.example.

00:23:04.036 --> 00:23:06.896 A:middle
If the user clicks allow, this

00:23:06.896 --> 00:23:07.916 A:middle
choice will be sticky, and the

00:23:07.916 --> 00:23:09.566 A:middle
user won't be prompted again on

00:23:09.566 --> 00:23:11.006 A:middle
this combination of domains.

00:23:12.156 --> 00:23:13.516 A:middle
But if the user clicks deny, the

00:23:13.516 --> 00:23:14.776 A:middle
site can always reprompt.

00:23:15.186 --> 00:23:17.446 A:middle
Let's assume the user clicked

00:23:17.446 --> 00:23:17.836 A:middle
allow.

00:23:18.766 --> 00:23:20.776 A:middle
The request will go through, and

00:23:20.776 --> 00:23:22.396 A:middle
cookies will be returned to the

00:23:22.396 --> 00:23:22.996 A:middle
embedded site.

00:23:24.496 --> 00:23:25.376 A:middle
Now, this could create a

00:23:25.376 --> 00:23:27.106 A:middle
tracking risk as now

00:23:27.106 --> 00:23:29.466 A:middle
video.example has their users

00:23:29.566 --> 00:23:31.956 A:middle
logged in identity associated

00:23:31.956 --> 00:23:33.796 A:middle
with their presence on this news

00:23:33.796 --> 00:23:34.026 A:middle
site.

00:23:35.446 --> 00:23:36.926 A:middle
Now this is especially important

00:23:37.016 --> 00:23:38.616 A:middle
given changes to intelligent

00:23:38.616 --> 00:23:40.046 A:middle
tracking prevention this year.

00:23:41.016 --> 00:23:44.076 A:middle
Now outside of the user consent

00:23:44.076 --> 00:23:45.516 A:middle
provided via the Storage Access

00:23:45.516 --> 00:23:48.106 A:middle
API, cookies from domains that

00:23:48.106 --> 00:23:49.616 A:middle
are classified as trackers will

00:23:49.616 --> 00:23:52.156 A:middle
be partitioned immediately and

00:23:52.156 --> 00:23:53.316 A:middle
can never be used in a

00:23:53.316 --> 00:23:54.526 A:middle
third-party context.

00:23:55.916 --> 00:23:58.106 A:middle
Additionally, after 30 days

00:23:58.106 --> 00:23:59.566 A:middle
without user involvement, these

00:23:59.566 --> 00:24:01.236 A:middle
cookies will be purged entirely.


00:23:59.566 --> 00:24:01.236 A:middle
cookies will be purged entirely.

00:24:01.746 --> 00:24:05.346 A:middle
Now importantly here, access via

00:24:05.346 --> 00:24:07.466 A:middle
the Storage Access API will

00:24:07.466 --> 00:24:09.296 A:middle
count towards this 30-day

00:24:09.296 --> 00:24:10.176 A:middle
interaction timer.

00:24:11.196 --> 00:24:12.316 A:middle
That means that users who

00:24:12.346 --> 00:24:13.626 A:middle
interact frequently with your

00:24:13.626 --> 00:24:15.786 A:middle
site in a third-party context

00:24:16.016 --> 00:24:17.026 A:middle
will stay logged in.

00:24:17.476 --> 00:24:20.576 A:middle
So in this sequence, the user

00:24:20.776 --> 00:24:23.166 A:middle
will visit video.example both in

00:24:23.166 --> 00:24:24.956 A:middle
a first-party context, logged

00:24:24.956 --> 00:24:26.806 A:middle
into the home page, and in a

00:24:26.806 --> 00:24:28.456 A:middle
third-party context, where it's

00:24:28.456 --> 00:24:30.206 A:middle
embedded across the web.

00:24:31.056 --> 00:24:32.946 A:middle
So first, the user visits the

00:24:32.946 --> 00:24:34.736 A:middle
site in a first-party context.

00:24:35.606 --> 00:24:37.416 A:middle
Now notice that the days since

00:24:37.416 --> 00:24:39.206 A:middle
interaction timer will read zero

00:24:39.296 --> 00:24:40.856 A:middle
as the user is currently

00:24:40.856 --> 00:24:41.796 A:middle
interacting with the site.

00:24:43.476 --> 00:24:45.566 A:middle
But as the user interacts with

00:24:45.566 --> 00:24:47.166 A:middle
the embedded content throughout

00:24:47.166 --> 00:24:50.406 A:middle
their web browsing, the timer

00:24:50.406 --> 00:24:51.046 A:middle
will update.

00:24:52.466 --> 00:24:53.886 A:middle
This means that when the user

00:24:53.886 --> 00:24:56.146 A:middle
returns in a first-party

00:24:56.146 --> 00:24:58.316 A:middle
context, the days since

00:24:58.316 --> 00:25:00.426 A:middle
interaction timer will read 5


00:24:58.316 --> 00:25:00.426 A:middle
interaction timer will read 5

00:25:00.426 --> 00:25:04.026 A:middle
days despite there being 45 days

00:25:04.726 --> 00:25:06.136 A:middle
since the user was last on

00:25:06.136 --> 00:25:07.976 A:middle
video.example in a first-party

00:25:07.976 --> 00:25:08.686 A:middle
context.

00:25:10.096 --> 00:25:11.926 A:middle
Adopting the Storage Access API

00:25:11.926 --> 00:25:13.876 A:middle
will allow your users to stay

00:25:13.876 --> 00:25:16.446 A:middle
logged in and prevent unwanted

00:25:16.446 --> 00:25:16.816 A:middle
tracking.

00:25:17.306 --> 00:25:21.366 A:middle
Now privacy does not end with

00:25:21.366 --> 00:25:23.006 A:middle
gaining access to a user's data.

00:25:23.986 --> 00:25:25.336 A:middle
Privacy is a continued

00:25:25.336 --> 00:25:27.256 A:middle
obligation to your users to

00:25:27.256 --> 00:25:29.246 A:middle
maintain their trust throughout

00:25:29.246 --> 00:25:30.146 A:middle
the data's lifetime.

00:25:31.046 --> 00:25:32.636 A:middle
This is where data stewardship

00:25:32.766 --> 00:25:33.266 A:middle
begins.

00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:36.646 A:middle
Now I want to give you examples

00:25:36.646 --> 00:25:38.206 A:middle
from four areas of data

00:25:38.206 --> 00:25:39.466 A:middle
stewardship for you to think

00:25:39.466 --> 00:25:42.476 A:middle
about when developing your apps.

00:25:42.546 --> 00:25:43.406 A:middle
First is deletion.

00:25:44.356 --> 00:25:45.706 A:middle
Part of being a good data

00:25:45.706 --> 00:25:47.176 A:middle
steward is respecting your

00:25:47.176 --> 00:25:49.106 A:middle
user's intent to delete

00:25:49.106 --> 00:25:51.166 A:middle
something from your app.

00:25:52.696 --> 00:25:54.476 A:middle
So you should recognize that

00:25:54.476 --> 00:25:55.756 A:middle
there are data flows that go

00:25:55.846 --> 00:25:58.066 A:middle
outside your app, and you should

00:25:58.066 --> 00:26:00.236 A:middle
ensure consistency between these


00:25:58.066 --> 00:26:00.236 A:middle
ensure consistency between these

00:26:00.236 --> 00:26:02.136 A:middle
systems when the user deletes

00:26:02.136 --> 00:26:03.686 A:middle
something in your app.

00:26:04.346 --> 00:26:06.686 A:middle
Now the operating system doesn't

00:26:06.686 --> 00:26:08.066 A:middle
know what's happening inside

00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:09.776 A:middle
your app, so if you've donated

00:26:09.776 --> 00:26:11.586 A:middle
information to Siri Shortcuts or

00:26:11.586 --> 00:26:13.666 A:middle
posted a notification, you

00:26:13.666 --> 00:26:14.966 A:middle
should make sure that you delete

00:26:14.996 --> 00:26:16.786 A:middle
that content when the user

00:26:16.786 --> 00:26:18.486 A:middle
removes it from your app.

00:26:20.516 --> 00:26:22.936 A:middle
For example, if a user deletes

00:26:22.936 --> 00:26:25.186 A:middle
someone in your app's contact

00:26:25.186 --> 00:26:27.166 A:middle
list, Siri Suggestions should

00:26:27.166 --> 00:26:28.686 A:middle
not suggest them to message

00:26:28.686 --> 00:26:30.646 A:middle
using your app.

00:26:30.786 --> 00:26:32.826 A:middle
Or if a user deletes a thread in

00:26:32.826 --> 00:26:34.756 A:middle
your messaging application, you

00:26:34.756 --> 00:26:36.166 A:middle
should delete the notifications

00:26:36.166 --> 00:26:37.836 A:middle
for that content as well as it

00:26:37.836 --> 00:26:39.476 A:middle
would be unexpected for a user

00:26:39.476 --> 00:26:40.906 A:middle
to see notifications still on

00:26:40.906 --> 00:26:42.556 A:middle
their device from a thread they

00:26:42.556 --> 00:26:43.436 A:middle
thought they'd completely

00:26:43.436 --> 00:26:43.806 A:middle
deleted.

00:26:44.316 --> 00:26:46.696 A:middle
And finally, if you're a

00:26:46.696 --> 00:26:48.316 A:middle
passwords manager, and you've

00:26:48.316 --> 00:26:50.216 A:middle
donated passwords to the New

00:26:50.216 --> 00:26:52.346 A:middle
System Passwords API, you should

00:26:52.346 --> 00:26:53.326 A:middle
make sure to delete this

00:26:53.326 --> 00:26:55.336 A:middle
information if the user removes

00:26:55.336 --> 00:26:57.566 A:middle
the site from your password

00:26:58.376 --> 00:26:58.756 A:middle
manager.

00:26:59.116 --> 00:27:00.786 A:middle
Now data stewardship continues


00:26:59.116 --> 00:27:00.786 A:middle
Now data stewardship continues

00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:02.156 A:middle
through to device tracking,

00:27:02.156 --> 00:27:03.576 A:middle
which means something very

00:27:03.576 --> 00:27:05.216 A:middle
specific in the context I'll

00:27:05.216 --> 00:27:07.736 A:middle
talk about today.

00:27:07.896 --> 00:27:09.546 A:middle
You might have questions about

00:27:09.546 --> 00:27:11.666 A:middle
the devices that use your apps.

00:27:12.406 --> 00:27:14.476 A:middle
For example, did this device

00:27:14.626 --> 00:27:17.806 A:middle
already consume a free trial, or

00:27:17.966 --> 00:27:19.896 A:middle
was this device previously used

00:27:19.896 --> 00:27:21.926 A:middle
by an abusive user or for

00:27:21.926 --> 00:27:23.106 A:middle
fraudulent activities.

00:27:24.596 --> 00:27:26.026 A:middle
We offer an API called

00:27:26.026 --> 00:27:27.826 A:middle
DeviceCheck that allows you to

00:27:27.826 --> 00:27:28.986 A:middle
answer these questions.

00:27:30.716 --> 00:27:32.426 A:middle
DeviceCheck lets you set two

00:27:32.426 --> 00:27:34.536 A:middle
bits of data per device, which

00:27:34.536 --> 00:27:36.616 A:middle
are stored by Apple and can be

00:27:36.616 --> 00:27:38.126 A:middle
returned to you with a

00:27:38.126 --> 00:27:38.666 A:middle
signature.

00:27:40.036 --> 00:27:42.076 A:middle
These bits persist across a

00:27:42.076 --> 00:27:44.546 A:middle
device reset or a device erase

00:27:44.546 --> 00:27:44.966 A:middle
install.

00:27:45.466 --> 00:27:47.626 A:middle
These bits provide

00:27:47.736 --> 00:27:49.816 A:middle
high-integrity answers to your

00:27:49.816 --> 00:27:51.246 A:middle
questions about a device's

00:27:51.286 --> 00:27:54.116 A:middle
history without exposing unique

00:27:54.116 --> 00:27:55.446 A:middle
device identifiers.

00:27:58.016 --> 00:27:59.356 A:middle
Now, you should adopt

00:27:59.356 --> 00:28:01.526 A:middle
DeviceCheck and not rely on


00:27:59.356 --> 00:28:01.526 A:middle
DeviceCheck and not rely on

00:28:01.646 --> 00:28:03.346 A:middle
unsupported device tracking

00:28:03.346 --> 00:28:05.126 A:middle
mechanisms like finger printing.

00:28:05.636 --> 00:28:08.406 A:middle
As Craig said in the keynote, we

00:28:08.406 --> 00:28:10.546 A:middle
continue to remove entropy from

00:28:10.546 --> 00:28:12.836 A:middle
our platform and to remove

00:28:12.906 --> 00:28:14.166 A:middle
functionality that is being

00:28:14.166 --> 00:28:16.176 A:middle
abused to uniquely identify

00:28:16.176 --> 00:28:16.676 A:middle
users.

00:28:17.896 --> 00:28:19.556 A:middle
So you should adopt DeviceCheck

00:28:19.606 --> 00:28:20.966 A:middle
to answer your questions while

00:28:20.966 --> 00:28:22.476 A:middle
being a good data steward.

00:28:23.896 --> 00:28:25.166 A:middle
Now in addition to being a good

00:28:25.166 --> 00:28:26.686 A:middle
data steward in your own apps,

00:28:27.786 --> 00:28:28.736 A:middle
you should consider your

00:28:28.936 --> 00:28:30.876 A:middle
third-party partners as well.

00:28:33.276 --> 00:28:35.426 A:middle
Now, you as developers are

00:28:35.426 --> 00:28:37.566 A:middle
responsible for all of the code

00:28:37.696 --> 00:28:38.486 A:middle
that chips in your app.

00:28:39.516 --> 00:28:40.756 A:middle
This includes code that you've

00:28:40.756 --> 00:28:42.246 A:middle
written but also code that

00:28:42.246 --> 00:28:43.566 A:middle
you've imported in the form of a

00:28:43.566 --> 00:28:44.126 A:middle
library.

00:28:45.206 --> 00:28:46.906 A:middle
So you should understand how

00:28:46.906 --> 00:28:48.576 A:middle
these libraries that you import

00:28:49.176 --> 00:28:51.386 A:middle
access or transfer your user's

00:28:51.386 --> 00:28:52.636 A:middle
data off the device.

00:28:53.736 --> 00:28:54.976 A:middle
This way you can be complete

00:28:54.976 --> 00:28:56.186 A:middle
when giving transparency.

00:28:56.636 --> 00:28:57.746 A:middle
Don't just talk about the code

00:28:57.746 --> 00:28:58.306 A:middle
that you wrote.

00:28:58.666 --> 00:28:59.936 A:middle
You should describe the full

00:28:59.936 --> 00:29:01.426 A:middle
impact on a user's privacy.


00:28:59.936 --> 00:29:01.426 A:middle
impact on a user's privacy.

00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:04.226 A:middle
And as Joey mentioned earlier,

00:29:05.116 --> 00:29:06.806 A:middle
you should avoid unnecessary

00:29:06.806 --> 00:29:08.226 A:middle
requests for resources.

00:29:09.266 --> 00:29:12.036 A:middle
So, for example, if a library

00:29:12.036 --> 00:29:14.076 A:middle
that you want to use requires an

00:29:14.076 --> 00:29:15.926 A:middle
entitlement or access to some

00:29:16.066 --> 00:29:17.876 A:middle
other sensitive resource that

00:29:17.876 --> 00:29:19.646 A:middle
isn't required from the

00:29:19.646 --> 00:29:20.776 A:middle
functionality you're trying to

00:29:20.776 --> 00:29:22.896 A:middle
get out of this library, you

00:29:22.896 --> 00:29:23.956 A:middle
should either find a different

00:29:23.956 --> 00:29:26.016 A:middle
library or reach out to the

00:29:26.016 --> 00:29:27.606 A:middle
developer of that library and

00:29:27.606 --> 00:29:29.056 A:middle
ask them to remove that

00:29:29.056 --> 00:29:30.246 A:middle
sensitive resource request.

00:29:30.926 --> 00:29:34.076 A:middle
Now thinking about third-parties

00:29:34.146 --> 00:29:35.946 A:middle
extends to your server side as

00:29:35.946 --> 00:29:36.246 A:middle
well.

00:29:37.556 --> 00:29:39.356 A:middle
You should understand how data

00:29:39.356 --> 00:29:41.756 A:middle
flows to all third parties your

00:29:41.756 --> 00:29:42.476 A:middle
server's touch.

00:29:43.676 --> 00:29:45.796 A:middle
Now this includes the full

00:29:45.796 --> 00:29:47.516 A:middle
breadth of systems that support

00:29:47.516 --> 00:29:49.976 A:middle
your app, not just analytics or

00:29:49.976 --> 00:29:51.976 A:middle
advertising networks but the

00:29:51.976 --> 00:29:54.016 A:middle
network security systems, the

00:29:54.116 --> 00:29:55.726 A:middle
email provider that sends

00:29:55.796 --> 00:29:58.096 A:middle
customers password reset emails

00:29:58.686 --> 00:30:00.766 A:middle
or third-party customer support


00:29:58.686 --> 00:30:00.766 A:middle
or third-party customer support

00:30:00.766 --> 00:30:01.446 A:middle
integrations.

00:30:01.916 --> 00:30:04.776 A:middle
Being a good data steward means

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:06.956 A:middle
taking responsibility for the

00:30:06.956 --> 00:30:09.226 A:middle
full picture and considering

00:30:09.226 --> 00:30:10.536 A:middle
privacy when considering

00:30:10.616 --> 00:30:11.556 A:middle
partners to work with.

00:30:12.146 --> 00:30:15.466 A:middle
Now for a topic you may have

00:30:15.466 --> 00:30:16.266 A:middle
heard a little bit about,

00:30:16.506 --> 00:30:17.056 A:middle
machine learning.

00:30:18.186 --> 00:30:20.216 A:middle
So across the industry, much of

00:30:20.216 --> 00:30:21.476 A:middle
the talk about machine learning

00:30:21.856 --> 00:30:23.596 A:middle
centers around the performance

00:30:23.596 --> 00:30:24.846 A:middle
characteristics of a new

00:30:24.846 --> 00:30:26.976 A:middle
algorithm or the power of a

00:30:26.976 --> 00:30:27.936 A:middle
cloud-based solution.

00:30:28.866 --> 00:30:30.246 A:middle
And while these are important

00:30:30.246 --> 00:30:32.516 A:middle
technical developments, as Tim

00:30:32.516 --> 00:30:33.416 A:middle
said in his commencement

00:30:33.416 --> 00:30:35.776 A:middle
address, the question that we

00:30:35.776 --> 00:30:37.706 A:middle
ask is not what can we do but

00:30:38.366 --> 00:30:38.976 A:middle
what should we do.

00:30:40.206 --> 00:30:42.346 A:middle
Now this applies particularly to

00:30:42.346 --> 00:30:44.256 A:middle
machine learning, and we've been

00:30:44.256 --> 00:30:45.646 A:middle
working on it for years.

00:30:47.496 --> 00:30:49.236 A:middle
Face ID was built with

00:30:49.366 --> 00:30:50.936 A:middle
privacy-friendly machine

00:30:50.936 --> 00:30:51.976 A:middle
learning at its core.

00:30:53.416 --> 00:30:54.896 A:middle
And we've made it easy for you

00:30:54.896 --> 00:30:57.336 A:middle
to add Face ID authentication to

00:30:57.336 --> 00:30:58.496 A:middle
your apps using the

00:30:58.496 --> 00:31:00.156 A:middle
LocalAuthentication API.


00:30:58.496 --> 00:31:00.156 A:middle
LocalAuthentication API.

00:31:01.606 --> 00:31:03.126 A:middle
You can take advantage of the

00:31:03.126 --> 00:31:05.566 A:middle
work Apple has done to build

00:31:05.566 --> 00:31:07.806 A:middle
strong biometric authentication

00:31:08.206 --> 00:31:09.976 A:middle
using privacy friendly machine

00:31:09.976 --> 00:31:10.756 A:middle
learning techniques.

00:31:12.676 --> 00:31:15.936 A:middle
Similarly, ARKit uses machine

00:31:15.936 --> 00:31:16.996 A:middle
learning to model the

00:31:16.996 --> 00:31:18.486 A:middle
environment around a user's

00:31:18.486 --> 00:31:18.966 A:middle
device.

00:31:19.846 --> 00:31:22.686 A:middle
And new in ARKit 2, you can

00:31:22.686 --> 00:31:25.116 A:middle
create, persist, and store this

00:31:25.116 --> 00:31:26.436 A:middle
map of the environment in your

00:31:26.436 --> 00:31:29.396 A:middle
own apps, but you should collect

00:31:29.396 --> 00:31:31.176 A:middle
this map only if it's needed for

00:31:31.176 --> 00:31:32.836 A:middle
your feature as this data might

00:31:32.836 --> 00:31:33.686 A:middle
be quite sensitive.

00:31:34.166 --> 00:31:36.226 A:middle
It comprises a representation of

00:31:36.226 --> 00:31:38.456 A:middle
what's around a user.

00:31:38.556 --> 00:31:39.786 A:middle
So if you send it off the

00:31:39.786 --> 00:31:41.126 A:middle
device, it should be expected.

00:31:41.646 --> 00:31:42.816 A:middle
Like if you're playing a game

00:31:42.816 --> 00:31:44.186 A:middle
collaboratively with a shared

00:31:44.186 --> 00:31:44.656 A:middle
object.

00:31:45.766 --> 00:31:47.556 A:middle
And if you use Game Center, you

00:31:47.556 --> 00:31:48.596 A:middle
can take advantage of the

00:31:48.596 --> 00:31:51.156 A:middle
MultipeerConnectivity API, which

00:31:51.156 --> 00:31:52.896 A:middle
supports end-to-end encryption

00:31:53.636 --> 00:31:55.206 A:middle
to transfer these models between

00:31:55.206 --> 00:31:55.756 A:middle
devices.

00:31:57.016 --> 00:32:00.256 A:middle
Now Face ID and ARKit are good


00:31:57.016 --> 00:32:00.256 A:middle
Now Face ID and ARKit are good

00:32:00.256 --> 00:32:02.226 A:middle
examples of features that Apple

00:32:02.226 --> 00:32:04.036 A:middle
has developed that depend on

00:32:04.116 --> 00:32:05.286 A:middle
privacy-friendly machine

00:32:05.286 --> 00:32:07.136 A:middle
learning that you can use in

00:32:07.136 --> 00:32:07.706 A:middle
your apps.

00:32:09.026 --> 00:32:10.096 A:middle
But many of you want more

00:32:10.096 --> 00:32:10.766 A:middle
flexibility.

00:32:12.156 --> 00:32:15.086 A:middle
Create ML and Core ML allow you

00:32:15.436 --> 00:32:17.156 A:middle
to build your own features on

00:32:17.156 --> 00:32:17.996 A:middle
top of machine learning.

00:32:20.356 --> 00:32:23.016 A:middle
With Create ML and Core ML, it

00:32:23.016 --> 00:32:24.676 A:middle
is easier than ever to add

00:32:24.916 --> 00:32:26.816 A:middle
on-device machine learning to

00:32:26.816 --> 00:32:27.406 A:middle
your apps.

00:32:28.816 --> 00:32:30.686 A:middle
Create ML allows you to train a

00:32:30.686 --> 00:32:32.286 A:middle
machine learning model directly

00:32:32.286 --> 00:32:35.016 A:middle
on your Mac, and Core ML lets

00:32:35.016 --> 00:32:36.586 A:middle
you then take this model and

00:32:36.586 --> 00:32:38.446 A:middle
evaluate it directly on a user's

00:32:38.446 --> 00:32:38.936 A:middle
device.

00:32:40.466 --> 00:32:42.206 A:middle
This avoids collecting sensitive

00:32:42.206 --> 00:32:44.376 A:middle
user data to evaluate the model,

00:32:45.136 --> 00:32:46.926 A:middle
and protecting sensitive data on

00:32:46.926 --> 00:32:48.156 A:middle
your servers requires a lot of

00:32:48.156 --> 00:32:48.886 A:middle
engineering work.

00:32:49.496 --> 00:32:51.516 A:middle
Evaluating a model on a user's

00:32:51.516 --> 00:32:53.546 A:middle
device can lower your server's

00:32:53.546 --> 00:32:55.296 A:middle
security requirements and will

00:32:55.296 --> 00:32:56.706 A:middle
lower your breach risk as you

00:32:56.706 --> 00:32:58.256 A:middle
don't hold this sensitive

00:32:58.256 --> 00:33:00.036 A:middle
information in the first place.


00:32:58.256 --> 00:33:00.036 A:middle
information in the first place.

00:33:01.096 --> 00:33:03.566 A:middle
Now these two APIs make adoption

00:33:03.566 --> 00:33:05.276 A:middle
of on-device machine learning

00:33:05.506 --> 00:33:05.816 A:middle
easy.

00:33:08.896 --> 00:33:10.486 A:middle
And you should already be asking

00:33:10.486 --> 00:33:12.086 A:middle
privacy questions when

00:33:12.086 --> 00:33:13.256 A:middle
developing features like the

00:33:13.256 --> 00:33:15.926 A:middle
ones Joey went over earlier, and

00:33:15.926 --> 00:33:17.656 A:middle
these questions are great, and

00:33:17.656 --> 00:33:19.106 A:middle
Joey and I use them every day

00:33:19.106 --> 00:33:21.776 A:middle
doing feature reviews at Apple.

00:33:21.976 --> 00:33:23.116 A:middle
However, machine learning

00:33:23.116 --> 00:33:24.856 A:middle
requires you to ask a new set of

00:33:24.916 --> 00:33:26.986 A:middle
questions to address the same

00:33:27.096 --> 00:33:29.006 A:middle
underlying privacy goals.

00:33:30.256 --> 00:33:32.836 A:middle
For example, you should ask does

00:33:32.836 --> 00:33:35.296 A:middle
my model reveal anything about

00:33:35.296 --> 00:33:36.656 A:middle
the data it was trained on?

00:33:38.386 --> 00:33:40.456 A:middle
It's actually possible to invert

00:33:40.536 --> 00:33:42.446 A:middle
a machine learned model and

00:33:42.446 --> 00:33:44.026 A:middle
recover much of the data it was

00:33:44.026 --> 00:33:44.516 A:middle
trained on.

00:33:45.766 --> 00:33:47.446 A:middle
This could result in unexpected

00:33:47.446 --> 00:33:49.276 A:middle
disclosure if you ship a model

00:33:49.276 --> 00:33:51.076 A:middle
with your app and it's inverted

00:33:51.076 --> 00:33:53.096 A:middle
to expose information about

00:33:53.096 --> 00:33:54.126 A:middle
people it was trained on.

00:33:54.606 --> 00:33:58.006 A:middle
Now this is an area of active

00:33:58.076 --> 00:33:59.866 A:middle
academic research that you can

00:33:59.866 --> 00:34:01.066 A:middle
learn more about in the paper


00:33:59.866 --> 00:34:01.066 A:middle
learn more about in the paper

00:34:01.066 --> 00:34:03.936 A:middle
that I've put on this slide.

00:34:04.446 --> 00:34:07.076 A:middle
Similarly, you should ask, could

00:34:07.076 --> 00:34:09.576 A:middle
I infer more about my users than

00:34:09.576 --> 00:34:10.196 A:middle
they expected?

00:34:11.306 --> 00:34:13.456 A:middle
So users might expect that you'd

00:34:13.456 --> 00:34:15.616 A:middle
classify activity type via

00:34:15.616 --> 00:34:16.146 A:middle
sensor data.

00:34:17.326 --> 00:34:19.356 A:middle
But you should ask, did I

00:34:19.356 --> 00:34:21.136 A:middle
accidentally encode the fact

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:23.235 A:middle
that this specific user uses a

00:34:23.235 --> 00:34:23.746 A:middle
wheelchair?

00:34:24.255 --> 00:34:26.206 A:middle
It could be great to offer a

00:34:26.206 --> 00:34:27.406 A:middle
feature for wheelchair users,

00:34:28.436 --> 00:34:30.366 A:middle
but this should be clear and

00:34:30.366 --> 00:34:31.156 A:middle
sold as a feature.

00:34:32.596 --> 00:34:34.126 A:middle
As with general data collection,

00:34:34.126 --> 00:34:36.606 A:middle
you should obtain new consent if

00:34:36.606 --> 00:34:38.396 A:middle
you have a new use case enabled

00:34:38.396 --> 00:34:39.246 A:middle
by machine learning.

00:34:39.735 --> 00:34:42.746 A:middle
Now it turns out that two small

00:34:42.746 --> 00:34:44.516 A:middle
modifications can help mitigate

00:34:44.516 --> 00:34:45.556 A:middle
both of these issues.

00:34:47.116 --> 00:34:48.866 A:middle
The first is to ensure that you

00:34:48.866 --> 00:34:50.565 A:middle
train on the right data.

00:34:51.985 --> 00:34:53.146 A:middle
This means training on a

00:34:53.146 --> 00:34:55.516 A:middle
sufficient quantity of diverse

00:34:55.516 --> 00:34:57.646 A:middle
inputs that were collected with

00:34:57.646 --> 00:34:58.546 A:middle
the proper consent.

00:34:59.026 --> 00:35:02.226 A:middle
The second is to keep your model


00:34:59.026 --> 00:35:02.226 A:middle
The second is to keep your model

00:35:02.226 --> 00:35:04.296 A:middle
complexity proportional to the

00:35:04.296 --> 00:35:05.266 A:middle
goal that you are trying to

00:35:05.266 --> 00:35:05.636 A:middle
solve.

00:35:07.146 --> 00:35:08.436 A:middle
Both of these techniques can

00:35:08.436 --> 00:35:11.146 A:middle
prevent model overfitting, which

00:35:11.146 --> 00:35:12.916 A:middle
makes a model inversion or

00:35:12.916 --> 00:35:14.316 A:middle
unexpected inference more

00:35:14.316 --> 00:35:14.706 A:middle
likely.

00:35:15.296 --> 00:35:17.936 A:middle
Now at Apple, we believe that

00:35:17.936 --> 00:35:19.426 A:middle
considering questions like these

00:35:19.856 --> 00:35:21.326 A:middle
are an important part of

00:35:21.326 --> 00:35:22.736 A:middle
building products that users can

00:35:22.736 --> 00:35:23.116 A:middle
trust.

00:35:24.436 --> 00:35:27.286 A:middle
Because fundamentally privacy is

00:35:27.286 --> 00:35:27.986 A:middle
about people.

00:35:29.386 --> 00:35:31.226 A:middle
It's about building trust with

00:35:31.266 --> 00:35:33.586 A:middle
your users and respecting your

00:35:33.586 --> 00:35:35.286 A:middle
users in handling their data.

00:35:36.636 --> 00:35:38.276 A:middle
By applying the techniques that

00:35:38.276 --> 00:35:39.086 A:middle
we've gone over in this

00:35:39.086 --> 00:35:41.656 A:middle
presentation, you too can build

00:35:41.656 --> 00:35:44.516 A:middle
products with great features and

00:35:44.786 --> 00:35:45.776 A:middle
great privacy.

00:35:46.286 --> 00:35:49.406 A:middle
Now in summary, I hope you take

00:35:49.406 --> 00:35:51.046 A:middle
away three big ideas about

00:35:51.046 --> 00:35:51.546 A:middle
privacy.

00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:53.886 A:middle
That privacy is about people,

00:35:54.546 --> 00:35:56.456 A:middle
that you have to ask the should

00:35:56.456 --> 00:35:58.406 A:middle
questions, and that you should

00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:00.196 A:middle
align your data practices with


00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:00.196 A:middle
align your data practices with

00:36:00.196 --> 00:36:01.436 A:middle
the use cases you're trying to

00:36:01.436 --> 00:36:01.796 A:middle
solve.

00:36:02.386 --> 00:36:05.236 A:middle
For more information, please

00:36:05.236 --> 00:36:07.116 A:middle
check out these sessions, and I

00:36:07.116 --> 00:36:08.276 A:middle
look forward to seeing you at

00:36:08.276 --> 00:36:10.056 A:middle
our lab after this session so

00:36:10.146 --> 00:36:11.616 A:middle
that we can help you build

00:36:11.736 --> 00:36:13.276 A:middle
better apps through better

00:36:13.276 --> 00:36:13.846 A:middle
privacy.

00:36:14.396 --> 00:36:14.756 A:middle
Thank you.
