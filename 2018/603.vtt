00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everyone, and

00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:30.656 A:middle
welcome to Integrating Apps and

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:32.016 A:middle
Content with AR Quick Look.

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:34.176 A:middle
My name is David Lui, and I'm so

00:00:34.176 --> 00:00:35.446 A:middle
excited to talk to you about AR

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:35.926 A:middle
Quick Look.

00:00:36.556 --> 00:00:37.936 A:middle
As you all saw yesterday at the

00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:39.976 A:middle
Keynote, we brought this new

00:00:39.976 --> 00:00:41.726 A:middle
capability of previewing 3D

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:44.476 A:middle
models in AR space throughout

00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:45.606 A:middle
iOS.

00:00:45.606 --> 00:00:47.436 A:middle
AR is becoming the tool to see

00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:48.886 A:middle
what objects look like in the

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:51.096 A:middle
world, from a new sofa you're

00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:52.376 A:middle
purchasing for your living room

00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:54.386 A:middle
to that cute animated character

00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:55.766 A:middle
you're reading about in your

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:57.016 A:middle
book.

00:00:57.016 --> 00:00:58.546 A:middle
AR Quick Look was designed to

00:00:58.546 --> 00:01:01.676 A:middle
enrich any application on the OS


00:00:58.546 --> 00:01:01.676 A:middle
enrich any application on the OS

00:01:01.676 --> 00:01:03.836 A:middle
with AR content with a simpler

00:01:03.836 --> 00:01:06.266 A:middle
way to adopt AR previewing for

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.986 A:middle
consistent viewing experience.

00:01:08.786 --> 00:01:11.426 A:middle
So, in this session, we'll take

00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:13.176 A:middle
a deeper look at what AR Quick

00:01:13.176 --> 00:01:15.516 A:middle
Look is, how to design your app

00:01:15.516 --> 00:01:17.286 A:middle
and web page to take advantage

00:01:17.486 --> 00:01:19.526 A:middle
of AR Quick Look, and creating

00:01:19.526 --> 00:01:22.686 A:middle
content specifically for it.

00:01:22.936 --> 00:01:23.706 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:26.566 A:middle
So, let me show you what AR

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.116 A:middle
Quick Look is with the files

00:01:28.116 --> 00:01:28.366 A:middle
app.

00:01:28.926 --> 00:01:30.326 A:middle
Let's preview the 3D silver

00:01:30.326 --> 00:01:32.186 A:middle
pitcher model and push it into

00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:32.376 A:middle
AR.

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:35.046 A:middle
We find the table, and we place

00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:36.296 A:middle
the pitcher on the surface.

00:01:37.146 --> 00:01:38.256 A:middle
You can see the pitcher on a

00:01:38.256 --> 00:01:40.146 A:middle
1-to-1 scale and get a better

00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:42.016 A:middle
understanding of how it fits

00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:42.726 A:middle
with your surrounding.

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:45.166 A:middle
On my table, I have an Apple

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.126 A:middle
mug, some Post-its, and a

00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:49.246 A:middle
kettle, and it looks so

00:01:49.246 --> 00:01:50.526 A:middle
realistic with these items.

00:01:51.376 --> 00:01:52.916 A:middle
And what's really amazing is

00:01:52.916 --> 00:01:54.106 A:middle
that you can see the colorful

00:01:54.106 --> 00:01:56.016 A:middle
Post-its reflecting on the lower

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:58.306 A:middle
body of the pitcher, giving this

00:01:58.306 --> 00:01:59.876 A:middle
illusion that it's actually

00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:00.316 A:middle
really there.


00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:00.316 A:middle
really there.

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:02.586 A:middle
So, it's really magical how the

00:02:02.586 --> 00:02:04.016 A:middle
virtual pitcher blends in with

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:04.866 A:middle
the physical world.

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:08.696 A:middle
To help get my lovely pitcher in

00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:10.476 A:middle
the world, we're using AR Quick

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:11.086 A:middle
Look.

00:02:11.426 --> 00:02:14.116 A:middle
The way to preview 3D content in

00:02:14.116 --> 00:02:14.296 A:middle
AR.

00:02:14.296 --> 00:02:16.856 A:middle
AR Quick Look is built in and

00:02:16.956 --> 00:02:19.316 A:middle
deeply integrated into the OS to

00:02:19.316 --> 00:02:20.766 A:middle
allow previewing from any

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.346 A:middle
application and websites.

00:02:23.986 --> 00:02:25.756 A:middle
The deep integration comes from

00:02:25.756 --> 00:02:27.456 A:middle
us using, of course, Quick Look

00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:29.396 A:middle
technologies and expanding its

00:02:29.396 --> 00:02:30.996 A:middle
capabilities to enhance the

00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:32.906 A:middle
system experience with AR.

00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:36.086 A:middle
The AR portion of Quick Look is

00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:38.366 A:middle
available in iOS 12 on ARKit

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:40.716 A:middle
compatible devices and only

00:02:40.716 --> 00:02:42.776 A:middle
object mode on non-ARKit

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:43.606 A:middle
supported devices.

00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:46.436 A:middle
You'll see this new AR file icon

00:02:46.696 --> 00:02:48.786 A:middle
throughout the OS to represent

00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:50.846 A:middle
the new 3D file format usdz.

00:02:50.846 --> 00:02:53.416 A:middle
Let's invite you to Quick Look,

00:02:53.786 --> 00:02:56.166 A:middle
the 3D content in our viewer and

00:02:56.166 --> 00:02:57.366 A:middle
see how it looks like in your

00:02:57.366 --> 00:02:57.586 A:middle
world.

00:02:58.446 --> 00:02:59.926 A:middle
So, let's tap on the icon to

00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:01.986 A:middle
launch AR Quick Look.


00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:01.986 A:middle
launch AR Quick Look.

00:03:01.986 --> 00:03:03.426 A:middle
AR Quick Look handles setting up

00:03:03.426 --> 00:03:05.276 A:middle
the AR experience like plane

00:03:05.276 --> 00:03:07.666 A:middle
detection, object placement,

00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:10.326 A:middle
gesture manipulations, and

00:03:10.326 --> 00:03:11.776 A:middle
creating contact shadows.

00:03:12.456 --> 00:03:14.126 A:middle
But these are only a subset of

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:15.926 A:middle
all the viewer capabilities that

00:03:15.926 --> 00:03:17.326 A:middle
together with rendering a 3D

00:03:17.326 --> 00:03:19.086 A:middle
model, provides an immersive

00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:19.766 A:middle
experience.

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:23.396 A:middle
So, use AR Quick Look if your

00:03:23.396 --> 00:03:25.286 A:middle
goal is to preview 3D objects

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:26.746 A:middle
and push them into the world.

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:28.696 A:middle
By adopting our new system

00:03:28.696 --> 00:03:30.846 A:middle
viewer, you got a consistent 3D

00:03:30.846 --> 00:03:32.476 A:middle
content previewing experience,

00:03:32.896 --> 00:03:34.116 A:middle
so you don't need to create your

00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:35.003 A:middle
own.

00:03:35.156 --> 00:03:36.776 A:middle
It's really easy to adopt and

00:03:36.776 --> 00:03:38.196 A:middle
integrate the viewer into a

00:03:38.196 --> 00:03:39.676 A:middle
website and application and it

00:03:39.676 --> 00:03:40.986 A:middle
could be as simple as embedding

00:03:41.056 --> 00:03:43.236 A:middle
a usdz file if your application

00:03:43.316 --> 00:03:44.736 A:middle
already supports and uses Quick

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:44.916 A:middle
Look.

00:03:46.546 --> 00:03:47.376 A:middle
Just as you saw from the

00:03:47.406 --> 00:03:48.996 A:middle
previous slide, AR Quick Look

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:50.586 A:middle
does all the heavy work for you

00:03:50.826 --> 00:03:52.576 A:middle
in providing and creating a

00:03:52.626 --> 00:03:53.906 A:middle
great AR experience.

00:03:54.656 --> 00:03:56.196 A:middle
And it's truly magical how you

00:03:56.196 --> 00:03:58.826 A:middle
get an amazing AR experience by

00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:00.326 A:middle
just providing the 3D content


00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:00.326 A:middle
just providing the 3D content

00:04:00.476 --> 00:04:02.036 A:middle
and we make this super easy for

00:04:02.036 --> 00:04:02.966 A:middle
you so you don't have to deal

00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:04.486 A:middle
with any AR specifics.

00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:07.386 A:middle
So, how about we see AR Quick

00:04:07.386 --> 00:04:08.546 A:middle
Look in action with the web

00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:08.826 A:middle
demo.

00:04:11.516 --> 00:04:16.196 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:04:16.696 --> 00:04:18.206 A:middle
So, here, I have the files up,

00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:20.096 A:middle
and I have a catalogue of 3D

00:04:20.096 --> 00:04:20.606 A:middle
objects.

00:04:21.236 --> 00:04:22.656 A:middle
You'll notice that there's these

00:04:22.816 --> 00:04:24.286 A:middle
rich and beautiful thumbnails

00:04:24.286 --> 00:04:26.146 A:middle
with the AR badge stamp at the

00:04:26.146 --> 00:04:27.366 A:middle
top right-hand corner, and

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:28.156 A:middle
that's there to tell you that

00:04:28.156 --> 00:04:29.376 A:middle
there's an AR experience behind

00:04:29.376 --> 00:04:29.666 A:middle
this.

00:04:30.356 --> 00:04:31.806 A:middle
So, I have a lot of great models

00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:33.356 A:middle
to choose from, but my personal

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:34.926 A:middle
favorite is this little purple

00:04:34.926 --> 00:04:36.716 A:middle
guy at the top right-hand

00:04:36.716 --> 00:04:37.036 A:middle
corner.

00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:39.576 A:middle
So, Radar is our bug tracking

00:04:39.576 --> 00:04:41.366 A:middle
software, and if you don't know,

00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:43.156 A:middle
the purple aardvark is our

00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:43.556 A:middle
mascot.

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:45.976 A:middle
So, I'll go ahead and Quick Look

00:04:46.116 --> 00:04:47.496 A:middle
the purple aardvark into the

00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:50.816 A:middle
viewer where we can see her in

00:04:50.896 --> 00:04:52.886 A:middle
our studio-like environment,

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:54.006 A:middle
which we call object mode.

00:04:55.326 --> 00:04:56.426 A:middle
So, you can really pan around

00:04:56.426 --> 00:04:58.466 A:middle
and see the model from various

00:04:58.466 --> 00:04:59.176 A:middle
different angles.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.316 A:middle
We can pinch to size an object


00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.316 A:middle
We can pinch to size an object

00:05:01.616 --> 00:05:03.266 A:middle
and make it look a lot larger

00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:04.746 A:middle
and really see the fine details

00:05:04.746 --> 00:05:05.626 A:middle
that went into this model.

00:05:06.486 --> 00:05:08.506 A:middle
So, you can see how there's

00:05:08.506 --> 00:05:10.196 A:middle
animation baked into this model,

00:05:10.756 --> 00:05:12.186 A:middle
and AR Quick Look supports

00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:14.036 A:middle
transform animation and skeletal

00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:15.706 A:middle
animation, so the purple

00:05:15.706 --> 00:05:17.476 A:middle
aardvark is really lively and

00:05:17.476 --> 00:05:18.536 A:middle
animated with personality.

00:05:20.116 --> 00:05:21.596 A:middle
And just like a photo, you can

00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:22.846 A:middle
double tap on the model to

00:05:22.846 --> 00:05:24.206 A:middle
recess the position and the

00:05:24.206 --> 00:05:24.576 A:middle
size.

00:05:25.246 --> 00:05:27.346 A:middle
But of course, the beauty really

00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:29.056 A:middle
comes from pushing my purple

00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:30.246 A:middle
aardvark into the world.

00:05:30.526 --> 00:05:34.656 A:middle
So, I'll tap on the AR tab, and

00:05:34.656 --> 00:05:36.526 A:middle
there, the purple aardvark is in

00:05:36.526 --> 00:05:36.936 A:middle
the world.

00:05:37.846 --> 00:05:40.366 A:middle
And so we were able to place the

00:05:40.366 --> 00:05:42.836 A:middle
model so quickly into the world

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:44.066 A:middle
because we started the AR

00:05:44.066 --> 00:05:45.966 A:middle
session the moment AR Quick Look

00:05:46.106 --> 00:05:47.726 A:middle
was launched, and we gathered

00:05:47.726 --> 00:05:48.846 A:middle
all the feature points of the

00:05:48.846 --> 00:05:50.386 A:middle
environment and pushed the

00:05:50.386 --> 00:05:51.416 A:middle
objects quickly out into the

00:05:51.416 --> 00:05:51.736 A:middle
world.

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:55.116 A:middle
So, right here, you can notice

00:05:55.116 --> 00:05:56.676 A:middle
that the controls are hidden for

00:05:56.676 --> 00:05:58.066 A:middle
a full immersive experience.

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.376 A:middle
Controls like the status bar,

00:05:59.696 --> 00:06:01.226 A:middle
on-screen controls and iPhone X,


00:05:59.696 --> 00:06:01.226 A:middle
on-screen controls and iPhone X,

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:03.326 A:middle
we hide the home indicator.

00:06:04.746 --> 00:06:06.526 A:middle
So, you can go ahead and rotate

00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:08.246 A:middle
the objects using your standard

00:06:08.246 --> 00:06:09.516 A:middle
iOS rotation gestures.

00:06:09.906 --> 00:06:11.396 A:middle
You can scale the object down

00:06:11.396 --> 00:06:13.406 A:middle
using your two-finger pinch and

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:14.516 A:middle
scale it larger if you want it

00:06:14.516 --> 00:06:15.346 A:middle
to be a lot cuter.

00:06:16.156 --> 00:06:17.246 A:middle
And so, you can see that

00:06:17.246 --> 00:06:18.976 A:middle
animation there where the purple

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:20.856 A:middle
aardvark is just fixing all my

00:06:20.856 --> 00:06:23.076 A:middle
bugs and just slurping them up.

00:06:23.306 --> 00:06:24.156 A:middle
So, I can go ahead and

00:06:24.156 --> 00:06:25.356 A:middle
double-tap to reset the size

00:06:25.356 --> 00:06:27.776 A:middle
back to 100%, and you can

00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:30.256 A:middle
translate the model by just

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:31.576 A:middle
tapping on it and dragging it to

00:06:31.576 --> 00:06:32.636 A:middle
a different place on the table.

00:06:34.216 --> 00:06:35.786 A:middle
Or you can tap on it and move

00:06:35.786 --> 00:06:37.616 A:middle
the device around for device

00:06:37.616 --> 00:06:39.346 A:middle
movement, really seamless

00:06:39.346 --> 00:06:39.966 A:middle
interactions.

00:06:41.006 --> 00:06:42.446 A:middle
Of course, since this is an AR

00:06:42.446 --> 00:06:43.646 A:middle
experience, we really encourage

00:06:43.646 --> 00:06:47.536 A:middle
you to walk around and be really

00:06:47.536 --> 00:06:49.946 A:middle
engaged and immerse and see that

00:06:49.946 --> 00:06:51.706 A:middle
animation, see the model that's

00:06:51.706 --> 00:06:52.686 A:middle
pushed out into the world.

00:06:55.836 --> 00:06:57.476 A:middle
So, we've also provided a

00:06:57.476 --> 00:06:58.346 A:middle
contact shadow.

00:06:58.656 --> 00:06:59.846 A:middle
So, you'll notice right there


00:07:00.056 --> 00:07:01.656 A:middle
just sitting on the edge, this

00:07:01.656 --> 00:07:03.176 A:middle
tells you that the purple

00:07:03.176 --> 00:07:04.696 A:middle
aardvark is grounded and placed

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:06.096 A:middle
on that table in the world.

00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:08.406 A:middle
And what makes the aardvark look

00:07:08.406 --> 00:07:10.096 A:middle
so amazing right now is that

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:10.966 A:middle
we're matching the color

00:07:10.966 --> 00:07:12.206 A:middle
intensity and the temperature

00:07:12.206 --> 00:07:13.516 A:middle
that's reported by ARKit from

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.036 A:middle
the world, and we're using that

00:07:15.036 --> 00:07:15.946 A:middle
with our lighting setup.

00:07:17.676 --> 00:07:19.426 A:middle
So, I think this is really

00:07:19.426 --> 00:07:19.886 A:middle
amazing.

00:07:19.886 --> 00:07:21.226 A:middle
I want to remember this moment.

00:07:21.476 --> 00:07:22.366 A:middle
So, I'm going to go ahead and

00:07:22.366 --> 00:07:23.646 A:middle
tap to show the controls.

00:07:23.736 --> 00:07:25.686 A:middle
I'm going to take a snapshot of

00:07:25.726 --> 00:07:25.976 A:middle
this.

00:07:28.206 --> 00:07:29.546 A:middle
So, right here, I'm going to go

00:07:29.546 --> 00:07:30.796 A:middle
ahead and mark up the moment,

00:07:35.216 --> 00:07:37.036 A:middle
and this is really amazing, so I

00:07:37.036 --> 00:07:38.126 A:middle
can save this later and take a

00:07:38.126 --> 00:07:38.616 A:middle
look at this.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:45.046 A:middle
But with AR Quick Look, we

00:07:45.046 --> 00:07:46.476 A:middle
really wanted to make AR

00:07:46.476 --> 00:07:48.506 A:middle
accessible to everyone, and we

00:07:48.506 --> 00:07:49.596 A:middle
do mean everyone.

00:07:50.066 --> 00:07:51.396 A:middle
Accessibility is one of our core

00:07:51.396 --> 00:07:53.536 A:middle
values, and so we made AR Quick

00:07:53.536 --> 00:07:55.166 A:middle
Look work with VoiceOver and

00:07:55.166 --> 00:07:55.646 A:middle
switch control.

00:07:56.126 --> 00:07:56.816 A:middle
So, let me show you the

00:07:56.816 --> 00:07:57.826 A:middle
VoiceOver flow right now.

00:07:58.606 --> 00:07:59.406 A:middle
So, I'll triple click the home

00:07:59.406 --> 00:08:00.676 A:middle
button to activate VoiceOver.


00:07:59.406 --> 00:08:00.676 A:middle
button to activate VoiceOver.

00:08:02.256 --> 00:08:03.596 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on.

00:08:03.596 --> 00:08:05.156 A:middle
Files. Close.

00:08:05.326 --> 00:08:06.006 A:middle
Button. Landscape.

00:08:06.006 --> 00:08:07.616 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, I navigate over to the AR

00:08:07.616 --> 00:08:07.936 A:middle
tab.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.276 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Home button to the right.

00:08:10.676 --> 00:08:11.696 A:middle
AR button.

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.276 A:middle
Selected AR.

00:08:14.516 --> 00:08:17.046 A:middle
Radar aardvark is now positioned

00:08:17.046 --> 00:08:17.586 A:middle
in the world.

00:08:18.626 --> 00:08:19.756 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And what's really cool is now

00:08:19.756 --> 00:08:21.466 A:middle
you get audible feedback for

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:23.796 A:middle
when my Radar aardvark is off

00:08:23.796 --> 00:08:24.066 A:middle
screen.

00:08:25.516 --> 00:08:26.936 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Radar aardvark is now off

00:08:26.966 --> 00:08:27.406 A:middle
screen.

00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:29.126 A:middle
&gt;&gt; AR when is back on screen.

00:08:29.466 --> 00:08:30.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Radar aardvark is now on

00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:31.376 A:middle
screen.

00:08:32.015 --> 00:08:33.216 A:middle
&gt;&gt; And this is really amazing,

00:08:33.216 --> 00:08:35.076 A:middle
and we really encourage

00:08:35.466 --> 00:08:38.106 A:middle
developers and users to really

00:08:38.106 --> 00:08:39.076 A:middle
think about the full

00:08:39.076 --> 00:08:40.826 A:middle
accessibility workflow in your

00:08:40.826 --> 00:08:42.696 A:middle
applications and websites as you

00:08:42.696 --> 00:08:44.275 A:middle
adopt and integrate AR Quick

00:08:44.376 --> 00:08:44.566 A:middle
Look.

00:08:47.356 --> 00:08:49.356 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.196 A:middle
So, I just showed you AR Quick

00:08:51.196 --> 00:08:53.286 A:middle
Look integrated into the files

00:08:53.836 --> 00:08:55.876 A:middle
app, but that's one of six first

00:08:55.946 --> 00:08:57.546 A:middle
party apps to have adopted and

00:08:57.546 --> 00:08:58.326 A:middle
integrate the viewer.

00:08:59.066 --> 00:09:02.806 A:middle
The others are mail, messages,


00:08:59.066 --> 00:09:02.806 A:middle
The others are mail, messages,

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:06.796 A:middle
notes, news, and Safari.

00:09:07.846 --> 00:09:09.496 A:middle
And the great news is with AR

00:09:09.496 --> 00:09:11.066 A:middle
Quick Look built into Safari

00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:13.056 A:middle
itself, developers can integrate

00:09:13.406 --> 00:09:15.536 A:middle
it into their websites by using

00:09:15.536 --> 00:09:16.856 A:middle
our notational [phonetic] markup

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:18.106 A:middle
that I'll talk more about later.

00:09:19.076 --> 00:09:20.916 A:middle
Lastly, you can adopt a viewer

00:09:21.196 --> 00:09:22.876 A:middle
into your iOS application to

00:09:22.876 --> 00:09:24.156 A:middle
provide a more immersive

00:09:24.156 --> 00:09:25.066 A:middle
experience with AR.

00:09:27.656 --> 00:09:29.646 A:middle
So, sharing a 3D model between

00:09:29.746 --> 00:09:31.436 A:middle
all these apps requires the

00:09:31.436 --> 00:09:32.846 A:middle
models to be bundled up in a

00:09:32.846 --> 00:09:34.146 A:middle
single sharable file.

00:09:34.696 --> 00:09:36.306 A:middle
To enable this, AR Quick Look

00:09:36.306 --> 00:09:39.006 A:middle
supports usdz, which is a new

00:09:39.006 --> 00:09:40.536 A:middle
file format for mobile

00:09:40.536 --> 00:09:42.196 A:middle
distribution of 3D models.

00:09:42.956 --> 00:09:45.046 A:middle
usdz packages all these models

00:09:45.446 --> 00:09:47.156 A:middle
and textures into a single file

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:49.076 A:middle
for efficient delivery of 3D

00:09:49.076 --> 00:09:50.926 A:middle
content without having to work

00:09:50.926 --> 00:09:52.226 A:middle
with reference files.

00:09:53.076 --> 00:09:54.326 A:middle
It's based on Pixar's

00:09:54.766 --> 00:09:56.856 A:middle
open-source universal scene

00:09:56.856 --> 00:09:58.916 A:middle
description format, or short,

00:09:59.276 --> 00:09:59.666 A:middle
USD.


00:10:00.956 --> 00:10:03.576 A:middle
And usdz is supported on iOS and

00:10:03.576 --> 00:10:06.206 A:middle
macOS, in SceneKit and Model

00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:08.726 A:middle
I/O, and later in the session,

00:10:08.956 --> 00:10:10.316 A:middle
we'll show you how to convert 3D

00:10:10.316 --> 00:10:12.726 A:middle
models into the usdz format

00:10:12.926 --> 00:10:15.016 A:middle
using the new usdz Converter

00:10:15.016 --> 00:10:16.916 A:middle
tool that ships as part of Xcode

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:17.006 A:middle
10.

00:10:19.186 --> 00:10:20.616 A:middle
Now that you know more about AR

00:10:20.616 --> 00:10:22.056 A:middle
Quick Look, let's talk about how

00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:23.506 A:middle
to integrate the viewer itself.

00:10:25.006 --> 00:10:26.206 A:middle
You can integrate AR Quick Look

00:10:26.496 --> 00:10:27.786 A:middle
in two different mediums.

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:29.776 A:middle
The first, in an application.

00:10:30.506 --> 00:10:31.716 A:middle
Apps that showcase a lot of

00:10:31.716 --> 00:10:33.726 A:middle
photos and text can provide

00:10:33.726 --> 00:10:35.476 A:middle
better imagery and a really

00:10:35.476 --> 00:10:36.926 A:middle
immersive experience with AR

00:10:36.926 --> 00:10:37.756 A:middle
Quick Look integrated.

00:10:38.316 --> 00:10:39.896 A:middle
And here, we're using Quick Look

00:10:39.896 --> 00:10:41.516 A:middle
API to facilitate this

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.416 A:middle
integration, to preview usdz

00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:45.066 A:middle
files, and load them into the

00:10:45.066 --> 00:10:45.366 A:middle
viewer.

00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:48.086 A:middle
Second, is in websites in

00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:48.546 A:middle
Safari.

00:10:49.376 --> 00:10:51.106 A:middle
So, integrating AR Quick Look in

00:10:51.106 --> 00:10:52.946 A:middle
news articles and product pages

00:10:52.946 --> 00:10:54.506 A:middle
of online storefronts really

00:10:54.506 --> 00:10:55.626 A:middle
complements the reading and

00:10:55.626 --> 00:10:57.496 A:middle
shopping experience by providing

00:10:57.496 --> 00:10:58.836 A:middle
a new way to visualize the

00:10:58.836 --> 00:11:00.576 A:middle
content and develop a better


00:10:58.836 --> 00:11:00.576 A:middle
content and develop a better

00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:01.876 A:middle
understanding of what you're

00:11:01.876 --> 00:11:03.366 A:middle
actually seeing, and we'll be

00:11:03.366 --> 00:11:06.046 A:middle
writing HTML to allow previewing

00:11:06.476 --> 00:11:07.986 A:middle
AR content on the web.

00:11:09.526 --> 00:11:10.306 A:middle
So, let's get started with

00:11:10.306 --> 00:11:11.856 A:middle
applications and how the Quick

00:11:11.856 --> 00:11:14.036 A:middle
Look API is used to provide an

00:11:14.036 --> 00:11:14.906 A:middle
AR experience.

00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:17.126 A:middle
So, if you're not already

00:11:17.126 --> 00:11:19.026 A:middle
familiar, let me quickly explain

00:11:19.066 --> 00:11:19.456 A:middle
Quick Look.

00:11:20.216 --> 00:11:21.266 A:middle
Quick Look is all about

00:11:21.266 --> 00:11:22.836 A:middle
previewing documents like

00:11:22.936 --> 00:11:26.206 A:middle
Keynotes, PDFs, images, and now

00:11:26.206 --> 00:11:27.706 A:middle
3D model files like usdz.

00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:30.376 A:middle
Quick Look itself is an iOS

00:11:30.376 --> 00:11:31.786 A:middle
framework that not only provides

00:11:31.786 --> 00:11:33.756 A:middle
support to preview documents,

00:11:33.956 --> 00:11:35.126 A:middle
but also will be really to

00:11:35.176 --> 00:11:37.066 A:middle
create and provide custom

00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:38.386 A:middle
previews for your custom file

00:11:38.476 --> 00:11:38.846 A:middle
types.

00:11:39.826 --> 00:11:40.906 A:middle
It comes with everything you

00:11:40.906 --> 00:11:42.206 A:middle
need to preview documents.

00:11:42.886 --> 00:11:44.456 A:middle
You can control the transition

00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:46.376 A:middle
and the different presentation

00:11:46.376 --> 00:11:47.996 A:middle
modes for Quick Look, like being

00:11:47.996 --> 00:11:50.026 A:middle
embedded inline or incorporating

00:11:50.026 --> 00:11:51.786 A:middle
a push navigation flow and the

00:11:51.786 --> 00:11:53.016 A:middle
standard modal presentation.

00:11:54.286 --> 00:11:55.226 A:middle
And what's really amazing is

00:11:55.226 --> 00:11:56.856 A:middle
that security is handled for you

00:11:57.276 --> 00:11:58.606 A:middle
where the contents of the usdz

00:11:58.706 --> 00:12:01.156 A:middle
file is safely read to present a


00:11:58.706 --> 00:12:01.156 A:middle
file is safely read to present a

00:12:01.156 --> 00:12:02.746 A:middle
preview for you.

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:04.566 A:middle
Now, there's a dedicated endup

00:12:04.566 --> 00:12:06.696 A:middle
session about Quick Look and

00:12:06.696 --> 00:12:08.006 A:middle
previewing all file types,

00:12:08.006 --> 00:12:10.056 A:middle
including the new usdz file type

00:12:10.056 --> 00:12:10.916 A:middle
that I encourage you to check

00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:10.983 A:middle
out.

00:12:13.346 --> 00:12:15.426 A:middle
So, let's take a quick look at

00:12:15.426 --> 00:12:16.716 A:middle
the preview flow.

00:12:16.956 --> 00:12:18.006 A:middle
Here's the apps ViewController

00:12:18.086 --> 00:12:18.596 A:middle
on the left.

00:12:19.136 --> 00:12:20.816 A:middle
It has a grid of thumbnails for

00:12:20.816 --> 00:12:22.076 A:middle
various 3D models.

00:12:22.486 --> 00:12:23.376 A:middle
When someone taps on one of

00:12:23.376 --> 00:12:24.896 A:middle
these thumbnails, I want to show

00:12:24.896 --> 00:12:25.726 A:middle
a Quick Look preview of the

00:12:25.726 --> 00:12:26.886 A:middle
model for that thumbnail.

00:12:27.596 --> 00:12:29.246 A:middle
The first thing I want to do is

00:12:29.246 --> 00:12:31.126 A:middle
create a QLPreviewController.

00:12:31.596 --> 00:12:32.826 A:middle
I have instance, I have

00:12:32.826 --> 00:12:34.096 A:middle
ViewController that allows you

00:12:34.096 --> 00:12:35.046 A:middle
to preview documents.

00:12:35.806 --> 00:12:37.876 A:middle
And I set myself as a dataSource

00:12:38.126 --> 00:12:38.706 A:middle
and a delegate.

00:12:38.916 --> 00:12:40.586 A:middle
So it can ask me questions about

00:12:40.586 --> 00:12:41.476 A:middle
what should be previewed.

00:12:42.496 --> 00:12:43.876 A:middle
With that configured, I present

00:12:43.876 --> 00:12:45.256 A:middle
that QLPreviewController.

00:12:46.086 --> 00:12:47.836 A:middle
Now, it doesn't appear

00:12:47.836 --> 00:12:48.766 A:middle
immediately, however.

00:12:49.036 --> 00:12:50.636 A:middle
It first asks me some questions.

00:12:51.336 --> 00:12:53.186 A:middle
It starts by asking how many

00:12:53.186 --> 00:12:54.486 A:middle
items do you have for me to

00:12:55.256 --> 00:12:55.826 A:middle
preview?

00:12:55.826 --> 00:12:57.736 A:middle
And for usdz files, the answer

00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:58.096 A:middle
is one.

00:12:59.386 --> 00:13:01.746 A:middle
Now, it asks me for a URL for


00:12:59.386 --> 00:13:01.746 A:middle
Now, it asks me for a URL for

00:13:01.746 --> 00:13:03.376 A:middle
the first item to be previewed,

00:13:04.066 --> 00:13:05.846 A:middle
and I respond with the file URL

00:13:06.316 --> 00:13:08.316 A:middle
for my app bundle for the model

00:13:08.316 --> 00:13:10.046 A:middle
that was tapped.

00:13:10.106 --> 00:13:12.056 A:middle
Finally, it asks me for the view

00:13:12.056 --> 00:13:13.856 A:middle
to use as a source view for the

00:13:13.856 --> 00:13:15.356 A:middle
transition animation for when

00:13:15.356 --> 00:13:16.296 A:middle
the preview is presented.

00:13:16.856 --> 00:13:18.666 A:middle
And here, I want a seamless

00:13:18.666 --> 00:13:20.276 A:middle
animation from the view that was

00:13:20.356 --> 00:13:21.576 A:middle
tapped to the view that was

00:13:21.576 --> 00:13:22.376 A:middle
going to be presented.

00:13:22.776 --> 00:13:24.306 A:middle
And so, I return View #3.

00:13:25.536 --> 00:13:27.366 A:middle
With all that configured, we're

00:13:27.366 --> 00:13:28.606 A:middle
ready to present our preview

00:13:28.606 --> 00:13:30.496 A:middle
controller, and so it's going to

00:13:30.496 --> 00:13:31.776 A:middle
animate and scale up from the

00:13:31.816 --> 00:13:32.486 A:middle
view that was tapped.

00:13:32.486 --> 00:13:35.556 A:middle
And this is what it looks like

00:13:35.556 --> 00:13:35.856 A:middle
in code.

00:13:36.626 --> 00:13:38.026 A:middle
In order to preview and present

00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:39.466 A:middle
documents, we need to

00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:40.506 A:middle
instantiate a

00:13:40.506 --> 00:13:41.466 A:middle
QLPreviewController.

00:13:42.016 --> 00:13:42.856 A:middle
It's part of the Quick Look

00:13:42.856 --> 00:13:43.216 A:middle
framework.

00:13:43.506 --> 00:13:45.756 A:middle
It has a dataSource and a

00:13:45.756 --> 00:13:47.346 A:middle
delegate, which I'll get into in

00:13:47.346 --> 00:13:47.686 A:middle
a bit.

00:13:48.366 --> 00:13:50.016 A:middle
And then we then present the

00:13:50.046 --> 00:13:51.276 A:middle
previewController modally.

00:13:52.326 --> 00:13:53.086 A:middle
Pretty simple, right.

00:13:53.826 --> 00:13:54.976 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the

00:13:54.976 --> 00:13:56.476 A:middle
protocol for a dataSource.

00:13:58.336 --> 00:14:00.026 A:middle
So, as I just mentioned, we need


00:13:58.336 --> 00:14:00.026 A:middle
So, as I just mentioned, we need

00:14:00.026 --> 00:14:00.976 A:middle
to conform to the

00:14:01.026 --> 00:14:03.126 A:middle
QLPreviewControllerDataSource

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:03.606 A:middle
protocol.

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:06.136 A:middle
This protocol has two required

00:14:06.136 --> 00:14:07.976 A:middle
functions; one to provide data

00:14:08.126 --> 00:14:08.986 A:middle
to the Quick Look Preview

00:14:08.986 --> 00:14:09.406 A:middle
Controller.

00:14:10.206 --> 00:14:11.896 A:middle
The first being, the number of

00:14:11.896 --> 00:14:13.296 A:middle
preview items in controller.

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:16.116 A:middle
And here, you return the number

00:14:16.116 --> 00:14:17.086 A:middle
of items that your Preview

00:14:17.126 --> 00:14:18.046 A:middle
Controller should preview.

00:14:18.876 --> 00:14:20.406 A:middle
For AR Quick Look, it only

00:14:20.406 --> 00:14:21.966 A:middle
allows previewing a single

00:14:21.966 --> 00:14:23.706 A:middle
object in one dedicated session,

00:14:24.006 --> 00:14:25.446 A:middle
and so we returned the one item.

00:14:26.526 --> 00:14:27.696 A:middle
The second function we're

00:14:27.696 --> 00:14:28.906 A:middle
implementing is

00:14:29.186 --> 00:14:30.196 A:middle
PreviewController

00:14:30.596 --> 00:14:32.306 A:middle
previewItemAtindex.

00:14:32.886 --> 00:14:34.396 A:middle
And here, you returned the one

00:14:34.436 --> 00:14:35.826 A:middle
item that we we're requesting to

00:14:35.826 --> 00:14:36.376 A:middle
be previewed.

00:14:37.136 --> 00:14:38.486 A:middle
This is the URL where to find a

00:14:38.486 --> 00:14:40.176 A:middle
3D object on disk.

00:14:41.576 --> 00:14:43.686 A:middle
Now, this should look very

00:14:43.686 --> 00:14:45.646 A:middle
familiar to a lot of you, and

00:14:45.646 --> 00:14:46.716 A:middle
this is because we're using a

00:14:46.716 --> 00:14:48.276 A:middle
very similar data source and

00:14:48.276 --> 00:14:51.566 A:middle
delicate pattern from UIKit like

00:14:52.456 --> 00:14:52.766 A:middle
Table Views.

00:14:52.946 --> 00:14:54.166 A:middle
So, moving to the protocol for

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:55.506 A:middle
that delegate, there are a few

00:14:55.506 --> 00:14:57.486 A:middle
ways to present the preview.

00:14:57.486 --> 00:14:59.276 A:middle
AR Quick Look is intended to be

00:14:59.326 --> 00:15:00.356 A:middle
presented full screen.


00:14:59.326 --> 00:15:00.356 A:middle
presented full screen.

00:15:01.306 --> 00:15:02.506 A:middle
To share the same consistent

00:15:02.506 --> 00:15:04.166 A:middle
experience with AR Quick Look, I

00:15:04.166 --> 00:15:05.316 A:middle
recommend you configure your

00:15:05.316 --> 00:15:06.336 A:middle
Quick Look PreviewController's

00:15:06.336 --> 00:15:08.426 A:middle
appearance to have the same zoom

00:15:08.426 --> 00:15:09.346 A:middle
transition animation.

00:15:09.846 --> 00:15:11.576 A:middle
So when the file's up, you can

00:15:11.576 --> 00:15:12.646 A:middle
see the nice transition from the

00:15:12.646 --> 00:15:16.096 A:middle
thumbnail view to the viewer and

00:15:16.206 --> 00:15:17.576 A:middle
back down as it goes down for

00:15:17.576 --> 00:15:17.986 A:middle
dismissal.

00:15:19.806 --> 00:15:21.616 A:middle
In code, the easiest and

00:15:21.616 --> 00:15:22.796 A:middle
recommended way to achieve this

00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:24.196 A:middle
effect is to implement

00:15:24.636 --> 00:15:26.276 A:middle
PreviewController, controller

00:15:26.506 --> 00:15:28.546 A:middle
transitionViewfor item and

00:15:28.546 --> 00:15:29.476 A:middle
return a UIView.

00:15:30.376 --> 00:15:31.986 A:middle
So, Quick Look does all of the

00:15:31.986 --> 00:15:33.926 A:middle
heavy work here for you and uses

00:15:33.926 --> 00:15:35.466 A:middle
the UIView to infer the

00:15:35.466 --> 00:15:36.546 A:middle
rectangular frame that the

00:15:36.546 --> 00:15:38.276 A:middle
animation should start from when

00:15:38.276 --> 00:15:40.816 A:middle
presenting and ending when

00:15:40.816 --> 00:15:41.276 A:middle
dismissing.

00:15:42.216 --> 00:15:44.206 A:middle
If possible, I suggest the final

00:15:44.436 --> 00:15:46.126 A:middle
or UIView to have a square

00:15:46.126 --> 00:15:48.436 A:middle
frame, to have the best seamless

00:15:48.436 --> 00:15:48.926 A:middle
transition.

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:51.746 A:middle
AR Quick Look nicely handles the

00:15:51.746 --> 00:15:53.506 A:middle
transition from this view to the

00:15:53.506 --> 00:15:54.606 A:middle
full screen viewer on

00:15:54.606 --> 00:15:56.696 A:middle
presentation and dismissal,

00:15:57.086 --> 00:15:58.356 A:middle
creating this effect where the

00:15:58.356 --> 00:16:00.166 A:middle
model just magically appears.


00:15:58.356 --> 00:16:00.166 A:middle
model just magically appears.

00:16:01.186 --> 00:16:02.486 A:middle
And for an overall better

00:16:02.486 --> 00:16:05.086 A:middle
experience, I recommend using a

00:16:05.086 --> 00:16:07.726 A:middle
UI button as the view and

00:16:07.726 --> 00:16:09.206 A:middle
setting the thumbnail as the

00:16:09.256 --> 00:16:10.086 A:middle
button's image.

00:16:10.856 --> 00:16:12.176 A:middle
That way, you get visual

00:16:12.176 --> 00:16:13.926 A:middle
feedback whenever the view is

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:14.966 A:middle
tapped with the button

00:16:15.026 --> 00:16:16.806 A:middle
highlight, and this is extremely

00:16:16.806 --> 00:16:18.516 A:middle
important so that the user knows

00:16:18.516 --> 00:16:20.016 A:middle
that some action is about to

00:16:20.016 --> 00:16:20.326 A:middle
happen.

00:16:23.126 --> 00:16:24.376 A:middle
And that is how to integrate AR

00:16:24.376 --> 00:16:25.866 A:middle
Quick Look into your iOS

00:16:25.866 --> 00:16:26.426 A:middle
application.

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:28.296 A:middle
It's never been easier to

00:16:28.296 --> 00:16:29.386 A:middle
introduce AR preview and

00:16:29.386 --> 00:16:34.086 A:middle
capabilities in your apps today.

00:16:34.606 --> 00:16:35.506 A:middle
Now, let's talk about

00:16:35.506 --> 00:16:37.016 A:middle
integrating AR content on the

00:16:37.016 --> 00:16:37.296 A:middle
web.

00:16:38.076 --> 00:16:40.016 A:middle
We really want AR content to be

00:16:40.016 --> 00:16:41.356 A:middle
accessible online.

00:16:42.556 --> 00:16:45.056 A:middle
So, starting in iOS 12, Safari

00:16:45.056 --> 00:16:46.246 A:middle
has built-in support for

00:16:46.346 --> 00:16:48.976 A:middle
previewing usdz files in AR.

00:16:49.886 --> 00:16:51.586 A:middle
By hosting usdz files on your

00:16:51.586 --> 00:16:52.726 A:middle
website, you got a way of

00:16:52.726 --> 00:16:54.556 A:middle
delivering previews of 3D

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:55.056 A:middle
objects.

00:16:55.636 --> 00:16:56.936 A:middle
So, not only can you read about

00:16:56.936 --> 00:16:58.366 A:middle
the object and see it through

00:16:58.366 --> 00:16:59.556 A:middle
the image, you can now

00:16:59.556 --> 00:17:01.246 A:middle
experience what the model looks


00:16:59.556 --> 00:17:01.246 A:middle
experience what the model looks

00:17:01.246 --> 00:17:01.936 A:middle
like in your world.

00:17:02.936 --> 00:17:04.896 A:middle
So, here, I have a modern

00:17:04.896 --> 00:17:06.056 A:middle
version of my online garden

00:17:06.056 --> 00:17:08.006 A:middle
store with various thumbnails of

00:17:08.006 --> 00:17:08.945 A:middle
gardening tools I have listed

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:09.296 A:middle
for sale.

00:17:10.626 --> 00:17:11.965 A:middle
For better integration of AR on

00:17:11.965 --> 00:17:13.836 A:middle
my web content, I'll use the new

00:17:13.836 --> 00:17:15.146 A:middle
HTML markup that I'm about to

00:17:15.146 --> 00:17:15.826 A:middle
show you shortly.

00:17:16.576 --> 00:17:17.756 A:middle
This opens up and allows

00:17:17.756 --> 00:17:19.036 A:middle
customers to preview my

00:17:19.086 --> 00:17:20.715 A:middle
gardening tools before they

00:17:20.715 --> 00:17:21.616 A:middle
actually purchase it.

00:17:23.165 --> 00:17:24.576 A:middle
So, by following this markup,

00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:26.046 A:middle
you had a badge that I mentioned

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:27.646 A:middle
earlier, rendered on the image

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:28.606 A:middle
in the top right-hand corner,

00:17:28.946 --> 00:17:30.706 A:middle
and this is useful and there to

00:17:30.786 --> 00:17:32.076 A:middle
tell you that our system viewer

00:17:32.076 --> 00:17:33.506 A:middle
is behind this so you can

00:17:33.506 --> 00:17:35.246 A:middle
preview my watering can in AR.

00:17:35.996 --> 00:17:39.036 A:middle
So, you can provide your own

00:17:39.076 --> 00:17:40.636 A:middle
cover artwork associated to the

00:17:40.636 --> 00:17:41.996 A:middle
3D object, and this can be a

00:17:42.086 --> 00:17:43.996 A:middle
portrait shot or nice hero image

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:45.176 A:middle
like I've chosen for my lovely

00:17:45.176 --> 00:17:45.926 A:middle
watering can.

00:17:46.956 --> 00:17:48.626 A:middle
And with this flow, we support

00:17:48.626 --> 00:17:53.066 A:middle
drag and drop and, of course,

00:17:53.556 --> 00:17:55.446 A:middle
long-press Safari actions from

00:17:55.446 --> 00:17:57.356 A:middle
Safari like Add to Reading List

00:17:57.896 --> 00:17:58.886 A:middle
or Copy and Share.


00:18:02.196 --> 00:18:03.946 A:middle
And the best part is you get a

00:18:03.946 --> 00:18:05.766 A:middle
more immediate and optimized

00:18:05.766 --> 00:18:07.626 A:middle
workflow into AR Quick Look.

00:18:08.226 --> 00:18:09.276 A:middle
So, you're not following any

00:18:09.276 --> 00:18:11.246 A:middle
links, and you get a response

00:18:11.246 --> 00:18:13.286 A:middle
without updating your web URL.

00:18:16.556 --> 00:18:17.866 A:middle
The HTML Markup is very

00:18:17.866 --> 00:18:19.256 A:middle
straightforward and simple, and

00:18:19.256 --> 00:18:19.736 A:middle
this is it.

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:22.076 A:middle
So, by adding this attribute,

00:18:22.076 --> 00:18:23.956 A:middle
this will turn your webpage into

00:18:24.126 --> 00:18:25.266 A:middle
an AR experience.

00:18:25.856 --> 00:18:27.406 A:middle
The requirement is an a elements

00:18:27.526 --> 00:18:29.756 A:middle
with rel=ar, and this tells

00:18:29.756 --> 00:18:31.706 A:middle
WebKit that this is AR content.

00:18:32.796 --> 00:18:34.646 A:middle
You then provide the link to the

00:18:34.646 --> 00:18:36.496 A:middle
location of the usdz file.

00:18:38.296 --> 00:18:40.376 A:middle
Lastly, we have a single child

00:18:40.666 --> 00:18:42.636 A:middle
that is the image element, and

00:18:42.636 --> 00:18:43.936 A:middle
this is the cover artwork that I

00:18:43.936 --> 00:18:45.576 A:middle
mentioned earlier about that you

00:18:45.576 --> 00:18:47.326 A:middle
provide as your thumbnail for

00:18:47.326 --> 00:18:48.206 A:middle
the 3D content.

00:18:49.676 --> 00:18:50.766 A:middle
The badge will appear above your

00:18:50.766 --> 00:18:52.606 A:middle
thumbnail image inviting you to

00:18:52.826 --> 00:18:54.046 A:middle
preview and it screens the

00:18:54.046 --> 00:18:55.496 A:middle
object in AR.

00:18:56.146 --> 00:18:59.026 A:middle
And this can also be done with

00:18:59.026 --> 00:18:59.696 A:middle
the picture element.


00:19:00.566 --> 00:19:01.886 A:middle
Similar to the image element,

00:19:02.036 --> 00:19:03.446 A:middle
the rules here are single

00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:06.076 A:middle
picture child of the a rel=ar

00:19:06.076 --> 00:19:06.386 A:middle
tag.

00:19:07.216 --> 00:19:09.476 A:middle
The picture itself can have all

00:19:09.476 --> 00:19:10.676 A:middle
the children it needs, from

00:19:10.676 --> 00:19:12.916 A:middle
being very simple to having very

00:19:12.916 --> 00:19:14.326 A:middle
complicated roles about which

00:19:14.326 --> 00:19:15.626 A:middle
child source image it picks to

00:19:15.626 --> 00:19:17.496 A:middle
render based off of device,

00:19:18.516 --> 00:19:20.756 A:middle
size, and other platform logic.

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.516 A:middle
usdz content must be served with

00:19:25.516 --> 00:19:27.386 A:middle
the correct media type, and so

00:19:27.386 --> 00:19:28.896 A:middle
make sure that the MIME type is

00:19:28.896 --> 00:19:30.136 A:middle
set for these files.

00:19:30.856 --> 00:19:32.366 A:middle
The registration of an official

00:19:32.366 --> 00:19:33.536 A:middle
type is in progress.

00:19:33.796 --> 00:19:35.376 A:middle
So, in the meantime, WebKit is

00:19:35.416 --> 00:19:36.986 A:middle
affecting both of these media

00:19:37.066 --> 00:19:40.096 A:middle
types if you're using Apache.

00:19:42.736 --> 00:19:43.896 A:middle
And that's how to integrate AR

00:19:43.896 --> 00:19:44.386 A:middle
Quick Look.

00:19:44.876 --> 00:19:46.276 A:middle
The goal was to make it really

00:19:46.276 --> 00:19:48.356 A:middle
easy to put AR everywhere, on

00:19:48.356 --> 00:19:50.546 A:middle
not just websites in Safari but

00:19:50.546 --> 00:19:52.026 A:middle
also in apps in iOS.

00:19:52.796 --> 00:19:54.006 A:middle
Now, you might be wondering

00:19:54.496 --> 00:19:56.676 A:middle
where can I get usdz content.

00:19:57.406 --> 00:19:58.606 A:middle
I'll invite my colleague Dave

00:19:58.606 --> 00:19:59.576 A:middle
who will talk more about how to

00:19:59.576 --> 00:20:01.236 A:middle
create content for AR Quick


00:19:59.576 --> 00:20:01.236 A:middle
create content for AR Quick

00:20:01.236 --> 00:20:01.336 A:middle
Look.

00:20:02.516 --> 00:20:07.066 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:07.566 --> 00:20:08.106 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks David.

00:20:08.646 --> 00:20:10.356 A:middle
Well, let's start by taking a

00:20:10.356 --> 00:20:11.726 A:middle
look at what it is that we want

00:20:11.726 --> 00:20:13.246 A:middle
to achieve with our 3D models.

00:20:14.066 --> 00:20:15.866 A:middle
Here, I have a model of a teapot

00:20:15.976 --> 00:20:17.506 A:middle
that I've loaded in AR Quick

00:20:17.506 --> 00:20:19.256 A:middle
Look, and we can see that it

00:20:19.256 --> 00:20:20.976 A:middle
sits perfectly on the ground, as

00:20:20.976 --> 00:20:21.966 A:middle
indicated by its shadow.

00:20:22.736 --> 00:20:24.166 A:middle
It spins around its natural

00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:25.356 A:middle
pivot point, the center of the

00:20:25.356 --> 00:20:27.536 A:middle
bowl, and if I place it in the

00:20:27.536 --> 00:20:29.466 A:middle
world, we can really believe

00:20:29.566 --> 00:20:30.786 A:middle
that it's there on the surface

00:20:30.786 --> 00:20:31.416 A:middle
in front of me.

00:20:31.756 --> 00:20:33.456 A:middle
We even see the environment

00:20:33.456 --> 00:20:34.776 A:middle
reflected in its shiny metal

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:35.076 A:middle
handle.

00:20:35.666 --> 00:20:37.786 A:middle
So, how do we achieve this

00:20:37.786 --> 00:20:39.166 A:middle
effect with our 3D models?

00:20:40.426 --> 00:20:41.606 A:middle
Well, when we're creating our

00:20:41.606 --> 00:20:43.326 A:middle
models, there are six things we

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:44.576 A:middle
need to get right, and we'll see

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:45.826 A:middle
how to do each of these in the

00:20:45.826 --> 00:20:46.616 A:middle
remainder of the session.

00:20:47.726 --> 00:20:48.566 A:middle
We need to set the model's

00:20:48.646 --> 00:20:51.766 A:middle
placement, we need to set its

00:20:51.766 --> 00:20:53.196 A:middle
physical size to be correct in

00:20:53.196 --> 00:20:55.316 A:middle
AR, we need to create any

00:20:55.316 --> 00:20:56.806 A:middle
animation we want for our model,

00:20:57.646 --> 00:21:00.126 A:middle
add its contact shadow, modify


00:20:57.646 --> 00:21:00.126 A:middle
add its contact shadow, modify

00:21:00.126 --> 00:21:02.096 A:middle
its appearance, and then add any

00:21:02.096 --> 00:21:03.256 A:middle
transparency that our model

00:21:03.256 --> 00:21:03.706 A:middle
needs.

00:21:04.226 --> 00:21:05.676 A:middle
Once these six things are done,

00:21:06.226 --> 00:21:07.666 A:middle
we can optimize and export our

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:10.126 A:middle
models for use in AR Quick Look.

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:12.836 A:middle
We'll start with placement, and

00:21:12.956 --> 00:21:14.236 A:middle
there are three things we need

00:21:14.236 --> 00:21:15.936 A:middle
to get right in our 3D software

00:21:16.176 --> 00:21:17.076 A:middle
to make our model appear

00:21:17.076 --> 00:21:17.846 A:middle
correctly in the world.

00:21:19.226 --> 00:21:20.536 A:middle
The first is that the object

00:21:20.536 --> 00:21:21.916 A:middle
should face toward the camera,

00:21:22.146 --> 00:21:23.046 A:middle
toward positive z.

00:21:24.276 --> 00:21:25.986 A:middle
Secondly, the base of the object

00:21:25.986 --> 00:21:27.406 A:middle
should sit on the ground plane,

00:21:27.666 --> 00:21:29.096 A:middle
the plane where y = 0.

00:21:30.356 --> 00:21:31.566 A:middle
And finally, we should put its

00:21:31.566 --> 00:21:33.186 A:middle
natural pivot point at the

00:21:33.186 --> 00:21:33.576 A:middle
origin.

00:21:34.746 --> 00:21:36.216 A:middle
So, let's see how that looks for

00:21:36.216 --> 00:21:36.896 A:middle
a sample model.

00:21:37.436 --> 00:21:38.896 A:middle
Here, I'm in my 3D modeling

00:21:38.896 --> 00:21:39.326 A:middle
software.

00:21:39.936 --> 00:21:41.426 A:middle
I have the origin at the center.

00:21:42.266 --> 00:21:43.876 A:middle
I have positive x heading off to

00:21:43.876 --> 00:21:46.186 A:middle
the side, positive y heading up

00:21:46.186 --> 00:21:48.216 A:middle
from the origin, and positive z

00:21:48.296 --> 00:21:51.166 A:middle
toward the camera.

00:21:51.166 --> 00:21:52.706 A:middle
Now, if I import a model, if I

00:21:52.706 --> 00:21:54.186 A:middle
import my teapot without having

00:21:54.186 --> 00:21:55.936 A:middle
set it up, we can immediately

00:21:55.936 --> 00:21:56.936 A:middle
see there's a problem here.

00:21:57.276 --> 00:21:59.126 A:middle
The model is below the ground

00:21:59.156 --> 00:21:59.326 A:middle
plane.


00:22:00.496 --> 00:22:01.676 A:middle
If we look at it from the side,

00:22:01.816 --> 00:22:02.936 A:middle
we can see this model has been

00:22:02.936 --> 00:22:04.236 A:middle
created around the origin.

00:22:05.156 --> 00:22:06.746 A:middle
So, let's move it up such that

00:22:06.746 --> 00:22:08.346 A:middle
its base is set on our plane

00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:09.366 A:middle
where y = 0.

00:22:09.666 --> 00:22:10.906 A:middle
And now, it's ready to position

00:22:10.906 --> 00:22:11.956 A:middle
in the world on the ground.

00:22:13.956 --> 00:22:15.046 A:middle
If we look at it from the front,

00:22:15.046 --> 00:22:16.686 A:middle
however, there are still some

00:22:16.686 --> 00:22:17.986 A:middle
esthetic improvements we can

00:22:17.986 --> 00:22:18.426 A:middle
make here.

00:22:18.696 --> 00:22:20.056 A:middle
This kind of looks like a

00:22:20.056 --> 00:22:21.866 A:middle
teapot, but it could look more

00:22:21.866 --> 00:22:22.376 A:middle
like a teapot.

00:22:23.576 --> 00:22:24.766 A:middle
This is what we think of when we

00:22:24.766 --> 00:22:26.096 A:middle
think of a teapot, with a spout

00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:26.586 A:middle
to the side.

00:22:28.086 --> 00:22:28.886 A:middle
When you're thinking how to

00:22:28.886 --> 00:22:30.126 A:middle
position your objects for this

00:22:30.156 --> 00:22:32.026 A:middle
optimal recognition, think how

00:22:32.026 --> 00:22:33.366 A:middle
you would place that object if

00:22:33.366 --> 00:22:34.786 A:middle
you put it on a shelf or in a

00:22:34.786 --> 00:22:35.556 A:middle
display cabinet.

00:22:36.786 --> 00:22:39.196 A:middle
If in doubt, ask a young child

00:22:39.356 --> 00:22:40.606 A:middle
to draw the object for you.

00:22:41.286 --> 00:22:42.416 A:middle
Chances are the profile they

00:22:42.416 --> 00:22:43.496 A:middle
choose is the one you should

00:22:43.496 --> 00:22:43.766 A:middle
use.

00:22:44.326 --> 00:22:46.686 A:middle
Now, this profile really

00:22:46.686 --> 00:22:47.106 A:middle
matters.

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:49.156 A:middle
Not only is it what people will

00:22:49.156 --> 00:22:50.836 A:middle
see when your object first loads

00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:52.756 A:middle
in our Quick Look, but it's also

00:22:52.756 --> 00:22:53.876 A:middle
the profile that's used for the

00:22:53.876 --> 00:22:55.506 A:middle
object's thumbnail, and these

00:22:55.506 --> 00:22:57.056 A:middle
two deliberately match when the

00:22:57.056 --> 00:22:58.266 A:middle
thumbnail is in files or in

00:22:58.266 --> 00:22:58.816 A:middle
messages.

00:22:59.056 --> 00:22:59.976 A:middle
So, we get that seamless

00:22:59.976 --> 00:23:01.206 A:middle
transition between the two.


00:22:59.976 --> 00:23:01.206 A:middle
transition between the two.

00:23:01.886 --> 00:23:03.086 A:middle
So, choosing a good profile is

00:23:03.136 --> 00:23:03.786 A:middle
really important.

00:23:04.196 --> 00:23:07.076 A:middle
We'll head back into our 3D

00:23:07.076 --> 00:23:09.316 A:middle
software and rotate our model so

00:23:09.316 --> 00:23:10.346 A:middle
the spout is to the side.

00:23:11.596 --> 00:23:13.386 A:middle
As one final check before we

00:23:13.386 --> 00:23:15.446 A:middle
export it, let's take a top-down

00:23:15.446 --> 00:23:16.826 A:middle
view and make sure that that

00:23:16.826 --> 00:23:18.496 A:middle
bowl is centered on the origin,

00:23:18.676 --> 00:23:19.796 A:middle
so it will spin around the point

00:23:19.796 --> 00:23:22.636 A:middle
we want it to.

00:23:22.866 --> 00:23:24.276 A:middle
The second thing we want to set

00:23:24.276 --> 00:23:25.996 A:middle
up for our model is its physical

00:23:25.996 --> 00:23:26.456 A:middle
size.

00:23:27.306 --> 00:23:28.916 A:middle
Here, I have a gramophone record

00:23:28.916 --> 00:23:30.706 A:middle
player, and size matters here.

00:23:31.256 --> 00:23:32.406 A:middle
This record player is designed

00:23:32.406 --> 00:23:34.086 A:middle
to play 12-inch records, so we

00:23:34.086 --> 00:23:35.106 A:middle
need to make sure it's the right

00:23:35.106 --> 00:23:35.786 A:middle
size in the world.

00:23:36.236 --> 00:23:38.976 A:middle
If I export this model and load

00:23:38.976 --> 00:23:40.766 A:middle
it in object mode in AR Quick

00:23:40.766 --> 00:23:42.496 A:middle
Look, it looks great because we

00:23:42.496 --> 00:23:43.756 A:middle
always scale models to fit in

00:23:43.756 --> 00:23:44.146 A:middle
this mode.

00:23:44.906 --> 00:23:46.126 A:middle
But if I place it in the world,

00:23:46.606 --> 00:23:47.576 A:middle
we can see there's a problem

00:23:47.706 --> 00:23:49.136 A:middle
when I put it next to a 12-inch

00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:49.496 A:middle
record.

00:23:50.006 --> 00:23:50.806 A:middle
It's far too small.

00:23:51.486 --> 00:23:52.786 A:middle
Right now, it's set up to play

00:23:52.786 --> 00:23:54.416 A:middle
6-inch records, and they don't

00:23:54.416 --> 00:23:54.836 A:middle
exist.

00:23:56.446 --> 00:23:58.226 A:middle
So, let's head back into my 3D

00:23:58.226 --> 00:24:00.306 A:middle
software and create a reference,


00:23:58.226 --> 00:24:00.306 A:middle
software and create a reference,

00:24:00.406 --> 00:24:01.566 A:middle
12-inch cylinder.

00:24:02.326 --> 00:24:04.016 A:middle
Now, I know this is exactly 12

00:24:04.016 --> 00:24:05.636 A:middle
inches in diameter because I

00:24:05.636 --> 00:24:06.956 A:middle
know the units that this project

00:24:06.956 --> 00:24:07.506 A:middle
is working in.

00:24:08.866 --> 00:24:09.896 A:middle
I can use this reference

00:24:09.896 --> 00:24:11.916 A:middle
cylinder to resize my turntable

00:24:12.386 --> 00:24:13.676 A:middle
and make sure that the platter

00:24:13.676 --> 00:24:15.196 A:middle
is exactly the right size to

00:24:15.196 --> 00:24:16.806 A:middle
play a 12-inch record.

00:24:17.376 --> 00:24:19.316 A:middle
Having done so, if I re-export

00:24:19.316 --> 00:24:21.156 A:middle
my model, it looks exactly the

00:24:21.156 --> 00:24:22.646 A:middle
same in object mode because it's

00:24:22.646 --> 00:24:23.646 A:middle
still scaled to fit.

00:24:23.736 --> 00:24:25.236 A:middle
But when I place it in the

00:24:25.236 --> 00:24:27.136 A:middle
world, we can now see it's the

00:24:27.136 --> 00:24:28.796 A:middle
right size to play this 12-inch

00:24:28.796 --> 00:24:29.146 A:middle
record.

00:24:29.596 --> 00:24:30.776 A:middle
We could imagine picking it up

00:24:30.776 --> 00:24:31.656 A:middle
and placing it on that

00:24:31.656 --> 00:24:31.976 A:middle
turntable.

00:24:34.346 --> 00:24:37.206 A:middle
Now, not all objects have a

00:24:37.206 --> 00:24:38.206 A:middle
natural size.

00:24:39.026 --> 00:24:40.506 A:middle
This little guy is Chatterbox,

00:24:40.666 --> 00:24:42.026 A:middle
and he doesn't exist in the real

00:24:42.026 --> 00:24:42.296 A:middle
world.

00:24:42.746 --> 00:24:43.536 A:middle
He only exists in our

00:24:43.536 --> 00:24:44.196 A:middle
imaginations.

00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:46.306 A:middle
But he's pretty cute, and he has

00:24:46.306 --> 00:24:47.866 A:middle
a fun animation, and he's good

00:24:47.866 --> 00:24:48.836 A:middle
to take a photo with.

00:24:49.756 --> 00:24:51.456 A:middle
So, we've created him at desktop

00:24:51.456 --> 00:24:53.196 A:middle
size, which makes him easy to

00:24:53.196 --> 00:24:54.396 A:middle
place in the world in common

00:24:54.396 --> 00:24:56.756 A:middle
environments, then people can

00:24:56.756 --> 00:24:58.586 A:middle
resize him, shrink him down.

00:24:58.906 --> 00:24:59.956 A:middle
They can move him around or

00:24:59.956 --> 00:25:01.296 A:middle
scale him up and make him the


00:24:59.956 --> 00:25:01.296 A:middle
scale him up and make him the

00:25:01.296 --> 00:25:02.466 A:middle
size they want him to be for a

00:25:02.466 --> 00:25:02.916 A:middle
photo.

00:25:03.866 --> 00:25:05.216 A:middle
But by making him desktop size

00:25:05.216 --> 00:25:06.986 A:middle
by default, he's always easy to

00:25:06.986 --> 00:25:07.406 A:middle
place.

00:25:09.916 --> 00:25:11.886 A:middle
We saw here that Chatterbox has

00:25:12.066 --> 00:25:13.986 A:middle
animation, and this is something

00:25:13.986 --> 00:25:15.236 A:middle
we recommend you use where it

00:25:15.236 --> 00:25:16.536 A:middle
helps to bring that object to

00:25:16.536 --> 00:25:18.386 A:middle
life with an idle animation that

00:25:18.386 --> 00:25:19.506 A:middle
makes it feel more like it's in

00:25:19.506 --> 00:25:19.906 A:middle
the world.

00:25:20.426 --> 00:25:23.266 A:middle
Note that animations always

00:25:23.266 --> 00:25:25.556 A:middle
loop, and the animations you

00:25:25.556 --> 00:25:26.936 A:middle
could create can use skeletal

00:25:27.106 --> 00:25:28.876 A:middle
and/or transform animation to

00:25:28.876 --> 00:25:30.906 A:middle
bring them to life.

00:25:31.046 --> 00:25:32.136 A:middle
Here's another example.

00:25:32.586 --> 00:25:34.166 A:middle
This is a cartoon style chicken

00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:36.406 A:middle
character without animation, and

00:25:36.506 --> 00:25:38.276 A:middle
if I place him in the world, he

00:25:38.276 --> 00:25:40.276 A:middle
looks pretty cool, but he's kind

00:25:40.406 --> 00:25:40.756 A:middle
of static.

00:25:40.756 --> 00:25:42.146 A:middle
He doesn't really feel like he's

00:25:42.146 --> 00:25:43.446 A:middle
alive there in the room with me.

00:25:44.216 --> 00:25:45.926 A:middle
So, there's more we can do here.

00:25:46.676 --> 00:25:48.426 A:middle
So, if we add a little bit of

00:25:48.426 --> 00:25:49.686 A:middle
skeletal animation to our

00:25:49.686 --> 00:25:50.956 A:middle
character to make him bob his

00:25:51.026 --> 00:25:53.376 A:middle
head, now when we place him in

00:25:53.376 --> 00:25:55.036 A:middle
the world, he feels much more

00:25:55.036 --> 00:25:56.286 A:middle
realistic, much more like he's

00:25:56.286 --> 00:25:58.106 A:middle
there on the table in front of

00:25:59.656 --> 00:25:59.736 A:middle
me.

00:25:59.986 --> 00:26:01.716 A:middle
Some tips as you add animation


00:25:59.986 --> 00:26:01.716 A:middle
Some tips as you add animation

00:26:01.716 --> 00:26:02.306 A:middle
to your models.

00:26:03.026 --> 00:26:04.986 A:middle
Firstly, choose animations that

00:26:04.986 --> 00:26:06.796 A:middle
enhance the AR immersiveness,

00:26:06.856 --> 00:26:07.946 A:middle
that make you feel more like

00:26:07.946 --> 00:26:08.876 A:middle
that object is there in the

00:26:08.876 --> 00:26:08.976 A:middle
room.

00:26:10.396 --> 00:26:11.826 A:middle
Now, because people can

00:26:11.826 --> 00:26:13.306 A:middle
manipulate your objects, they

00:26:13.306 --> 00:26:14.996 A:middle
can retape them, scale them, and

00:26:14.996 --> 00:26:17.206 A:middle
move them around, it's important

00:26:17.206 --> 00:26:18.296 A:middle
not to move them away from the

00:26:18.296 --> 00:26:18.696 A:middle
origin.

00:26:19.586 --> 00:26:21.306 A:middle
If I create a car that zooms

00:26:21.306 --> 00:26:22.806 A:middle
around in a meter-wide circle,

00:26:23.486 --> 00:26:24.386 A:middle
when someone tries to put their

00:26:24.386 --> 00:26:25.566 A:middle
finger on that car to pick it

00:26:25.566 --> 00:26:27.176 A:middle
up, it's already moved away and

00:26:27.176 --> 00:26:28.026 A:middle
zooms somewhere else.

00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:29.256 A:middle
So, that gesture is very

00:26:29.256 --> 00:26:30.576 A:middle
confusing to somebody trying to

00:26:30.576 --> 00:26:31.496 A:middle
manipulate that object.

00:26:32.106 --> 00:26:33.306 A:middle
So, try and keep those objects

00:26:33.306 --> 00:26:34.156 A:middle
centered at the origin.

00:26:34.686 --> 00:26:37.536 A:middle
For the same reasons, try and

00:26:37.536 --> 00:26:39.176 A:middle
keep a consistent bounding box

00:26:39.176 --> 00:26:40.096 A:middle
throughout the animation as

00:26:40.096 --> 00:26:40.316 A:middle
well.

00:26:40.856 --> 00:26:42.016 A:middle
Even if the object is at one

00:26:42.016 --> 00:26:44.036 A:middle
location, it's much easier for

00:26:44.036 --> 00:26:45.606 A:middle
me to manipulate it if it stays

00:26:45.606 --> 00:26:46.496 A:middle
in the same place under my

00:26:46.496 --> 00:26:48.116 A:middle
fingers throughout the entire

00:26:48.116 --> 00:26:48.496 A:middle
gesture.

00:26:50.586 --> 00:26:53.016 A:middle
As a result, prefer animations

00:26:53.016 --> 00:26:54.446 A:middle
that make sense at a static

00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:54.936 A:middle
location.

00:26:55.916 --> 00:26:57.516 A:middle
If you have a T-rex character,

00:26:57.516 --> 00:26:59.256 A:middle
rather than giving it a walk

00:26:59.256 --> 00:27:00.656 A:middle
cycle that would make it look


00:26:59.256 --> 00:27:00.656 A:middle
cycle that would make it look

00:27:00.656 --> 00:27:01.706 A:middle
like it was running on the spot,

00:27:02.336 --> 00:27:03.946 A:middle
make it roar or stamp its feet

00:27:04.406 --> 00:27:05.316 A:middle
or something else that makes

00:27:05.316 --> 00:27:06.526 A:middle
sense at a static location.

00:27:07.106 --> 00:27:09.396 A:middle
Now, there is an alternative.

00:27:10.076 --> 00:27:11.826 A:middle
You can also consider creating

00:27:11.826 --> 00:27:13.216 A:middle
animations as self-contained

00:27:13.216 --> 00:27:14.636 A:middle
scenes to help with these

00:27:14.636 --> 00:27:15.636 A:middle
gesture manipulations.

00:27:16.046 --> 00:27:17.256 A:middle
And let's see an example of how

00:27:17.256 --> 00:27:17.756 A:middle
that can work.

00:27:18.806 --> 00:27:20.566 A:middle
Here, I have a swimming koi

00:27:20.566 --> 00:27:22.236 A:middle
fish, and it makes sense for

00:27:22.236 --> 00:27:23.176 A:middle
this fish to have some

00:27:23.176 --> 00:27:23.786 A:middle
translation.

00:27:24.406 --> 00:27:25.806 A:middle
So, we created a scene with an

00:27:25.806 --> 00:27:28.106 A:middle
aquarium base, and this means

00:27:28.106 --> 00:27:29.336 A:middle
when we place this in the world,

00:27:29.846 --> 00:27:31.986 A:middle
if we rotate it, or if we move

00:27:31.986 --> 00:27:34.256 A:middle
it, the scene we're manipulating

00:27:34.256 --> 00:27:36.566 A:middle
is the scene, not the fish, and

00:27:36.566 --> 00:27:37.916 A:middle
so the gesture makes a lot more

00:27:37.916 --> 00:27:38.176 A:middle
sense.

00:27:39.476 --> 00:27:40.916 A:middle
It also means by having a base

00:27:40.916 --> 00:27:42.156 A:middle
to our scene that we have a

00:27:42.156 --> 00:27:43.486 A:middle
consistent bounding box

00:27:43.636 --> 00:27:44.876 A:middle
throughout the entire animation.

00:27:45.326 --> 00:27:48.846 A:middle
Another thing that really brings

00:27:48.846 --> 00:27:49.996 A:middle
your models to life in the world

00:27:50.376 --> 00:27:51.576 A:middle
is that contact shadow.

00:27:52.466 --> 00:27:54.496 A:middle
Now, note here that AR Quick

00:27:54.496 --> 00:27:55.886 A:middle
Look provides the contact shadow

00:27:55.886 --> 00:27:56.386 A:middle
for you.

00:27:57.276 --> 00:27:58.536 A:middle
This means that it can turn the

00:27:58.536 --> 00:27:59.976 A:middle
shadow on and off as you

00:27:59.976 --> 00:28:00.976 A:middle
transition between modes.


00:27:59.976 --> 00:28:00.976 A:middle
transition between modes.

00:28:01.776 --> 00:28:03.196 A:middle
It also means it can apply

00:28:03.416 --> 00:28:05.116 A:middle
ambient lighting conditions to

00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:06.836 A:middle
the shadow as the lighting

00:28:06.836 --> 00:28:07.616 A:middle
changes around you.

00:28:08.816 --> 00:28:10.606 A:middle
Because of this, don't bake a

00:28:10.606 --> 00:28:12.166 A:middle
contact shadow into the models

00:28:12.166 --> 00:28:12.676 A:middle
you provide.

00:28:13.426 --> 00:28:14.626 A:middle
If you do, you'll end up with

00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:14.976 A:middle
two shadows.

00:28:17.436 --> 00:28:19.196 A:middle
Note also that the first frame

00:28:19.196 --> 00:28:20.846 A:middle
of any animation is used to

00:28:20.846 --> 00:28:22.326 A:middle
create the shadow for a model,

00:28:22.996 --> 00:28:24.596 A:middle
and sometimes this means it's

00:28:24.596 --> 00:28:25.626 A:middle
important to choose the right

00:28:25.626 --> 00:28:26.176 A:middle
first frame.

00:28:26.686 --> 00:28:29.206 A:middle
We'll see an example.

00:28:29.206 --> 00:28:30.556 A:middle
Here, I have a model of a

00:28:30.556 --> 00:28:32.536 A:middle
Newton's cradle, a desktop type,

00:28:33.096 --> 00:28:34.476 A:middle
and it has a swinging animation,

00:28:34.476 --> 00:28:35.716 A:middle
a transform animation to bring

00:28:35.716 --> 00:28:36.256 A:middle
it to life.

00:28:36.356 --> 00:28:39.356 A:middle
Now, if we freeze this with its

00:28:39.356 --> 00:28:41.176 A:middle
first frame, here the first

00:28:41.176 --> 00:28:42.046 A:middle
frame has one of the ball

00:28:42.046 --> 00:28:43.796 A:middle
bearings out to the side, we can

00:28:43.796 --> 00:28:44.586 A:middle
see there's a problem.

00:28:45.716 --> 00:28:47.106 A:middle
The shadow we've generated from

00:28:47.106 --> 00:28:48.716 A:middle
this first frame also has that

00:28:48.746 --> 00:28:49.986 A:middle
ball bearing out to the side.

00:28:50.966 --> 00:28:52.546 A:middle
And so, if we animate to the

00:28:52.546 --> 00:28:54.076 A:middle
other extreme of this animation,

00:28:54.696 --> 00:28:55.606 A:middle
at this point, the shadow

00:28:55.606 --> 00:28:58.486 A:middle
doesn't really make sense.

00:28:58.656 --> 00:29:00.686 A:middle
Now, because animations loop, we


00:28:58.656 --> 00:29:00.686 A:middle
Now, because animations loop, we

00:29:00.686 --> 00:29:01.606 A:middle
could choose a different

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:02.936 A:middle
starting point, a more neutral

00:29:02.936 --> 00:29:03.966 A:middle
one where the ball's in the

00:29:03.966 --> 00:29:06.016 A:middle
center and still have the same

00:29:06.016 --> 00:29:07.166 A:middle
animation, the same overall

00:29:07.166 --> 00:29:07.496 A:middle
effect.

00:29:08.206 --> 00:29:09.676 A:middle
But now, by choosing a better

00:29:09.676 --> 00:29:11.386 A:middle
first frame, our shadow makes

00:29:11.386 --> 00:29:12.306 A:middle
sense throughout the entire

00:29:12.306 --> 00:29:12.756 A:middle
animation.

00:29:15.656 --> 00:29:17.136 A:middle
One of the biggest things we can

00:29:17.136 --> 00:29:18.866 A:middle
modify about our model to make

00:29:18.866 --> 00:29:20.786 A:middle
it feel real in the world is the

00:29:20.786 --> 00:29:21.806 A:middle
model's appearance.

00:29:23.056 --> 00:29:25.486 A:middle
Now, here, AR Quick Look uses a

00:29:25.486 --> 00:29:27.076 A:middle
Physically Based Rendering, or

00:29:27.076 --> 00:29:29.206 A:middle
PBR shader, and this gives us

00:29:29.206 --> 00:29:30.706 A:middle
six things that we can modify

00:29:30.816 --> 00:29:32.406 A:middle
about our model's appearance to

00:29:32.406 --> 00:29:33.836 A:middle
make it feel more real in the

00:29:33.836 --> 00:29:34.146 A:middle
world.

00:29:35.096 --> 00:29:36.206 A:middle
We do this by providing

00:29:36.206 --> 00:29:37.666 A:middle
textures, images, for each of

00:29:37.666 --> 00:29:38.866 A:middle
these six things if we want to.

00:29:40.266 --> 00:29:41.996 A:middle
The first is the model's albedo.

00:29:42.476 --> 00:29:43.916 A:middle
This is the base color of the

00:29:43.916 --> 00:29:45.816 A:middle
model, its underlying color.

00:29:46.456 --> 00:29:48.486 A:middle
The second is indicating which

00:29:48.526 --> 00:29:50.076 A:middle
parts of the model are metallic.

00:29:50.706 --> 00:29:52.076 A:middle
This changes whether they are a

00:29:52.076 --> 00:29:53.836 A:middle
conductor or an insulator, which

00:29:53.836 --> 00:29:55.126 A:middle
changes how they interact with

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:56.236 A:middle
the physics of light in the real

00:29:56.236 --> 00:29:56.596 A:middle
world.

00:29:58.026 --> 00:29:59.796 A:middle
We could also specify which

00:29:59.846 --> 00:30:01.416 A:middle
parts of our model are rough or


00:29:59.846 --> 00:30:01.416 A:middle
parts of our model are rough or

00:30:01.416 --> 00:30:02.996 A:middle
shiny by providing a roughness

00:30:02.996 --> 00:30:03.366 A:middle
texture.

00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:06.246 A:middle
We can add in a normal map.

00:30:06.896 --> 00:30:08.056 A:middle
This creates the illusion of

00:30:08.116 --> 00:30:09.326 A:middle
depth and variances within the

00:30:09.326 --> 00:30:11.176 A:middle
surfaces, the model's surface,

00:30:11.426 --> 00:30:12.606 A:middle
without changing the underlying

00:30:12.606 --> 00:30:13.026 A:middle
mesh.

00:30:13.596 --> 00:30:16.086 A:middle
We can add an ambient occlusion

00:30:16.086 --> 00:30:17.896 A:middle
texture to specify where the

00:30:17.896 --> 00:30:19.746 A:middle
model casts shadows on itself in

00:30:19.746 --> 00:30:21.036 A:middle
the crevices and nooks and

00:30:21.036 --> 00:30:21.776 A:middle
crannies of the model.

00:30:23.036 --> 00:30:24.726 A:middle
And if our model emits lights,

00:30:25.066 --> 00:30:26.306 A:middle
we can provide an emissive

00:30:26.306 --> 00:30:27.916 A:middle
texture for things like a TV

00:30:27.916 --> 00:30:29.346 A:middle
screen or a computer monitor.

00:30:29.926 --> 00:30:32.276 A:middle
Now, if you're just getting

00:30:32.276 --> 00:30:34.456 A:middle
started with PBR, we have a

00:30:34.456 --> 00:30:35.886 A:middle
session on Thursday about

00:30:35.916 --> 00:30:38.006 A:middle
creating PBR-based models for

00:30:38.006 --> 00:30:39.826 A:middle
any AR experience, and I highly

00:30:39.826 --> 00:30:40.726 A:middle
recommend you check it out.

00:30:42.036 --> 00:30:43.366 A:middle
For now, we'll take a look at

00:30:43.366 --> 00:30:45.306 A:middle
how these six textures affect AR

00:30:45.306 --> 00:30:46.456 A:middle
Quick Look particularly.

00:30:47.996 --> 00:30:49.566 A:middle
So, I'll start with a model of a

00:30:49.566 --> 00:30:50.056 A:middle
TV.

00:30:50.606 --> 00:30:52.106 A:middle
Right now, it has no textures.

00:30:52.196 --> 00:30:53.586 A:middle
It's pretty bland.

00:30:55.016 --> 00:30:57.356 A:middle
We'll bring in an albedo texture

00:30:57.546 --> 00:30:59.386 A:middle
to give it some base color, and

00:30:59.386 --> 00:31:00.746 A:middle
it's much more recognizable as a


00:30:59.386 --> 00:31:00.746 A:middle
it's much more recognizable as a

00:31:00.746 --> 00:31:02.786 A:middle
TV now, but it's still very

00:31:02.786 --> 00:31:03.066 A:middle
flat.

00:31:03.346 --> 00:31:04.426 A:middle
It doesn't feel realistic.

00:31:04.426 --> 00:31:07.976 A:middle
The next thing we'll do is to

00:31:07.976 --> 00:31:10.166 A:middle
introduce a metallic texture to

00:31:10.166 --> 00:31:11.416 A:middle
make the trim around the TV

00:31:11.416 --> 00:31:13.666 A:middle
screen and the antenna on top to

00:31:13.666 --> 00:31:14.776 A:middle
indicate that they're made from

00:31:14.776 --> 00:31:15.086 A:middle
metal.

00:31:16.266 --> 00:31:17.266 A:middle
Note here that our metallic

00:31:17.266 --> 00:31:18.946 A:middle
texture is pretty much black and

00:31:18.946 --> 00:31:19.186 A:middle
white.

00:31:19.676 --> 00:31:21.166 A:middle
Things either are a metal, or

00:31:21.166 --> 00:31:21.436 A:middle
they aren't.

00:31:22.916 --> 00:31:24.206 A:middle
But the metal still doesn't look

00:31:24.206 --> 00:31:25.386 A:middle
as realistic as we want it to

00:31:25.386 --> 00:31:26.886 A:middle
do, and that's because the

00:31:26.886 --> 00:31:28.606 A:middle
metal, like all of the model, is

00:31:28.606 --> 00:31:29.766 A:middle
entirely rough.

00:31:30.056 --> 00:31:31.356 A:middle
There's no shine, there's no

00:31:31.526 --> 00:31:32.916 A:middle
smooth surfaces on this TV right

00:31:32.916 --> 00:31:32.983 A:middle
now.

00:31:35.306 --> 00:31:37.106 A:middle
To fix that, we'll bring in a

00:31:37.106 --> 00:31:39.176 A:middle
roughness texture, and at this

00:31:39.176 --> 00:31:40.316 A:middle
point the model really comes to

00:31:40.316 --> 00:31:40.626 A:middle
life.

00:31:41.656 --> 00:31:43.076 A:middle
The metal around the TV screen

00:31:43.076 --> 00:31:44.506 A:middle
and the aerial now looks like

00:31:44.506 --> 00:31:44.876 A:middle
metal.

00:31:44.876 --> 00:31:46.786 A:middle
It looks like chrome, and the

00:31:46.786 --> 00:31:48.486 A:middle
wood on the top of our TV

00:31:48.616 --> 00:31:49.646 A:middle
actually looks like it has a

00:31:49.646 --> 00:31:51.056 A:middle
varnish or lacquer effect.

00:31:51.236 --> 00:31:52.266 A:middle
We can believe it much more

00:31:52.266 --> 00:31:54.686 A:middle
realistically as a TV.

00:31:54.866 --> 00:31:55.946 A:middle
And roughness is one of the

00:31:55.946 --> 00:31:57.426 A:middle
biggest points of creative

00:31:57.426 --> 00:31:58.696 A:middle
control you have over the look

00:31:58.696 --> 00:31:59.936 A:middle
of your model and how it feels

00:31:59.936 --> 00:32:00.646 A:middle
in the real world.


00:31:59.936 --> 00:32:00.646 A:middle
in the real world.

00:32:01.186 --> 00:32:02.196 A:middle
And you'll see, we have quite a

00:32:02.196 --> 00:32:03.476 A:middle
lot of variance in our roughness

00:32:03.506 --> 00:32:04.726 A:middle
texture, even within the same

00:32:04.726 --> 00:32:06.446 A:middle
parts of the model, to give more

00:32:06.446 --> 00:32:07.516 A:middle
realism and to bring it more to

00:32:07.516 --> 00:32:07.736 A:middle
life.

00:32:10.176 --> 00:32:12.676 A:middle
Next, we'll add a normal map to

00:32:12.676 --> 00:32:14.036 A:middle
add the illusion of variance,

00:32:14.036 --> 00:32:15.866 A:middle
particularly in the woodgrain on

00:32:15.866 --> 00:32:16.846 A:middle
top of the TV here.

00:32:17.426 --> 00:32:18.376 A:middle
The underlying mesh hasn't

00:32:18.376 --> 00:32:20.286 A:middle
changed, but it feels more 3D.

00:32:20.466 --> 00:32:21.616 A:middle
Also, on the speaker grill.

00:32:22.066 --> 00:32:25.506 A:middle
Because we have some crevices

00:32:25.506 --> 00:32:26.686 A:middle
and some hidden areas on the

00:32:26.686 --> 00:32:28.076 A:middle
front of the TV that would cast

00:32:28.076 --> 00:32:29.876 A:middle
shadows on themselves, we'll add

00:32:29.876 --> 00:32:31.516 A:middle
in an ambient occlusion texture.

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:34.066 A:middle
The effect is pretty subtle, but

00:32:34.066 --> 00:32:35.206 A:middle
it does add to the depth of the

00:32:35.206 --> 00:32:36.906 A:middle
model and make it feel more real

00:32:37.106 --> 00:32:37.796 A:middle
when it's in the world.

00:32:38.366 --> 00:32:41.116 A:middle
And because this is a TV with a

00:32:41.116 --> 00:32:43.176 A:middle
screen, we'll add an emissive

00:32:43.256 --> 00:32:45.056 A:middle
texture as well to indicate that

00:32:45.056 --> 00:32:46.456 A:middle
the screen emits light into the

00:32:46.456 --> 00:32:46.786 A:middle
world.

00:32:48.076 --> 00:32:49.356 A:middle
The effect of this is best seen

00:32:49.356 --> 00:32:50.696 A:middle
when pushing the object into a

00:32:50.696 --> 00:32:51.006 A:middle
room.

00:32:51.786 --> 00:32:53.136 A:middle
Here, we can see that the main

00:32:53.136 --> 00:32:54.706 A:middle
body of the TV reflects the

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:55.876 A:middle
ambient lighting conditions of

00:32:55.876 --> 00:32:57.466 A:middle
the room it's in, but the screen

00:32:57.466 --> 00:32:58.016 A:middle
is brighter.

00:32:58.016 --> 00:33:00.746 A:middle
It's actually emitting light.


00:32:58.016 --> 00:33:00.746 A:middle
It's actually emitting light.

00:33:01.026 --> 00:33:02.266 A:middle
Emissive texture is a fairly

00:33:02.266 --> 00:33:03.606 A:middle
special case but not something

00:33:03.606 --> 00:33:04.636 A:middle
you'd use every day.

00:33:05.436 --> 00:33:06.326 A:middle
But if the object you're

00:33:06.326 --> 00:33:07.656 A:middle
modeling would glow if you

00:33:07.656 --> 00:33:09.116 A:middle
turned the lights off, it might

00:33:09.116 --> 00:33:10.056 A:middle
be a good candidate for an

00:33:10.056 --> 00:33:10.716 A:middle
emissive texture.

00:33:13.196 --> 00:33:14.446 A:middle
We can also make parts of our

00:33:14.446 --> 00:33:15.596 A:middle
models transparent.

00:33:15.596 --> 00:33:17.366 A:middle
This is useful for making

00:33:17.366 --> 00:33:18.516 A:middle
objects made out of partly

00:33:18.516 --> 00:33:19.296 A:middle
glass, for example.

00:33:19.626 --> 00:33:22.686 A:middle
If you do this, be sure to use a

00:33:22.686 --> 00:33:24.256 A:middle
separate material for the

00:33:24.256 --> 00:33:25.986 A:middle
transparent and non-transparent

00:33:25.986 --> 00:33:27.366 A:middle
parts of your model to ensure

00:33:27.366 --> 00:33:28.116 A:middle
they render correctly.

00:33:28.696 --> 00:33:31.366 A:middle
You do this by providing an

00:33:31.366 --> 00:33:32.736 A:middle
albedo texture that has the

00:33:32.736 --> 00:33:34.156 A:middle
transparency in its alpha

00:33:34.156 --> 00:33:34.536 A:middle
channel.

00:33:34.786 --> 00:33:36.666 A:middle
So, a transparent PNG file, for

00:33:36.666 --> 00:33:37.056 A:middle
example.

00:33:38.506 --> 00:33:40.046 A:middle
Note that transparency is really

00:33:40.046 --> 00:33:41.726 A:middle
intended for see-through parts

00:33:41.726 --> 00:33:43.216 A:middle
of the model, not for creating

00:33:43.216 --> 00:33:44.796 A:middle
cutouts like a leaf edge or a

00:33:44.796 --> 00:33:45.396 A:middle
butterfly wing.

00:33:45.956 --> 00:33:48.896 A:middle
We'll see this in action for our

00:33:48.996 --> 00:33:50.196 A:middle
TV model from before.

00:33:50.196 --> 00:33:52.336 A:middle
In addition to the mesh we

00:33:52.336 --> 00:33:53.596 A:middle
already have for the base of the

00:33:53.596 --> 00:33:55.806 A:middle
model, I'm going to add a second

00:33:55.806 --> 00:33:57.436 A:middle
mesh for a curved screen, a

00:33:57.436 --> 00:33:58.416 A:middle
screen cover that's made of

00:33:58.416 --> 00:34:00.346 A:middle
glass, with a slight amount of


00:33:58.416 --> 00:34:00.346 A:middle
glass, with a slight amount of

00:34:00.456 --> 00:34:01.206 A:middle
dirt on the screen.

00:34:01.736 --> 00:34:04.606 A:middle
Here's how it looks in AR Quick

00:34:04.606 --> 00:34:04.816 A:middle
Look.

00:34:05.826 --> 00:34:06.816 A:middle
We can see that the light

00:34:06.816 --> 00:34:08.016 A:middle
reflects on the screen and

00:34:08.016 --> 00:34:09.505 A:middle
shines off the curved surface,

00:34:09.786 --> 00:34:11.085 A:middle
and if we turn it to the side,

00:34:11.335 --> 00:34:12.416 A:middle
we can see the color of the

00:34:12.416 --> 00:34:13.596 A:middle
screen there as well where the

00:34:13.596 --> 00:34:15.346 A:middle
glass as some grime to it.

00:34:16.716 --> 00:34:18.255 A:middle
We achieve this by using this

00:34:18.315 --> 00:34:20.235 A:middle
kind of texture for our screen.

00:34:20.235 --> 00:34:21.426 A:middle
It's pretty simple.

00:34:21.505 --> 00:34:22.536 A:middle
It's just adding that small

00:34:22.536 --> 00:34:23.126 A:middle
amount of dirt.

00:34:23.686 --> 00:34:24.666 A:middle
But crucially, it has the

00:34:24.666 --> 00:34:25.866 A:middle
transparency in its alpha

00:34:25.866 --> 00:34:27.146 A:middle
channel to indicate that the

00:34:27.146 --> 00:34:28.346 A:middle
screen is see-through, and we

00:34:28.346 --> 00:34:29.916 A:middle
can see the main screen behind

00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:29.983 A:middle
it.

00:34:32.795 --> 00:34:33.906 A:middle
When you are setting up the

00:34:33.906 --> 00:34:35.775 A:middle
textures for these individual

00:34:35.775 --> 00:34:36.326 A:middle
properties.

00:34:36.326 --> 00:34:37.556 A:middle
These are the formats to use.

00:34:38.485 --> 00:34:41.166 A:middle
Albedo should RGB, or RBGA, if

00:34:41.166 --> 00:34:41.815 A:middle
you're also providing

00:34:41.815 --> 00:34:42.476 A:middle
transparency.

00:34:43.126 --> 00:34:44.646 A:middle
Normal and emissive should also

00:34:44.646 --> 00:34:45.146 A:middle
be RGB.

00:34:45.146 --> 00:34:47.496 A:middle
And metallic roughness and

00:34:47.496 --> 00:34:48.466 A:middle
ambient occlusion should be

00:34:48.466 --> 00:34:48.876 A:middle
Greyscale.

00:34:49.426 --> 00:34:51.896 A:middle
You can use any image format

00:34:51.896 --> 00:34:54.246 A:middle
supported on iOS, and note that

00:34:54.246 --> 00:34:55.676 A:middle
these textures should be square.

00:34:55.775 --> 00:34:56.856 A:middle
They should be powers of 2

00:34:56.856 --> 00:34:57.266 A:middle
squared.

00:34:57.266 --> 00:35:04.146 A:middle
So, 2k, 1k, 512 pixels, so on.


00:34:57.266 --> 00:35:04.146 A:middle
So, 2k, 1k, 512 pixels, so on.

00:35:04.426 --> 00:35:06.386 A:middle
David mentioned earlier that AR

00:35:06.386 --> 00:35:07.956 A:middle
Quick Look is available on all

00:35:07.956 --> 00:35:10.756 A:middle
devices that support iOS 12, and

00:35:10.756 --> 00:35:12.036 A:middle
this is actually quite a range

00:35:12.036 --> 00:35:13.176 A:middle
of devices with different

00:35:13.176 --> 00:35:13.816 A:middle
capabilities.

00:35:15.306 --> 00:35:17.856 A:middle
Now, because AR Quick Look is a

00:35:17.856 --> 00:35:20.076 A:middle
system-wide extension, this

00:35:20.076 --> 00:35:21.206 A:middle
means it has to share the

00:35:21.206 --> 00:35:22.736 A:middle
available system memory with the

00:35:22.736 --> 00:35:24.026 A:middle
applications that launch it.

00:35:24.026 --> 00:35:26.046 A:middle
And so, there's only so much

00:35:26.046 --> 00:35:27.866 A:middle
memory available to display and

00:35:27.866 --> 00:35:28.626 A:middle
load these models.

00:35:29.306 --> 00:35:32.586 A:middle
To help with this, we recommend

00:35:32.586 --> 00:35:34.366 A:middle
that you create and optimize and

00:35:34.446 --> 00:35:36.376 A:middle
test your models for high memory

00:35:36.376 --> 00:35:38.786 A:middle
devices like the iPhone 7 Plus,

00:35:39.016 --> 00:35:41.706 A:middle
8 Plus, and X, and the iPad Pro

00:35:41.966 --> 00:35:42.816 A:middle
12.9 inch.

00:35:43.916 --> 00:35:45.956 A:middle
If you do this, AR Quick Look

00:35:45.956 --> 00:35:47.736 A:middle
will dynamically downsample the

00:35:47.736 --> 00:35:49.346 A:middle
textures in your model for other

00:35:49.346 --> 00:35:50.206 A:middle
devices of different

00:35:50.206 --> 00:35:51.556 A:middle
capabilities, if needed.

00:35:52.266 --> 00:35:53.216 A:middle
This means you can make the

00:35:53.216 --> 00:35:54.626 A:middle
devices, your models look great

00:35:54.626 --> 00:35:56.076 A:middle
on those devices but still know

00:35:56.076 --> 00:35:56.776 A:middle
they'll work everywhere.

00:35:56.776 --> 00:35:59.786 A:middle
Know that the meshes and the

00:35:59.786 --> 00:36:01.156 A:middle
animations won't be modified.


00:35:59.786 --> 00:36:01.156 A:middle
animations won't be modified.

00:36:01.406 --> 00:36:02.496 A:middle
It's only the textures that will

00:36:02.496 --> 00:36:02.976 A:middle
be downsampled.

00:36:06.276 --> 00:36:07.576 A:middle
You're probably thinking at this

00:36:07.576 --> 00:36:09.506 A:middle
point, okay, so how big can my

00:36:09.506 --> 00:36:09.986 A:middle
model be?

00:36:09.986 --> 00:36:11.706 A:middle
How big and complex can my

00:36:11.706 --> 00:36:12.286 A:middle
textures be?

00:36:12.286 --> 00:36:15.146 A:middle
And the answer is there is no

00:36:15.146 --> 00:36:15.626 A:middle
one answer.

00:36:16.376 --> 00:36:17.986 A:middle
Many factors affect a model's

00:36:17.986 --> 00:36:19.786 A:middle
memory usage, its mesh, and its

00:36:19.786 --> 00:36:21.436 A:middle
animation complexity, and its

00:36:21.436 --> 00:36:22.576 A:middle
textures size and count.

00:36:23.816 --> 00:36:26.536 A:middle
But as a guide, for a model that

00:36:26.536 --> 00:36:28.716 A:middle
has a single PBR texture, using

00:36:28.716 --> 00:36:30.126 A:middle
those six textures we saw

00:36:30.126 --> 00:36:32.116 A:middle
earlier on, if you aim for about

00:36:32.336 --> 00:36:35.606 A:middle
100k polygons, one set of 2k by

00:36:35.606 --> 00:36:38.136 A:middle
2k PBR textures and about ten

00:36:38.136 --> 00:36:39.956 A:middle
seconds of animation, this is

00:36:39.956 --> 00:36:40.916 A:middle
typically good for those

00:36:40.916 --> 00:36:42.216 A:middle
high-memory devices we mentioned

00:36:42.216 --> 00:36:42.576 A:middle
earlier on.

00:36:43.156 --> 00:36:45.976 A:middle
If in doubt, always test your

00:36:45.976 --> 00:36:47.786 A:middle
model on a device to make sure

00:36:47.786 --> 00:36:49.166 A:middle
that it renders and loads as you

00:36:49.946 --> 00:36:52.116 A:middle
would expect.

00:36:52.236 --> 00:36:53.736 A:middle
As you optimize your models for

00:36:53.796 --> 00:36:55.336 A:middle
use in AR Quick Look, a few

00:36:55.336 --> 00:36:56.906 A:middle
things to keep in mind.

00:36:57.636 --> 00:36:59.316 A:middle
Do be sure to freeze any

00:36:59.316 --> 00:37:00.656 A:middle
transforms in your models and


00:36:59.316 --> 00:37:00.656 A:middle
transforms in your models and

00:37:00.656 --> 00:37:01.956 A:middle
merge any adjacent vertices to

00:37:02.196 --> 00:37:03.576 A:middle
tidy them up ready for export.

00:37:04.496 --> 00:37:06.306 A:middle
And if you can, try and use a

00:37:06.306 --> 00:37:08.086 A:middle
single material and texture set

00:37:08.086 --> 00:37:08.976 A:middle
for the entire model.

00:37:10.056 --> 00:37:11.526 A:middle
This enables you to optimize how

00:37:11.526 --> 00:37:12.866 A:middle
you pack the different parts of

00:37:12.866 --> 00:37:14.456 A:middle
that model into those square

00:37:14.456 --> 00:37:15.396 A:middle
textures that you're using.

00:37:15.926 --> 00:37:18.666 A:middle
And if you don't need a texture,

00:37:19.256 --> 00:37:21.416 A:middle
don't include it.

00:37:21.416 --> 00:37:22.256 A:middle
If none of the parts of your

00:37:22.256 --> 00:37:23.266 A:middle
model are made from metal,

00:37:23.266 --> 00:37:24.336 A:middle
there's no need to provide a

00:37:24.336 --> 00:37:25.076 A:middle
metallic texture.

00:37:25.416 --> 00:37:26.866 A:middle
The default is non-metallic for

00:37:26.866 --> 00:37:28.306 A:middle
any model that's loaded.

00:37:29.316 --> 00:37:30.846 A:middle
When you're choosing where to

00:37:30.846 --> 00:37:32.116 A:middle
spend your texture budget,

00:37:32.616 --> 00:37:34.236 A:middle
prioritize the areas that give

00:37:34.236 --> 00:37:35.876 A:middle
most realism to that model.

00:37:35.876 --> 00:37:38.046 A:middle
For some models, that might be a

00:37:38.116 --> 00:37:39.646 A:middle
high-resolution albedo texture.

00:37:40.176 --> 00:37:41.116 A:middle
For others, it might be better

00:37:41.176 --> 00:37:42.886 A:middle
spent on roughness or the normal

00:37:42.886 --> 00:37:42.976 A:middle
map.

00:37:45.136 --> 00:37:46.636 A:middle
And remember the pixels actually

00:37:46.636 --> 00:37:48.486 A:middle
have a physical size in AR.

00:37:49.656 --> 00:37:50.856 A:middle
If you're printing a model of a

00:37:50.856 --> 00:37:52.206 A:middle
thimble, and it's one inch

00:37:52.256 --> 00:37:54.566 A:middle
across, there's probably no need

00:37:54.566 --> 00:37:56.376 A:middle
to use a 2k by 2k texture for

00:37:56.376 --> 00:37:56.443 A:middle
it.

00:37:56.786 --> 00:37:58.116 A:middle
Those pixels will be tiny in the

00:37:58.116 --> 00:37:59.186 A:middle
real world.


00:38:00.586 --> 00:38:02.156 A:middle
And although we want models to

00:38:02.156 --> 00:38:03.986 A:middle
look great, we also need to

00:38:03.986 --> 00:38:05.866 A:middle
balance texture size and quality

00:38:05.866 --> 00:38:06.846 A:middle
against file size.

00:38:07.466 --> 00:38:08.496 A:middle
If a model is being downloaded

00:38:08.496 --> 00:38:10.056 A:middle
from a website, we want it to be

00:38:10.056 --> 00:38:11.646 A:middle
a good size for downloading and

00:38:11.646 --> 00:38:13.376 A:middle
also for sharing via messages

00:38:13.376 --> 00:38:15.006 A:middle
and mail and other means.

00:38:17.156 --> 00:38:18.796 A:middle
So, with all of that in mind,

00:38:19.516 --> 00:38:20.416 A:middle
how do we make these things?

00:38:21.416 --> 00:38:23.276 A:middle
Well for this, we have a usdz

00:38:23.276 --> 00:38:24.026 A:middle
Converter.

00:38:25.286 --> 00:38:26.806 A:middle
This is a command line tool that

00:38:27.076 --> 00:38:28.976 A:middle
will convert existing 3D models

00:38:29.136 --> 00:38:30.286 A:middle
to usdz format.

00:38:31.486 --> 00:38:34.516 A:middle
It ships inside Xcode 10, and in

00:38:34.516 --> 00:38:36.556 A:middle
addition to creating usdz files,

00:38:37.206 --> 00:38:38.726 A:middle
you could also use it to map PBR

00:38:38.726 --> 00:38:40.646 A:middle
textures to the meshes and

00:38:40.646 --> 00:38:42.176 A:middle
submeshes inside those existing

00:38:42.176 --> 00:38:42.476 A:middle
models.

00:38:43.156 --> 00:38:47.226 A:middle
It's X3 input format, OBJ files,

00:38:47.446 --> 00:38:49.706 A:middle
Alembic files, and existing USD

00:38:49.706 --> 00:38:52.736 A:middle
files, either USDA or USDC, the

00:38:52.736 --> 00:38:54.586 A:middle
ASCII and binary versions of

00:38:55.106 --> 00:38:55.206 A:middle
USD.

00:38:56.496 --> 00:38:58.456 A:middle
Before we create one, let's take

00:38:58.456 --> 00:38:59.396 A:middle
a look at what it is we're going

00:38:59.396 --> 00:38:59.736 A:middle
to make.

00:38:59.876 --> 00:39:01.586 A:middle
Let's look inside a usdz file.


00:38:59.876 --> 00:39:01.586 A:middle
Let's look inside a usdz file.

00:39:03.036 --> 00:39:04.406 A:middle
In essence, these are

00:39:04.406 --> 00:39:06.146 A:middle
uncompressed zip archives.

00:39:06.926 --> 00:39:09.626 A:middle
The first file is always a usdc

00:39:09.756 --> 00:39:10.016 A:middle
file.

00:39:10.786 --> 00:39:12.236 A:middle
This contains the model's mesh,

00:39:12.546 --> 00:39:13.936 A:middle
its animation, if it has some,

00:39:13.936 --> 00:39:15.536 A:middle
and any material definitions it

00:39:15.536 --> 00:39:15.726 A:middle
needs.

00:39:16.976 --> 00:39:17.936 A:middle
And then, the remainder of the

00:39:17.936 --> 00:39:19.916 A:middle
files in the archive are any

00:39:19.996 --> 00:39:21.276 A:middle
textures, any images, like the

00:39:21.276 --> 00:39:22.876 A:middle
ones we saw earlier on.

00:39:24.116 --> 00:39:25.446 A:middle
If you're thinking of creating

00:39:25.446 --> 00:39:27.666 A:middle
your own tooling to build usdz

00:39:27.666 --> 00:39:29.406 A:middle
files, the great news is that

00:39:29.406 --> 00:39:30.246 A:middle
this is that this is an open

00:39:30.246 --> 00:39:32.436 A:middle
format and Pixar have published

00:39:32.486 --> 00:39:33.856 A:middle
the direct specification for

00:39:33.856 --> 00:39:36.536 A:middle
usdz on the graphics.pixar.com

00:39:37.106 --> 00:39:37.206 A:middle
site.

00:39:38.836 --> 00:39:40.446 A:middle
To create one with a usdz

00:39:40.446 --> 00:39:42.486 A:middle
converter, first note that we

00:39:42.486 --> 00:39:44.476 A:middle
call the tool with xcrun because

00:39:44.476 --> 00:39:45.556 A:middle
it shifts inside Xcode.

00:39:46.476 --> 00:39:47.516 A:middle
We pass in the name of the model

00:39:47.516 --> 00:39:49.436 A:middle
we want to convert, an OBJ file

00:39:49.436 --> 00:39:51.206 A:middle
in this case, and the file name

00:39:51.206 --> 00:39:52.866 A:middle
of the usdz we want to have the

00:39:52.866 --> 00:39:53.706 A:middle
other end.

00:39:54.676 --> 00:39:56.766 A:middle
To map PBR textures to the

00:39:56.766 --> 00:39:59.246 A:middle
meshes they're in, we use the -g

00:39:59.246 --> 00:40:00.816 A:middle
option, followed by the name of


00:39:59.246 --> 00:40:00.816 A:middle
option, followed by the name of

00:40:00.816 --> 00:40:02.216 A:middle
one of the groups, a mesh or a

00:40:02.216 --> 00:40:03.506 A:middle
submesh that we want to map them

00:40:03.506 --> 00:40:05.356 A:middle
to, and then we can provide any

00:40:05.356 --> 00:40:06.706 A:middle
number of these textures for

00:40:06.706 --> 00:40:07.456 A:middle
that particular group.

00:40:08.886 --> 00:40:10.326 A:middle
To map multiple textures to

00:40:10.326 --> 00:40:12.036 A:middle
multiple groups, we can use the

00:40:12.036 --> 00:40:13.586 A:middle
-g option multiple times, as

00:40:13.586 --> 00:40:15.126 A:middle
many as we need, to map all the

00:40:15.126 --> 00:40:15.886 A:middle
textures in our model.

00:40:16.426 --> 00:40:18.406 A:middle
And if you're not sure what the

00:40:18.406 --> 00:40:19.646 A:middle
groups in your model are called,

00:40:20.246 --> 00:40:22.026 A:middle
you can pass in the -v option

00:40:22.026 --> 00:40:23.176 A:middle
for verbose output.

00:40:23.486 --> 00:40:24.496 A:middle
This will print the names of the

00:40:24.496 --> 00:40:26.016 A:middle
groups that we find in the model

00:40:26.166 --> 00:40:27.596 A:middle
plus useful other information

00:40:27.596 --> 00:40:28.636 A:middle
about the conversion process.

00:40:31.096 --> 00:40:32.696 A:middle
In addition to making your own

00:40:32.696 --> 00:40:34.536 A:middle
models, we've also put together

00:40:34.536 --> 00:40:36.546 A:middle
a gallery of example models that

00:40:36.546 --> 00:40:37.826 A:middle
show good practices for PBR.

00:40:37.826 --> 00:40:40.546 A:middle
If you visit this gallery in an

00:40:40.546 --> 00:40:42.706 A:middle
iOS 12 device, you can tap any

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:44.306 A:middle
of these models, open them in AR

00:40:44.336 --> 00:40:45.616 A:middle
Quick Look, and place them in

00:40:45.616 --> 00:40:45.936 A:middle
the world.

00:40:46.926 --> 00:40:48.856 A:middle
This gallery also showcases the

00:40:48.976 --> 00:40:50.186 A:middle
Safari integration that David

00:40:50.186 --> 00:40:50.946 A:middle
showed you earlier on.

00:40:51.566 --> 00:40:53.436 A:middle
So, if you have iOS 12 on a

00:40:53.436 --> 00:40:54.706 A:middle
device, visit

00:40:54.706 --> 00:40:57.966 A:middle
develop@apple.com/arkit/gallery

00:40:58.336 --> 00:41:01.816 A:middle
and give them a try.


00:40:58.336 --> 00:41:01.816 A:middle
and give them a try.

00:41:02.036 --> 00:41:05.166 A:middle
So, in summary, AR Quick Look is

00:41:05.166 --> 00:41:07.016 A:middle
a system-wide way to view AR

00:41:07.016 --> 00:41:08.466 A:middle
content in the real world.

00:41:09.756 --> 00:41:10.936 A:middle
It can be integrated into your

00:41:10.936 --> 00:41:12.216 A:middle
own apps and websites.

00:41:12.216 --> 00:41:16.076 A:middle
It uses the usdz file format for

00:41:16.076 --> 00:41:17.466 A:middle
3D model distribution and

00:41:17.466 --> 00:41:17.856 A:middle
sharing.

00:41:19.336 --> 00:41:21.436 A:middle
It supports PBR, animation, and

00:41:21.436 --> 00:41:24.336 A:middle
transparency, and you can use

00:41:24.336 --> 00:41:25.506 A:middle
the usdz converter tool that

00:41:25.506 --> 00:41:27.366 A:middle
ships in Xcode 10 to convert

00:41:27.366 --> 00:41:29.616 A:middle
your existing models to usdz.

00:41:30.456 --> 00:41:31.676 A:middle
For more information on the

00:41:31.676 --> 00:41:33.156 A:middle
subjects in this talk, check out

00:41:33.156 --> 00:41:33.936 A:middle
the session's website.

00:41:35.036 --> 00:41:36.306 A:middle
And we also have ARKit labs

00:41:36.306 --> 00:41:36.886 A:middle
throughout the week.

00:41:37.076 --> 00:41:38.036 A:middle
So, please do bring any

00:41:38.036 --> 00:41:39.256 A:middle
questions you have about AR

00:41:39.256 --> 00:41:40.376 A:middle
Quick Look, and we'd be really

00:41:40.376 --> 00:41:41.526 A:middle
happy to help you answer them.

00:41:42.566 --> 00:41:42.846 A:middle
Thank you.

00:41:43.516 --> 00:41:47.500 A:middle
