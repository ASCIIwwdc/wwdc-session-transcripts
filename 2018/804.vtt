00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:33.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello everyone, I'm Julian,

00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:36.716 A:middle
later we'll be joined by Hugo

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:38.956 A:middle
who designs sounds across our

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:39.516 A:middle
products.

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:42.246 A:middle
Before we begin I wanted to

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:44.126 A:middle
explain a little bit about why

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:45.056 A:middle
we're going to be talking about

00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:46.316 A:middle
a button for a while here.

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:51.136 A:middle
I design and prototype user

00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:52.896 A:middle
interfaces for future hardware.

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:55.526 A:middle
Because of the nature of my work

00:00:55.946 --> 00:00:57.256 A:middle
I can't always use standard

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:57.806 A:middle
UIKit.

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:01.606 A:middle
I have built and rebuilt a lot


00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:01.606 A:middle
I have built and rebuilt a lot

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:03.366 A:middle
of basic user interface elements

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.306 A:middle
like scrolling, zooming, paging,

00:01:06.306 --> 00:01:08.536 A:middle
and of course buttons and I've

00:01:08.536 --> 00:01:11.216 A:middle
learned a lot about the details

00:01:12.026 --> 00:01:13.436 A:middle
involved in designing and

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:14.446 A:middle
building these controls.

00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:18.426 A:middle
So I'm here to share a little

00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:20.446 A:middle
bit about what I've learned with

00:01:20.486 --> 00:01:20.766 A:middle
you.

00:01:21.776 --> 00:01:23.356 A:middle
I want to show you how something

00:01:23.356 --> 00:01:27.126 A:middle
so simple, a button, has a lot

00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:29.206 A:middle
of consideration and complexity

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:30.396 A:middle
behind it.

00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:32.926 A:middle
And I hope that through looking

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.326 A:middle
at this button you can learn a

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:34.826 A:middle
few things.

00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:38.396 A:middle
I want you to use standard

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:39.676 A:middle
controls more thoughtfully.

00:01:41.026 --> 00:01:43.256 A:middle
To consider when to build your

00:01:43.256 --> 00:01:44.286 A:middle
own custom controls.

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:46.846 A:middle
And when you do build custom

00:01:46.846 --> 00:01:49.336 A:middle
controls I want you to consider

00:01:49.336 --> 00:01:50.846 A:middle
your interactions all the way

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:51.216 A:middle
through.

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:53.456 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:58.586 A:middle
Hugo and I are expanding our

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:00.676 A:middle
artisanal toast app empire.


00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:00.676 A:middle
artisanal toast app empire.

00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:05.446 A:middle
We are building a new simpler

00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:08.346 A:middle
app that is connected to a

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:08.846 A:middle
toaster.

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:11.966 A:middle
If you imagine for a moment

00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:13.066 A:middle
you're getting ready in the

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.596 A:middle
morning, you want to make sure

00:02:15.596 --> 00:02:17.266 A:middle
you have breakfast ready by the

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:18.386 A:middle
time you're heading out the

00:02:18.386 --> 00:02:18.706 A:middle
door.

00:02:18.796 --> 00:02:21.886 A:middle
All you have to do is launch our

00:02:21.886 --> 00:02:24.496 A:middle
app, press a button and expect a

00:02:24.496 --> 00:02:26.316 A:middle
fresh piece of toast waiting for

00:02:26.316 --> 00:02:29.486 A:middle
you in your kitchen.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:32.286 A:middle
Now this works with our

00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:33.516 A:middle
connected toaster.

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:35.256 A:middle
Our connected toaster goes

00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:36.956 A:middle
through a few different states,

00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:38.886 A:middle
it's ready and waiting for a new

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:41.346 A:middle
piece of toast, it's making

00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:43.236 A:middle
toast, and finally the toast is

00:02:43.236 --> 00:02:44.176 A:middle
done, the important part.

00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:46.936 A:middle
But the way that our connected

00:02:46.936 --> 00:02:48.226 A:middle
toaster ends up transitioning

00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:51.436 A:middle
between these states is people

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:52.866 A:middle
using our app.

00:02:52.976 --> 00:02:55.496 A:middle
When they use our app they can

00:02:55.496 --> 00:02:57.796 A:middle
request a piece of toast to

00:02:57.796 --> 00:02:58.876 A:middle
start the toaster going.


00:03:00.686 --> 00:03:02.386 A:middle
When the toast is done they will

00:03:02.386 --> 00:03:04.136 A:middle
of course eat it.

00:03:04.296 --> 00:03:05.456 A:middle
Maybe for some reason they'd

00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:06.436 A:middle
want to cancel it, I'm not

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:07.316 A:middle
really sure about this one.

00:03:08.236 --> 00:03:09.806 A:middle
And of course we want to make

00:03:09.806 --> 00:03:11.316 A:middle
sure our toaster is always ready

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:11.976 A:middle
to serve.

00:03:12.146 --> 00:03:13.686 A:middle
I'm not going to disclose

00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:15.296 A:middle
exactly how this works but trust

00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:18.276 A:middle
me it does and it's great.

00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:20.196 A:middle
We also have big plans for the

00:03:20.196 --> 00:03:22.526 A:middle
future, we could have AR toast,

00:03:22.756 --> 00:03:24.366 A:middle
queues of toast, multiple

00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:25.976 A:middle
toasters per household, and

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:27.166 A:middle
eventually we'll connect this

00:03:27.216 --> 00:03:28.456 A:middle
back up to our toast social

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:28.826 A:middle
network.

00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:31.536 A:middle
My point is there's a lot going

00:03:31.536 --> 00:03:36.566 A:middle
on in here and for today's

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:38.576 A:middle
session we're going to dive deep

00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:40.216 A:middle
into the details of a single

00:03:40.216 --> 00:03:42.986 A:middle
screen, in fact a single button

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:47.186 A:middle
on a single screen of our app.

00:03:47.446 --> 00:03:48.786 A:middle
If we get to the details of our

00:03:48.786 --> 00:03:50.746 A:middle
most important interaction right

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.176 A:middle
the rest will flow from it.

00:03:54.356 --> 00:03:55.646 A:middle
So if we look at our system

00:03:55.646 --> 00:03:59.276 A:middle
again I think the most important

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:01.936 A:middle
interaction here is actually


00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:01.936 A:middle
interaction here is actually

00:04:01.936 --> 00:04:04.066 A:middle
when we request toast.

00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:05.386 A:middle
Obviously, all the rest of this

00:04:05.386 --> 00:04:07.496 A:middle
has to work, but requesting

00:04:07.496 --> 00:04:08.936 A:middle
toast is the first impression

00:04:09.136 --> 00:04:10.776 A:middle
and if people aren't able to

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:12.396 A:middle
start the toaster the rest of it

00:04:12.456 --> 00:04:12.976 A:middle
doesn't really matter.

00:04:18.136 --> 00:04:20.466 A:middle
So to do this today we're going

00:04:20.466 --> 00:04:21.666 A:middle
to start by talking a little bit

00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:24.506 A:middle
about what a button is, then I'm

00:04:24.566 --> 00:04:26.096 A:middle
going to share with you a way of

00:04:26.096 --> 00:04:28.456 A:middle
thinking about interactive

00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:29.076 A:middle
controls.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:32.396 A:middle
And finally, Hugo will join us

00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:33.786 A:middle
at add some sound to our Button.

00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:39.406 A:middle
So what is a button anyway?

00:04:39.996 --> 00:04:42.566 A:middle
The buttons that we are talking

00:04:42.566 --> 00:04:45.396 A:middle
about today or onscreen user

00:04:45.396 --> 00:04:46.496 A:middle
interface controls.

00:04:47.906 --> 00:04:50.636 A:middle
Buttons are indirect controllers

00:04:50.636 --> 00:04:51.136 A:middle
of action.

00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:54.796 A:middle
What I mean by this is when you

00:04:54.866 --> 00:04:57.556 A:middle
tap a button the action happens

00:04:57.556 --> 00:04:58.456 A:middle
somewhere else.

00:04:59.456 --> 00:05:01.766 A:middle
This is as opposed to a direct


00:04:59.456 --> 00:05:01.766 A:middle
This is as opposed to a direct

00:05:01.936 --> 00:05:04.936 A:middle
interaction where here I'm

00:05:04.936 --> 00:05:06.036 A:middle
grabbing the lever and

00:05:06.036 --> 00:05:07.576 A:middle
controlling the lever directly.

00:05:08.796 --> 00:05:11.316 A:middle
Direct interactions can

00:05:11.316 --> 00:05:12.586 A:middle
reference the real-world

00:05:12.586 --> 00:05:14.806 A:middle
experience and feel more fun.

00:05:15.316 --> 00:05:18.046 A:middle
But the real power of indirect

00:05:18.046 --> 00:05:19.766 A:middle
interactions like buttons is

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:20.996 A:middle
that they can be clearer and

00:05:20.996 --> 00:05:22.886 A:middle
more powerful because of their

00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:23.656 A:middle
separation.

00:05:25.336 --> 00:05:26.866 A:middle
The interesting thing here being

00:05:26.866 --> 00:05:28.726 A:middle
that even the physical buttons

00:05:28.826 --> 00:05:30.036 A:middle
that these onscreen buttons are

00:05:30.036 --> 00:05:31.946 A:middle
imitating are indirect.

00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:38.916 A:middle
Even though the action, the

00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:40.916 A:middle
result is happening somewhere

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:43.416 A:middle
else the button controls that

00:05:43.416 --> 00:05:43.876 A:middle
action.

00:05:44.296 --> 00:05:45.886 A:middle
And just like the action a

00:05:45.886 --> 00:05:48.356 A:middle
result can be designed a button

00:05:48.356 --> 00:05:50.066 A:middle
can be designed, we can consider

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:51.726 A:middle
both of these things separately

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:52.646 A:middle
and connected.

00:05:54.956 --> 00:05:57.116 A:middle
To do this today we're going to

00:05:57.116 --> 00:05:59.556 A:middle
be relying heavily on a single

00:05:59.556 --> 00:06:02.796 A:middle
lens of design feedback.


00:05:59.556 --> 00:06:02.796 A:middle
lens of design feedback.

00:06:04.416 --> 00:06:06.766 A:middle
Feedback is how you let people

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:08.976 A:middle
know what your app is doing.

00:06:10.376 --> 00:06:12.256 A:middle
I'm sure a lot of you have

00:06:12.256 --> 00:06:13.336 A:middle
thought of a variety of

00:06:13.336 --> 00:06:15.326 A:middle
different ways that you can

00:06:15.326 --> 00:06:16.436 A:middle
provide feedback within your

00:06:16.436 --> 00:06:18.126 A:middle
apps and are already doing so.

00:06:18.926 --> 00:06:22.226 A:middle
But I think there are two major

00:06:22.226 --> 00:06:23.666 A:middle
categories of feedback.

00:06:25.036 --> 00:06:27.366 A:middle
The first is that you can tell

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:29.766 A:middle
people, you can literally put

00:06:29.816 --> 00:06:31.676 A:middle
text on screen explaining what's

00:06:31.676 --> 00:06:34.206 A:middle
going on or design icons that

00:06:34.206 --> 00:06:34.916 A:middle
explain things.

00:06:36.756 --> 00:06:38.946 A:middle
The second is that you can show

00:06:38.946 --> 00:06:41.326 A:middle
people, you can allow people to

00:06:41.326 --> 00:06:43.736 A:middle
experience the results of their

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:46.056 A:middle
action more like the real world

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:49.766 A:middle
through visual, audio or even

00:06:49.766 --> 00:06:51.866 A:middle
haptic change over time.

00:06:56.046 --> 00:06:56.836 A:middle
Now we're going to apply

00:06:56.836 --> 00:07:00.726 A:middle
feedback to three phases of an


00:06:56.836 --> 00:07:00.726 A:middle
feedback to three phases of an

00:07:00.726 --> 00:07:04.216 A:middle
interaction, not just its

00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:04.766 A:middle
completion.

00:07:05.706 --> 00:07:07.196 A:middle
We can think of these phases in

00:07:07.196 --> 00:07:08.706 A:middle
terms of a physical button.

00:07:11.096 --> 00:07:12.986 A:middle
Before I have pressed the button

00:07:14.106 --> 00:07:17.616 A:middle
it's just hanging out there.

00:07:17.796 --> 00:07:19.446 A:middle
During my interaction with that

00:07:19.446 --> 00:07:21.346 A:middle
button it's being pressed in.

00:07:21.896 --> 00:07:26.166 A:middle
And finally after I've pressed

00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:27.836 A:middle
that button my finger is lifting

00:07:27.836 --> 00:07:28.986 A:middle
off of it and it's returning to

00:07:28.986 --> 00:07:29.836 A:middle
its original state.

00:07:29.836 --> 00:07:36.036 A:middle
So what does it even mean to be

00:07:36.036 --> 00:07:39.086 A:middle
providing feedback before I have

00:07:39.146 --> 00:07:41.086 A:middle
begun interacting with a button,

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:42.406 A:middle
why does this even matter, the

00:07:42.546 --> 00:07:43.586 A:middle
button's just there right.

00:07:45.046 --> 00:07:46.636 A:middle
Well if we think about our

00:07:46.636 --> 00:07:49.466 A:middle
iPhones for a moment, the iPhone

00:07:49.466 --> 00:07:52.076 A:middle
screen is just a piece of glass.

00:07:53.286 --> 00:07:54.446 A:middle
This piece of glass happens to

00:07:54.446 --> 00:07:56.056 A:middle
have glowing pixels underneath

00:07:56.056 --> 00:07:58.626 A:middle
it and what matters is what

00:07:58.626 --> 00:08:00.356 A:middle
people think those pixels mean.


00:07:58.626 --> 00:08:00.356 A:middle
people think those pixels mean.

00:08:01.806 --> 00:08:04.166 A:middle
Glass doesn't tell you that it's

00:08:04.166 --> 00:08:06.856 A:middle
tappable, but something on

00:08:06.856 --> 00:08:07.396 A:middle
screen might.

00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:10.076 A:middle
You could see that you could

00:08:10.076 --> 00:08:13.456 A:middle
page through something, drag

00:08:13.456 --> 00:08:16.346 A:middle
something or of course for the

00:08:16.346 --> 00:08:17.546 A:middle
purposes of this presentation

00:08:17.546 --> 00:08:18.476 A:middle
tap on something.

00:08:19.016 --> 00:08:23.686 A:middle
The academic term for what I'm

00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:25.416 A:middle
talking about is perceived

00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:26.196 A:middle
affordance.

00:08:27.176 --> 00:08:28.766 A:middle
Affordance refers to the

00:08:28.766 --> 00:08:31.716 A:middle
connection between an object and

00:08:31.746 --> 00:08:33.336 A:middle
the person interacting with it.

00:08:33.775 --> 00:08:35.395 A:middle
A person might know that they

00:08:35.395 --> 00:08:37.496 A:middle
can grab a handle or press in on

00:08:37.496 --> 00:08:38.296 A:middle
a physical button.

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:40.525 A:middle
But the perceived part of this

00:08:40.926 --> 00:08:42.876 A:middle
is talking about what people

00:08:42.876 --> 00:08:45.106 A:middle
know about those glowing pixels

00:08:45.106 --> 00:08:45.766 A:middle
on screen.

00:08:46.396 --> 00:08:47.556 A:middle
People only know what they can

00:08:47.556 --> 00:08:49.036 A:middle
interact with on that iPhone

00:08:49.036 --> 00:08:50.986 A:middle
screen because of their prior

00:08:50.986 --> 00:08:53.036 A:middle
experience having used iOS

00:08:53.036 --> 00:08:55.376 A:middle
before and their current

00:08:55.376 --> 00:08:56.886 A:middle
context, the fact that they're

00:08:56.886 --> 00:08:59.276 A:middle
on this phone in an app that

00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:00.926 A:middle
they may or may not understand.


00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:00.926 A:middle
they may or may not understand.

00:09:02.746 --> 00:09:05.956 A:middle
So let's apply this to our toast

00:09:05.956 --> 00:09:07.466 A:middle
app of course.

00:09:08.636 --> 00:09:10.526 A:middle
How do I know what will happen

00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:12.046 A:middle
when I tap this button, I just

00:09:12.046 --> 00:09:13.616 A:middle
put a button up and call it okay

00:09:13.616 --> 00:09:14.526 A:middle
right, no.

00:09:14.696 --> 00:09:18.926 A:middle
What we do is provide a label, a

00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:21.486 A:middle
label is feedback in which you

00:09:21.486 --> 00:09:23.376 A:middle
are telling people literally

00:09:23.456 --> 00:09:24.436 A:middle
what is going to happen.

00:09:24.996 --> 00:09:27.896 A:middle
In this particular case I tried

00:09:27.896 --> 00:09:29.406 A:middle
the label toast, but

00:09:29.406 --> 00:09:31.176 A:middle
unfortunately toast refers to

00:09:31.176 --> 00:09:32.946 A:middle
both the verb to toast and it

00:09:32.946 --> 00:09:34.736 A:middle
also refers to the delicious

00:09:34.736 --> 00:09:35.436 A:middle
piece of bread you're going to

00:09:35.436 --> 00:09:36.406 A:middle
be eating for breakfast.

00:09:37.136 --> 00:09:38.666 A:middle
So what should we call this

00:09:38.666 --> 00:09:40.016 A:middle
label, toast toast?

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:43.576 A:middle
No. We could try to design an

00:09:43.636 --> 00:09:47.196 A:middle
icon for this button but I think

00:09:47.196 --> 00:09:48.506 A:middle
this isn't particularly clear,

00:09:48.506 --> 00:09:49.566 A:middle
especially for something that

00:09:49.786 --> 00:09:50.876 A:middle
people will be encountering for

00:09:50.876 --> 00:09:52.586 A:middle
the first time in an unfamiliar

00:09:52.586 --> 00:09:53.116 A:middle
context.

00:09:53.866 --> 00:09:55.176 A:middle
So we thought about it a little

00:09:55.406 --> 00:09:56.366 A:middle
bit and we came up with the

00:09:56.366 --> 00:09:57.766 A:middle
phrase make toast.

00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:00.056 A:middle
I know that in our diagram we


00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:00.056 A:middle
I know that in our diagram we

00:10:00.056 --> 00:10:01.576 A:middle
refer to this as request toast

00:10:01.656 --> 00:10:03.066 A:middle
but we spent some time thinking

00:10:03.066 --> 00:10:06.316 A:middle
about what people using our app

00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:08.896 A:middle
might understand and what feels

00:10:08.896 --> 00:10:09.976 A:middle
most comfortable for our app.

00:10:14.206 --> 00:10:15.256 A:middle
The next thing to think about is

00:10:15.256 --> 00:10:16.576 A:middle
how do I even know that this is

00:10:16.576 --> 00:10:18.566 A:middle
a button, just a rectangle

00:10:18.566 --> 00:10:20.726 A:middle
floating on a black background

00:10:20.726 --> 00:10:21.646 A:middle
might not be enough.

00:10:22.806 --> 00:10:24.606 A:middle
But if you add some context like

00:10:24.606 --> 00:10:27.216 A:middle
an iPhone screen you might start

00:10:27.216 --> 00:10:28.646 A:middle
to understand it or you could

00:10:28.646 --> 00:10:30.346 A:middle
add some prior experience.

00:10:30.876 --> 00:10:32.056 A:middle
It could be the shape of the

00:10:32.056 --> 00:10:34.966 A:middle
button, the manner in which is

00:10:34.966 --> 00:10:38.136 A:middle
rendered or if it's used

00:10:38.136 --> 00:10:39.726 A:middle
consistently enough just the

00:10:39.726 --> 00:10:43.006 A:middle
color of text.

00:10:43.146 --> 00:10:45.696 A:middle
In this case, I don't think

00:10:45.696 --> 00:10:46.706 A:middle
people are going to be very

00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:47.736 A:middle
familiar with our app they're

00:10:47.736 --> 00:10:48.826 A:middle
going to be launching it once a

00:10:48.826 --> 00:10:51.746 A:middle
day, more if we're lucky so

00:10:51.746 --> 00:10:52.886 A:middle
we're going to focus on more

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:54.776 A:middle
standard iOS button shapes

00:10:54.876 --> 00:10:56.036 A:middle
because we don't want to throw

00:10:56.036 --> 00:10:56.656 A:middle
in something new.

00:10:57.656 --> 00:10:59.546 A:middle
So we try these out on screen.


00:11:04.126 --> 00:11:05.426 A:middle
Another thing that we can think

00:11:05.426 --> 00:11:07.356 A:middle
about with respect to feedback

00:11:07.396 --> 00:11:08.916 A:middle
before we begin using this

00:11:08.916 --> 00:11:10.636 A:middle
button is how do I even know

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:12.206 A:middle
what this button relates to.

00:11:12.866 --> 00:11:13.856 A:middle
It could be something about

00:11:13.856 --> 00:11:15.916 A:middle
where in the app a button is

00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:17.686 A:middle
located, these buttons have

00:11:17.686 --> 00:11:18.726 A:middle
different meaning and feel.

00:11:18.726 --> 00:11:21.696 A:middle
Or it could be something about

00:11:21.696 --> 00:11:23.166 A:middle
how it's grouped with other

00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:26.666 A:middle
controls or how close it is to

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:27.866 A:middle
other objects on screen.

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:31.426 A:middle
I'm starting to like this last

00:11:31.426 --> 00:11:33.536 A:middle
one here so we're going to try

00:11:33.536 --> 00:11:35.086 A:middle
it out on a real screen.

00:11:35.776 --> 00:11:37.096 A:middle
I drew this user interface in

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:39.106 A:middle
Keynote and I put it on a phone

00:11:39.476 --> 00:11:40.826 A:middle
and I'm holding this phone in my

00:11:40.826 --> 00:11:42.236 A:middle
bedroom where I might expect to

00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:44.056 A:middle
use it in the morning before I

00:11:44.056 --> 00:11:44.616 A:middle
order toast.

00:11:44.616 --> 00:11:45.306 A:middle
And I'm just trying to

00:11:45.306 --> 00:11:48.056 A:middle
understand do I know what this

00:11:48.056 --> 00:11:48.836 A:middle
button will do.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:53.836 A:middle
The next thing we should think

00:11:53.836 --> 00:11:57.096 A:middle
about is what happens during my

00:11:57.096 --> 00:11:58.316 A:middle
interaction with this button.

00:11:58.836 --> 00:12:01.466 A:middle
For a physical button I'd be


00:11:58.836 --> 00:12:01.466 A:middle
For a physical button I'd be

00:12:01.466 --> 00:12:01.976 A:middle
pressing it in.

00:12:08.046 --> 00:12:12.056 A:middle
Now the term feedback refers to

00:12:12.646 --> 00:12:14.186 A:middle
telling people something about

00:12:14.186 --> 00:12:15.746 A:middle
the result of what has happened

00:12:16.746 --> 00:12:18.096 A:middle
and in this case, we haven't

00:12:18.526 --> 00:12:20.666 A:middle
actually done anything yet, so

00:12:20.666 --> 00:12:21.946 A:middle
we might use the term

00:12:22.026 --> 00:12:23.286 A:middle
feedforward for this.

00:12:24.906 --> 00:12:27.866 A:middle
Because feedforward refers to

00:12:28.426 --> 00:12:30.596 A:middle
helping people understand what

00:12:30.736 --> 00:12:32.886 A:middle
is happening while they're

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:34.186 A:middle
interacting with this button.

00:12:35.856 --> 00:12:38.306 A:middle
Feedforward is a component of

00:12:38.306 --> 00:12:39.956 A:middle
making interactions feel fluid,

00:12:40.476 --> 00:12:42.976 A:middle
you can convey responsiveness

00:12:42.976 --> 00:12:45.756 A:middle
for things like 3-D touch, pinch

00:12:45.756 --> 00:12:46.886 A:middle
or slide movements.

00:12:49.616 --> 00:12:51.146 A:middle
Thinking about how feedforward

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.776 A:middle
applies to our button we should

00:12:53.776 --> 00:12:55.126 A:middle
be thinking about what is

00:12:55.126 --> 00:12:56.966 A:middle
happening now, what is happening

00:12:57.186 --> 00:12:58.306 A:middle
while my finger is making

00:12:58.306 --> 00:13:00.256 A:middle
contact with the screen, with


00:12:58.306 --> 00:13:00.256 A:middle
contact with the screen, with

00:13:00.256 --> 00:13:00.786 A:middle
that button.

00:13:01.316 --> 00:13:04.176 A:middle
In the case of our overall toast

00:13:04.176 --> 00:13:07.246 A:middle
system we are in the middle of

00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:08.726 A:middle
touching a button to request

00:13:08.726 --> 00:13:09.026 A:middle
toast.

00:13:09.736 --> 00:13:10.916 A:middle
So the part we're going to focus

00:13:10.916 --> 00:13:13.706 A:middle
on is the toaster being ready

00:13:13.816 --> 00:13:15.956 A:middle
and eventually transitioning to

00:13:15.956 --> 00:13:17.296 A:middle
the toaster making toast.

00:13:17.816 --> 00:13:20.716 A:middle
We should be thinking about what

00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:22.346 A:middle
is happening and how I can hint

00:13:22.346 --> 00:13:23.826 A:middle
toward what will happen.

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.186 A:middle
Let's say I've begun touching

00:13:30.666 --> 00:13:32.826 A:middle
this button, how do I know that

00:13:32.826 --> 00:13:33.906 A:middle
I've begun tapping this button,

00:13:34.326 --> 00:13:35.356 A:middle
why does it even matter?

00:13:36.426 --> 00:13:38.896 A:middle
Well, for one, the hit area of

00:13:38.896 --> 00:13:39.866 A:middle
this button might not be what

00:13:39.866 --> 00:13:41.476 A:middle
you expect, if you look closely

00:13:41.476 --> 00:13:43.456 A:middle
at the circle maybe I'm not

00:13:43.456 --> 00:13:45.036 A:middle
quite touching it.

00:13:45.576 --> 00:13:46.796 A:middle
But perhaps the hit area is

00:13:46.796 --> 00:13:47.846 A:middle
actually a little bit larger

00:13:47.846 --> 00:13:49.866 A:middle
than the visual size, this is

00:13:50.146 --> 00:13:51.386 A:middle
particularly important for very

00:13:51.386 --> 00:13:52.756 A:middle
small controls if we made that

00:13:52.756 --> 00:13:53.676 A:middle
lever interactive.

00:13:57.006 --> 00:13:58.196 A:middle
So how do I know I've begun

00:13:58.196 --> 00:13:58.966 A:middle
tapping this button?

00:13:59.546 --> 00:14:02.376 A:middle
Well you might be tempted to


00:13:59.546 --> 00:14:02.376 A:middle
Well you might be tempted to

00:14:02.376 --> 00:14:04.126 A:middle
animate the button, to have it

00:14:04.126 --> 00:14:07.096 A:middle
fade in or grow very slowly, but

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:07.996 A:middle
this can make things feel

00:14:07.996 --> 00:14:08.826 A:middle
unresponsive.

00:14:10.066 --> 00:14:12.086 A:middle
This kind of animation might be

00:14:12.086 --> 00:14:13.506 A:middle
appropriate for 3-D touch if

00:14:13.506 --> 00:14:15.316 A:middle
it's responding continuously as

00:14:15.316 --> 00:14:16.026 A:middle
I'm pressing in.

00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:19.166 A:middle
But for a quick contact with the

00:14:19.166 --> 00:14:20.766 A:middle
screen we might want to do

00:14:20.766 --> 00:14:21.936 A:middle
something faster, if we are

00:14:21.936 --> 00:14:22.846 A:middle
going to animate it do it very

00:14:22.846 --> 00:14:23.206 A:middle
quickly.

00:14:23.716 --> 00:14:27.096 A:middle
So what we do is provide a

00:14:27.096 --> 00:14:30.056 A:middle
confirmation sound, a haptic or

00:14:30.056 --> 00:14:31.076 A:middle
visual change.

00:14:31.606 --> 00:14:32.696 A:middle
In this case, we're just going

00:14:32.696 --> 00:14:34.596 A:middle
to highlight it instantaneously,

00:14:35.586 --> 00:14:36.546 A:middle
make it feel a little bit

00:14:36.546 --> 00:14:36.796 A:middle
faster.

00:14:37.806 --> 00:14:38.836 A:middle
This also helps us know that a

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.696 A:middle
button is enabled and that it

00:14:40.696 --> 00:14:41.306 A:middle
can work.

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:47.326 A:middle
Maybe we try connecting the

00:14:47.466 --> 00:14:49.556 A:middle
feedforward on the button to the

00:14:49.646 --> 00:14:51.096 A:middle
feedforward of the toaster

00:14:51.096 --> 00:14:52.256 A:middle
itself, as I said we can start

00:14:52.256 --> 00:14:53.566 A:middle
to hint toward what will happen.

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:55.926 A:middle
So here what I'm trying is as I

00:14:55.926 --> 00:14:57.826 A:middle
touch this button maybe we show

00:14:57.826 --> 00:14:59.066 A:middle
the piece of toast starting to

00:14:59.066 --> 00:14:59.326 A:middle
appear.

00:14:59.576 --> 00:15:01.206 A:middle
I feel like that might be a


00:14:59.576 --> 00:15:01.206 A:middle
I feel like that might be a

00:15:01.206 --> 00:15:02.606 A:middle
little bit too much for this

00:15:02.606 --> 00:15:03.676 A:middle
button though, so I'm not going

00:15:03.676 --> 00:15:04.766 A:middle
to go forward with that but I

00:15:05.396 --> 00:15:07.326 A:middle
tried it.

00:15:07.586 --> 00:15:08.356 A:middle
Another thing that we should

00:15:08.356 --> 00:15:10.846 A:middle
think about with feedforward is

00:15:10.846 --> 00:15:12.016 A:middle
what happens if I change my

00:15:12.016 --> 00:15:14.136 A:middle
mind, let's say I'm kind of

00:15:14.136 --> 00:15:15.496 A:middle
groggy in the morning, I pick up

00:15:15.496 --> 00:15:17.136 A:middle
my phone I accidentally touch

00:15:17.136 --> 00:15:18.906 A:middle
this button but I don't want to

00:15:18.906 --> 00:15:19.826 A:middle
start my toaster yet.

00:15:20.846 --> 00:15:22.946 A:middle
Well for most buttons I can

00:15:22.946 --> 00:15:25.056 A:middle
actually drag my finger outside

00:15:25.056 --> 00:15:26.946 A:middle
of the button to begin canceling

00:15:27.556 --> 00:15:27.626 A:middle
it.

00:15:28.856 --> 00:15:29.876 A:middle
This is something that's

00:15:29.876 --> 00:15:31.476 A:middle
actually very important for all

00:15:31.476 --> 00:15:33.026 A:middle
sorts of fluid interactions

00:15:33.276 --> 00:15:35.226 A:middle
because it's what makes a fluid

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:37.196 A:middle
interaction undecided.

00:15:37.816 --> 00:15:39.346 A:middle
If you're paging through

00:15:39.586 --> 00:15:41.606 A:middle
different screens you don't know

00:15:41.606 --> 00:15:42.606 A:middle
which screen it's going to end

00:15:42.606 --> 00:15:44.166 A:middle
up on until you lift your finger

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:46.126 A:middle
and the same thing applies to a

00:15:46.126 --> 00:15:46.956 A:middle
very simple button.

00:15:46.956 --> 00:15:49.116 A:middle
I can bring my finger back

00:15:49.176 --> 00:15:51.386 A:middle
inside the button and have the

00:15:51.386 --> 00:15:52.856 A:middle
same feedforward show me that I

00:15:52.856 --> 00:15:54.116 A:middle
am now activating this button

00:15:54.116 --> 00:15:54.386 A:middle
again.

00:15:54.866 --> 00:15:59.376 A:middle
Now that we've decided a little

00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:00.766 A:middle
bit about the feedforward that


00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:00.766 A:middle
bit about the feedforward that

00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:01.946 A:middle
we're going to have we should

00:16:01.946 --> 00:16:03.486 A:middle
try this out on a device as

00:16:03.486 --> 00:16:03.806 A:middle
well.

00:16:04.426 --> 00:16:05.946 A:middle
So again, I know this seems

00:16:05.946 --> 00:16:07.566 A:middle
really simple for a button, but

00:16:07.916 --> 00:16:09.866 A:middle
this is very important for

00:16:09.866 --> 00:16:14.036 A:middle
scroll, pinch, paging, a lot of

00:16:14.036 --> 00:16:14.976 A:middle
touch interactions.

00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:20.846 A:middle
Finally, we should think about

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:23.476 A:middle
how to apply feedback after I

00:16:23.476 --> 00:16:24.826 A:middle
have lifted my finger up off of

00:16:24.826 --> 00:16:25.336 A:middle
this button.

00:16:25.926 --> 00:16:27.386 A:middle
For a physical button it's going

00:16:27.386 --> 00:16:28.966 A:middle
to return to its original state.

00:16:29.336 --> 00:16:32.266 A:middle
For our onscreen button we're

00:16:32.266 --> 00:16:33.866 A:middle
going to have lifted our finger

00:16:34.216 --> 00:16:34.946 A:middle
off the screen.

00:16:36.596 --> 00:16:38.496 A:middle
This is of course the realm of

00:16:39.276 --> 00:16:41.726 A:middle
classic feedback that most of

00:16:41.726 --> 00:16:42.466 A:middle
you are familiar with.

00:16:43.106 --> 00:16:44.466 A:middle
But the thing I want to point

00:16:44.466 --> 00:16:45.806 A:middle
out here is that we can be

00:16:45.806 --> 00:16:47.896 A:middle
thinking about feedback both for

00:16:47.896 --> 00:16:50.456 A:middle
the button itself and the

00:16:50.456 --> 00:16:52.526 A:middle
action, the result that is

00:16:52.526 --> 00:16:54.296 A:middle
happening, and we can think

00:16:54.296 --> 00:16:55.856 A:middle
about how to connect the two so

00:16:55.856 --> 00:16:57.696 A:middle
people understand what has

00:16:57.696 --> 00:16:58.116 A:middle
happened.


00:17:00.496 --> 00:17:02.836 A:middle
Again, within our system we're

00:17:02.836 --> 00:17:05.185 A:middle
only focusing here on getting

00:17:05.185 --> 00:17:07.266 A:middle
people into making toast.

00:17:09.415 --> 00:17:11.396 A:middle
So what happens when I lift my

00:17:11.396 --> 00:17:13.665 A:middle
finger from this button?

00:17:13.796 --> 00:17:15.215 A:middle
Does the unhighlight happen

00:17:15.215 --> 00:17:18.026 A:middle
immediately or is there a slight

00:17:18.026 --> 00:17:21.086 A:middle
delay so that even fast taps can

00:17:21.086 --> 00:17:21.556 A:middle
be seen?

00:17:22.356 --> 00:17:23.715 A:middle
Is there a timer, does this

00:17:23.715 --> 00:17:26.175 A:middle
button support double tap, if so

00:17:26.175 --> 00:17:27.435 A:middle
I may have to wait a little bit

00:17:27.435 --> 00:17:29.306 A:middle
before showing the confirmation?

00:17:29.306 --> 00:17:33.696 A:middle
If we think back to the two

00:17:33.696 --> 00:17:37.156 A:middle
types of feedback we can just

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:39.376 A:middle
literally tell people what is

00:17:39.376 --> 00:17:39.826 A:middle
happening.

00:17:40.606 --> 00:17:42.496 A:middle
I can put some text on screen, I

00:17:42.496 --> 00:17:44.296 A:middle
think it's very clear but it

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:46.266 A:middle
also requires reading and more

00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:46.706 A:middle
text.

00:17:48.196 --> 00:17:50.536 A:middle
So maybe we can show people,

00:17:51.086 --> 00:17:53.686 A:middle
maybe the button itself provides

00:17:53.686 --> 00:17:55.216 A:middle
some feedback here it's flashing

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.786 A:middle
or maybe it's something that

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:00.426 A:middle
represents the action that


00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:00.426 A:middle
represents the action that

00:18:00.426 --> 00:18:01.436 A:middle
provides feedback.

00:18:01.906 --> 00:18:04.946 A:middle
For example, the icon of the

00:18:04.946 --> 00:18:06.766 A:middle
toaster itself could show you

00:18:06.846 --> 00:18:10.776 A:middle
that it's starting to toast.

00:18:10.776 --> 00:18:12.166 A:middle
Or what we can do is we can just

00:18:12.166 --> 00:18:14.476 A:middle
do both, I can put text on

00:18:14.476 --> 00:18:16.386 A:middle
screen and I can show the

00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:16.866 A:middle
toaster.

00:18:17.356 --> 00:18:18.506 A:middle
This is great because I might

00:18:18.506 --> 00:18:19.896 A:middle
have missed that animation, but

00:18:19.896 --> 00:18:21.446 A:middle
I can still see what state the

00:18:21.446 --> 00:18:22.676 A:middle
toaster is in.

00:18:24.056 --> 00:18:27.966 A:middle
But similar to interacting with

00:18:28.046 --> 00:18:30.896 A:middle
the button with feedforward I

00:18:30.896 --> 00:18:32.106 A:middle
should think about what happens

00:18:32.456 --> 00:18:33.726 A:middle
if I change my mind.

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:37.286 A:middle
I've started toasting but maybe

00:18:37.286 --> 00:18:38.506 A:middle
I want to cancel, maybe I want

00:18:38.506 --> 00:18:39.406 A:middle
to stop the toaster.

00:18:39.876 --> 00:18:41.606 A:middle
We could replace that button

00:18:41.606 --> 00:18:43.636 A:middle
with a stop toasting button, but

00:18:43.946 --> 00:18:45.116 A:middle
I think that's not particularly

00:18:45.116 --> 00:18:46.396 A:middle
clear because this button looks

00:18:46.396 --> 00:18:50.076 A:middle
an awful lot like the make toast

00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:51.306 A:middle
button that was up there before.

00:18:52.696 --> 00:18:54.786 A:middle
So maybe there's a separate stop

00:18:54.786 --> 00:18:55.136 A:middle
button.

00:18:56.276 --> 00:18:58.546 A:middle
I feel like that red is a little

00:18:58.546 --> 00:19:01.826 A:middle
bit too much, so maybe we try


00:18:58.546 --> 00:19:01.826 A:middle
bit too much, so maybe we try

00:19:01.826 --> 00:19:05.426 A:middle
that same button but separate

00:19:05.426 --> 00:19:06.446 A:middle
from our make toast button.

00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:08.466 A:middle
This is starting to feel a bit

00:19:08.466 --> 00:19:11.546 A:middle
better, so what I should do is

00:19:11.766 --> 00:19:12.826 A:middle
try it on device again.

00:19:13.356 --> 00:19:17.686 A:middle
We should see how the feedback

00:19:18.046 --> 00:19:20.206 A:middle
on the button itself connects to

00:19:20.206 --> 00:19:22.196 A:middle
the feedback from the toaster

00:19:22.916 --> 00:19:24.886 A:middle
communicating what has happened.

00:19:27.996 --> 00:19:29.836 A:middle
To recap a little bit of what I

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:30.316 A:middle
went over.

00:19:32.456 --> 00:19:34.976 A:middle
Feedback is how you let people

00:19:34.976 --> 00:19:36.766 A:middle
know what it is that your app is

00:19:36.806 --> 00:19:37.106 A:middle
doing.

00:19:38.266 --> 00:19:40.206 A:middle
You can literally tell people,

00:19:41.216 --> 00:19:42.526 A:middle
you can put text on screen it's

00:19:42.526 --> 00:19:45.946 A:middle
fine or you can show people, you

00:19:45.946 --> 00:19:48.066 A:middle
can allow them to experience the

00:19:48.066 --> 00:19:49.006 A:middle
change over time.

00:19:49.556 --> 00:19:53.416 A:middle
We can apply feedback to all

00:19:53.416 --> 00:19:55.486 A:middle
three phases of an interaction,

00:19:56.916 --> 00:19:57.836 A:middle
even a simple button.

00:19:58.376 --> 00:20:01.276 A:middle
And something I was implicitly


00:19:58.376 --> 00:20:01.276 A:middle
And something I was implicitly

00:20:01.276 --> 00:20:04.326 A:middle
doing here is trying out options

00:20:04.426 --> 00:20:05.956 A:middle
to understand what's too little

00:20:06.226 --> 00:20:07.076 A:middle
and too much.

00:20:07.756 --> 00:20:08.916 A:middle
The only way I can really know

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.256 A:middle
if an animation is appropriate

00:20:10.256 --> 00:20:10.946 A:middle
or not is to try it.

00:20:16.066 --> 00:20:17.216 A:middle
So what we've done here is we've

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:19.346 A:middle
designed a very important part

00:20:19.736 --> 00:20:23.126 A:middle
of a much larger system, but I

00:20:23.126 --> 00:20:24.856 A:middle
think it'll be a lot easier to

00:20:25.816 --> 00:20:27.346 A:middle
figure out the flow of the rest

00:20:27.346 --> 00:20:28.566 A:middle
of this once we get this one

00:20:28.566 --> 00:20:29.096 A:middle
piece right.

00:20:29.556 --> 00:20:34.106 A:middle
Now that our button is designed

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:36.686 A:middle
and pretty great I think we can

00:20:36.686 --> 00:20:38.366 A:middle
start to think about sound, so

00:20:38.366 --> 00:20:39.576 A:middle
I'd like to invite Hugo up to

00:20:39.576 --> 00:20:39.906 A:middle
the stage.

00:20:40.516 --> 00:20:46.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:47.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Julian.

00:20:48.436 --> 00:20:48.976 A:middle
Hello everyone.

00:20:53.046 --> 00:20:56.976 A:middle
Now we can make this quick and

00:20:57.526 --> 00:20:59.646 A:middle
add a simple click sound to this

00:20:59.646 --> 00:21:00.046 A:middle
button.


00:20:59.646 --> 00:21:00.046 A:middle
button.

00:21:00.666 --> 00:21:04.576 A:middle
Sounds pretty good or could it

00:21:04.576 --> 00:21:05.656 A:middle
be better?

00:21:06.416 --> 00:21:07.866 A:middle
Could Julian have done a better

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:09.196 A:middle
job and invited me a little

00:21:09.196 --> 00:21:10.976 A:middle
earlier on in the process?

00:21:15.046 --> 00:21:15.586 A:middle
I'd like to tell you a few

00:21:15.586 --> 00:21:16.906 A:middle
things about how as I a sound

00:21:16.906 --> 00:21:18.316 A:middle
designer could approach a

00:21:18.316 --> 00:21:19.256 A:middle
project like this.

00:21:19.736 --> 00:21:23.066 A:middle
I'll talk about where to look

00:21:23.066 --> 00:21:25.696 A:middle
for inspiration, about designing

00:21:25.696 --> 00:21:28.456 A:middle
the sound, and some key building

00:21:28.456 --> 00:21:30.186 A:middle
blocks that we use while doing

00:21:30.186 --> 00:21:30.466 A:middle
this.

00:21:32.376 --> 00:21:34.576 A:middle
But before we dive in why do we

00:21:34.576 --> 00:21:35.466 A:middle
talk about sound?

00:21:35.986 --> 00:21:39.536 A:middle
Now some of you may think our

00:21:39.536 --> 00:21:41.716 A:middle
users mute the sound on their

00:21:41.716 --> 00:21:44.296 A:middle
phone quite often, is it

00:21:44.676 --> 00:21:46.936 A:middle
important to add sound to my

00:21:47.226 --> 00:21:47.786 A:middle
app?

00:21:48.636 --> 00:21:50.056 A:middle
Well of course it's up to you

00:21:50.056 --> 00:21:52.296 A:middle
but George Lucas has said that

00:21:52.296 --> 00:21:54.846 A:middle
50% of the experience of a movie

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:56.656 A:middle
is determined by what we hear,

00:21:57.276 --> 00:21:59.406 A:middle
by its music and sound design.


00:22:00.516 --> 00:22:02.736 A:middle
And sound is all around us, we

00:22:02.736 --> 00:22:05.046 A:middle
use it to navigate through the

00:22:05.046 --> 00:22:05.456 A:middle
world.

00:22:07.156 --> 00:22:10.636 A:middle
And sound can help enrich the

00:22:10.636 --> 00:22:12.506 A:middle
experience of your products.

00:22:13.056 --> 00:22:16.506 A:middle
And it helps us remember the

00:22:16.506 --> 00:22:19.026 A:middle
experiences of your app, as well

00:22:19.026 --> 00:22:22.976 A:middle
as your brand, so it can have a

00:22:22.976 --> 00:22:24.226 A:middle
big impact.

00:22:25.516 --> 00:22:26.676 A:middle
So where do we look for

00:22:26.676 --> 00:22:27.876 A:middle
inspiration when we want to

00:22:27.876 --> 00:22:29.656 A:middle
design sound for a button?

00:22:30.366 --> 00:22:32.046 A:middle
Well we can start by taking a

00:22:32.046 --> 00:22:33.396 A:middle
little detour and looking at

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:35.816 A:middle
some real-world buttons.

00:22:37.076 --> 00:22:40.416 A:middle
Some of them are made of cheap

00:22:40.686 --> 00:22:42.976 A:middle
materials and sound like this,

00:22:43.726 --> 00:22:45.416 A:middle
while others are made of high

00:22:45.416 --> 00:22:47.116 A:middle
quality materials and sound like

00:22:47.796 --> 00:22:47.986 A:middle
this.

00:22:48.896 --> 00:22:49.996 A:middle
Well this was actually a

00:22:50.356 --> 00:22:52.436 A:middle
recording of the volume button

00:22:52.486 --> 00:22:54.606 A:middle
on an iPhone X, of course we

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:56.306 A:middle
amplified it quite a bit.

00:22:58.576 --> 00:23:00.316 A:middle
These sounds though are


00:22:58.576 --> 00:23:00.316 A:middle
These sounds though are

00:23:00.316 --> 00:23:02.546 A:middle
essentially byproducts, they're

00:23:02.546 --> 00:23:05.156 A:middle
not necessarily designed they're

00:23:05.156 --> 00:23:06.746 A:middle
defined by the materials these

00:23:06.746 --> 00:23:07.966 A:middle
buttons are made of.

00:23:09.326 --> 00:23:10.766 A:middle
But because we're designed for

00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:11.726 A:middle
software we have a lot of

00:23:11.726 --> 00:23:15.846 A:middle
freedom, so we can choose to not

00:23:15.886 --> 00:23:18.016 A:middle
play any sounds at all and often

00:23:18.016 --> 00:23:18.926 A:middle
that is what we do.

00:23:19.466 --> 00:23:23.566 A:middle
But if we do decide it's useful

00:23:23.566 --> 00:23:27.026 A:middle
to add sounds to UI elements

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:29.126 A:middle
then we can take cues from

00:23:29.126 --> 00:23:31.666 A:middle
real-world analogs to add

00:23:31.696 --> 00:23:34.166 A:middle
meaning to these UI sounds and

00:23:34.726 --> 00:23:36.106 A:middle
to help our users understand

00:23:39.236 --> 00:23:39.396 A:middle
them.

00:23:39.546 --> 00:23:40.876 A:middle
Now do you want to add sound to

00:23:40.876 --> 00:23:41.246 A:middle
your app?

00:23:41.246 --> 00:23:44.086 A:middle
Well it depends, think about

00:23:44.086 --> 00:23:46.456 A:middle
category your app falls in, who

00:23:46.536 --> 00:23:48.226 A:middle
will use the app and what will

00:23:48.226 --> 00:23:51.586 A:middle
their expectations be, and what

00:23:51.586 --> 00:23:52.836 A:middle
is the context, where will the

00:23:52.836 --> 00:23:53.716 A:middle
app be used.

00:23:54.456 --> 00:23:57.386 A:middle
For our app we know it will be

00:23:57.386 --> 00:23:59.256 A:middle
used by people who like to eat

00:23:59.296 --> 00:24:01.676 A:middle
toast and they're used to making


00:23:59.296 --> 00:24:01.676 A:middle
toast and they're used to making

00:24:01.676 --> 00:24:03.996 A:middle
toast in the kitchen, but from

00:24:03.996 --> 00:24:05.186 A:middle
now on they can make it from

00:24:05.186 --> 00:24:07.686 A:middle
anywhere in the house.

00:24:07.886 --> 00:24:10.026 A:middle
They can still though use the

00:24:10.026 --> 00:24:11.546 A:middle
audible cues they're used to

00:24:11.546 --> 00:24:12.656 A:middle
getting from their toaster in

00:24:12.656 --> 00:24:14.756 A:middle
the kitchen, so for that reason

00:24:15.116 --> 00:24:17.286 A:middle
we think that this app is a

00:24:17.286 --> 00:24:19.416 A:middle
perfect candidate for the use of

00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:21.066 A:middle
sound.

00:24:21.216 --> 00:24:24.296 A:middle
So let's look at the process of

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:27.206 A:middle
making toast and listen to

00:24:27.206 --> 00:24:28.346 A:middle
sounds we encounter.

00:24:30.316 --> 00:24:32.396 A:middle
Let's define if these sounds are

00:24:32.396 --> 00:24:35.046 A:middle
useful and if they are if we

00:24:35.046 --> 00:24:36.386 A:middle
want to use them in our design.

00:24:36.466 --> 00:24:39.366 A:middle
So we'll use Julian's timeline

00:24:39.366 --> 00:24:41.786 A:middle
for this and listen to the

00:24:41.786 --> 00:24:43.576 A:middle
sounds that this toaster makes.

00:24:44.856 --> 00:24:47.396 A:middle
First, we pull down the lever

00:24:48.406 --> 00:24:51.336 A:middle
and then we press it in place.

00:24:53.596 --> 00:24:55.516 A:middle
Now what we hear then is the

00:24:55.746 --> 00:24:57.286 A:middle
toaster heating up with a subtle

00:24:57.286 --> 00:24:58.736 A:middle
buzzing sound of the coil.

00:24:59.516 --> 00:25:02.586 A:middle
[ Buzzing Sound ]


00:24:59.516 --> 00:25:02.586 A:middle
[ Buzzing Sound ]

00:25:03.086 --> 00:25:06.906 A:middle
Until our toast is done and the

00:25:06.906 --> 00:25:09.786 A:middle
toaster ejects the toast.

00:25:09.866 --> 00:25:11.256 A:middle
Now let's go through these steps

00:25:11.896 --> 00:25:12.956 A:middle
one by one.

00:25:17.046 --> 00:25:18.056 A:middle
First, when we pull down the

00:25:18.056 --> 00:25:21.736 A:middle
lever we feel the resistance of

00:25:21.736 --> 00:25:23.096 A:middle
the spring while we push it

00:25:23.096 --> 00:25:25.496 A:middle
down, it's almost like if we

00:25:25.496 --> 00:25:26.716 A:middle
compare it to what happens in

00:25:26.716 --> 00:25:28.886 A:middle
our app it's like designing

00:25:29.316 --> 00:25:32.026 A:middle
sound haptics and animation and

00:25:32.226 --> 00:25:33.316 A:middle
synchronizing them all.

00:25:33.716 --> 00:25:35.826 A:middle
But in our app, we decided to

00:25:35.826 --> 00:25:36.806 A:middle
replace this with a simple

00:25:36.806 --> 00:25:38.736 A:middle
button so we don't need to

00:25:39.126 --> 00:25:40.216 A:middle
design a sound for it.

00:25:41.236 --> 00:25:43.616 A:middle
And when we request the toast

00:25:43.616 --> 00:25:44.496 A:middle
that is when we press our

00:25:44.496 --> 00:25:47.176 A:middle
button, the next step, and that

00:25:47.176 --> 00:25:48.596 A:middle
is what Julian asked me to

00:25:48.596 --> 00:25:50.446 A:middle
design a sound for so let's get

00:25:50.446 --> 00:25:51.856 A:middle
to work on that.

00:25:52.816 --> 00:25:57.046 A:middle
We can record sounds, we can use

00:25:57.166 --> 00:25:58.436 A:middle
electronic instruments,

00:25:58.606 --> 00:26:01.096 A:middle
synthesizers to generate sounds


00:25:58.606 --> 00:26:01.096 A:middle
synthesizers to generate sounds

00:26:01.096 --> 00:26:03.826 A:middle
and then we can use software to

00:26:03.826 --> 00:26:05.986 A:middle
scope these sounds into the

00:26:05.986 --> 00:26:06.506 A:middle
right shape.

00:26:06.676 --> 00:26:07.796 A:middle
Now I'm not going into great

00:26:07.796 --> 00:26:09.086 A:middle
detail about this today, but

00:26:09.856 --> 00:26:11.226 A:middle
please watch last year's talk

00:26:11.466 --> 00:26:13.206 A:middle
Designing Sound if you want to

00:26:13.206 --> 00:26:14.436 A:middle
learn more about this process.

00:26:14.876 --> 00:26:17.746 A:middle
In the end, we came up with

00:26:17.746 --> 00:26:18.896 A:middle
three different options.

00:26:20.086 --> 00:26:24.856 A:middle
This is option A, this is option

00:26:26.116 --> 00:26:32.026 A:middle
B, and this is option C.

00:26:32.276 --> 00:26:34.856 A:middle
Okay now option A is quite

00:26:34.856 --> 00:26:38.026 A:middle
minimalist, it's so simple, it

00:26:38.026 --> 00:26:39.366 A:middle
works pretty well with the

00:26:39.366 --> 00:26:44.606 A:middle
simple UI of the app but it

00:26:44.606 --> 00:26:45.746 A:middle
feels like there's something

00:26:45.746 --> 00:26:46.156 A:middle
missing.

00:26:46.496 --> 00:26:48.236 A:middle
And we found out that while we

00:26:48.236 --> 00:26:49.386 A:middle
were designing these that it's

00:26:49.386 --> 00:26:51.076 A:middle
much more satisfying if these

00:26:51.076 --> 00:26:53.426 A:middle
sounds have two clicks, one when

00:26:53.426 --> 00:26:54.886 A:middle
you press down and one when you

00:26:54.886 --> 00:26:55.716 A:middle
lift off your finger.

00:26:57.236 --> 00:26:59.796 A:middle
Now option B has this character,


00:27:01.026 --> 00:27:04.276 A:middle
but and now it is a sound that's

00:27:04.276 --> 00:27:06.806 A:middle
much more realistic, it doesn't

00:27:06.806 --> 00:27:08.136 A:middle
really sound like a toaster but

00:27:08.136 --> 00:27:09.206 A:middle
it does have this physical

00:27:09.326 --> 00:27:10.176 A:middle
quality to it.

00:27:11.066 --> 00:27:12.586 A:middle
For the same reason though it

00:27:12.586 --> 00:27:14.126 A:middle
does sound a little harsh and a

00:27:14.126 --> 00:27:15.366 A:middle
little metallic.

00:27:15.366 --> 00:27:20.006 A:middle
And then there's option C, it's

00:27:22.116 --> 00:27:25.166 A:middle
a bit of an odd one but it does

00:27:25.166 --> 00:27:27.196 A:middle
have character and it's a sound

00:27:27.196 --> 00:27:28.376 A:middle
that I would recognize if I hear

00:27:28.376 --> 00:27:32.326 A:middle
it again if I use my app again.

00:27:32.426 --> 00:27:33.346 A:middle
Another thing that's good about

00:27:33.346 --> 00:27:35.036 A:middle
this sound is that it has this

00:27:35.536 --> 00:27:37.106 A:middle
tonal confirmation built in,

00:27:37.106 --> 00:27:38.696 A:middle
it's like throwing a checkmark

00:27:38.696 --> 00:27:40.006 A:middle
telling you your action

00:27:40.006 --> 00:27:40.546 A:middle
succeeded.

00:27:40.746 --> 00:27:41.866 A:middle
I'll play it one more time see

00:27:41.866 --> 00:27:42.606 A:middle
if you can hear this.

00:27:43.216 --> 00:27:47.306 A:middle
And for all these reasons I

00:27:47.306 --> 00:27:50.386 A:middle
think that option C is the one I

00:27:50.716 --> 00:27:53.776 A:middle
would recommend going for, it's

00:27:54.286 --> 00:27:56.506 A:middle
a simple sound, it has a

00:27:56.686 --> 00:27:59.366 A:middle
friendly character, and it's

00:27:59.366 --> 00:28:00.286 A:middle
something unique it's not


00:27:59.366 --> 00:28:00.286 A:middle
something unique it's not

00:28:00.286 --> 00:28:01.976 A:middle
something I'd recognize from any

00:28:01.976 --> 00:28:04.246 A:middle
other app.

00:28:05.216 --> 00:28:06.626 A:middle
Okay so it looks like we're

00:28:06.626 --> 00:28:09.176 A:middle
done, at least we made our

00:28:09.176 --> 00:28:12.006 A:middle
button click but we're not done

00:28:12.006 --> 00:28:12.816 A:middle
making toast yet.

00:28:12.876 --> 00:28:16.036 A:middle
So let's keep going, maybe there

00:28:16.036 --> 00:28:17.686 A:middle
are some other opportunities for

00:28:17.686 --> 00:28:19.416 A:middle
the use of sounds in this app.

00:28:19.586 --> 00:28:20.886 A:middle
Now as good sound designers we

00:28:20.886 --> 00:28:22.166 A:middle
want to tell the whole story.

00:28:23.496 --> 00:28:26.556 A:middle
So after pressing our button the

00:28:26.556 --> 00:28:27.986 A:middle
toaster heats up and we hear

00:28:27.986 --> 00:28:29.896 A:middle
this subtle buzzing sound.

00:28:30.446 --> 00:28:34.946 A:middle
Now we can -- is this helpful at

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:36.186 A:middle
all this sound?

00:28:36.476 --> 00:28:38.076 A:middle
Maybe, it tells us something

00:28:38.076 --> 00:28:39.986 A:middle
about the state of the device.

00:28:40.686 --> 00:28:42.926 A:middle
So we can choose to play a sound

00:28:43.296 --> 00:28:44.766 A:middle
that resembles this on our app

00:28:44.766 --> 00:28:46.126 A:middle
as well, maybe a continuous

00:28:46.126 --> 00:28:47.886 A:middle
sound, something like this.

00:28:48.516 --> 00:28:51.546 A:middle
[ Notification Sound ]

00:28:52.046 --> 00:28:53.436 A:middle
But making toast may take

00:28:53.436 --> 00:28:55.006 A:middle
several minutes and having this

00:28:55.006 --> 00:28:56.636 A:middle
sound play over and over again

00:28:57.276 --> 00:28:58.666 A:middle
might not be the experience

00:28:58.666 --> 00:28:59.466 A:middle
we're looking for right.


00:29:00.326 --> 00:29:01.616 A:middle
So how about something a little

00:29:01.616 --> 00:29:03.226 A:middle
more subtle like a timer sound

00:29:03.226 --> 00:29:05.096 A:middle
that fades in and out every half

00:29:05.096 --> 00:29:06.476 A:middle
a minute or so.

00:29:08.776 --> 00:29:09.596 A:middle
That could work.

00:29:09.596 --> 00:29:12.456 A:middle
But does this really need a

00:29:12.456 --> 00:29:13.926 A:middle
sound at all because what we're

00:29:13.986 --> 00:29:15.716 A:middle
really waiting for is what comes

00:29:15.716 --> 00:29:16.866 A:middle
next, that's when our toast is

00:29:16.916 --> 00:29:18.476 A:middle
done and this is what we want to

00:29:18.476 --> 00:29:20.796 A:middle
notify our users about, that's

00:29:20.866 --> 00:29:21.906 A:middle
the important moment.

00:29:22.696 --> 00:29:25.436 A:middle
So we want to play a clean and

00:29:25.436 --> 00:29:27.886 A:middle
simple notification sound that

00:29:27.886 --> 00:29:29.886 A:middle
they won't miss, something like

00:29:29.886 --> 00:29:29.976 A:middle

[ Notification Sound ]

00:29:32.866 --> 00:29:34.736 A:middle
Okay so now let's listen to

00:29:34.736 --> 00:29:35.726 A:middle
these sounds together.

00:29:36.756 --> 00:29:38.946 A:middle
First, we press our button and

00:29:41.576 --> 00:29:43.196 A:middle
then we decided for the next

00:29:43.196 --> 00:29:44.926 A:middle
step when the process is active

00:29:44.926 --> 00:29:46.066 A:middle
we don't really need a sound

00:29:46.276 --> 00:29:47.986 A:middle
until we get our notification

00:29:47.986 --> 00:29:49.426 A:middle
and the toast is done.

00:29:50.466 --> 00:29:51.956 A:middle
And it's important to listen to

00:29:51.956 --> 00:29:54.566 A:middle
these sounds together to make

00:29:54.566 --> 00:29:56.066 A:middle
sure they family well together

00:29:56.636 --> 00:29:58.486 A:middle
because this is how our app

00:29:58.486 --> 00:30:00.136 A:middle
communicates to its users, this


00:29:58.486 --> 00:30:00.136 A:middle
communicates to its users, this

00:30:00.136 --> 00:30:01.966 A:middle
is the voice of our app.

00:30:06.046 --> 00:30:08.316 A:middle
So now our app is in good shape.

00:30:08.806 --> 00:30:10.396 A:middle
I'd like to tell you about some

00:30:10.696 --> 00:30:12.296 A:middle
key building blocks of sound

00:30:13.186 --> 00:30:15.596 A:middle
that we use when designing any

00:30:15.596 --> 00:30:16.246 A:middle
kind of sound.

00:30:16.416 --> 00:30:19.216 A:middle
The first one is timbre or tone

00:30:19.216 --> 00:30:19.606 A:middle
color.

00:30:19.606 --> 00:30:22.876 A:middle
And most of you will instantly

00:30:23.226 --> 00:30:26.336 A:middle
recognize this one.

00:30:26.566 --> 00:30:29.366 A:middle
It's a piano right, but how do

00:30:29.366 --> 00:30:30.986 A:middle
we know it's a piano?

00:30:31.776 --> 00:30:34.206 A:middle
How do we know it's not a

00:30:34.206 --> 00:30:34.856 A:middle
vibraphone?

00:30:34.856 --> 00:30:40.706 A:middle
It's determined by the material

00:30:40.706 --> 00:30:45.126 A:middle
an instrument is made of, by its

00:30:45.126 --> 00:30:47.296 A:middle
shape, and how it's being played

00:30:47.296 --> 00:30:49.916 A:middle
using a mallet, a hammer, a bow

00:30:49.916 --> 00:30:50.816 A:middle
or your hands.

00:30:51.766 --> 00:30:52.966 A:middle
So these instruments can play

00:30:52.966 --> 00:30:54.996 A:middle
exactly the same tone but sound

00:30:55.146 --> 00:30:55.916 A:middle
very different.

00:30:56.476 --> 00:30:58.426 A:middle
Now for our app we decided to go

00:30:58.426 --> 00:31:00.396 A:middle
for a character, for a timbre


00:30:58.426 --> 00:31:00.396 A:middle
for a character, for a timbre

00:31:00.396 --> 00:31:02.266 A:middle
that is friendly and it's not

00:31:02.266 --> 00:31:04.726 A:middle
too harsh or metallic.

00:31:06.456 --> 00:31:09.326 A:middle
The next one is frequency or the

00:31:09.376 --> 00:31:10.236 A:middle
pitch of the sound.

00:31:11.136 --> 00:31:12.656 A:middle
Some instruments play at very

00:31:12.656 --> 00:31:15.746 A:middle
high frequencies and others play

00:31:15.746 --> 00:31:17.016 A:middle
at very low frequencies.

00:31:19.456 --> 00:31:22.856 A:middle
But also nonmusical sounds can

00:31:22.856 --> 00:31:24.696 A:middle
be played at very high or low

00:31:24.696 --> 00:31:25.386 A:middle
frequencies.

00:31:25.666 --> 00:31:28.106 A:middle
And when we do this it gives an

00:31:28.106 --> 00:31:31.406 A:middle
indication of the size of an

00:31:31.406 --> 00:31:31.766 A:middle
object.

00:31:32.076 --> 00:31:35.756 A:middle
So if we take our toaster and we

00:31:35.756 --> 00:31:39.326 A:middle
record the toast eject sound, we

00:31:39.326 --> 00:31:40.816 A:middle
play it at a very high frequency

00:31:41.116 --> 00:31:42.426 A:middle
it sounds like a tiny little

00:31:42.466 --> 00:31:42.776 A:middle
toaster.

00:31:43.956 --> 00:31:47.316 A:middle
But if we take the same sound

00:31:48.106 --> 00:31:49.626 A:middle
and play it at a low frequency

00:31:50.546 --> 00:31:52.556 A:middle
it sounds like this big giant

00:31:52.696 --> 00:31:52.976 A:middle
toaster.

00:31:59.776 --> 00:32:02.886 A:middle
So next up is duration or the


00:31:59.776 --> 00:32:02.886 A:middle
So next up is duration or the

00:32:02.886 --> 00:32:04.036 A:middle
length of a sound.

00:32:05.436 --> 00:32:08.886 A:middle
Sounds can be very short or ring

00:32:08.886 --> 00:32:09.836 A:middle
out much longer.

00:32:09.946 --> 00:32:15.646 A:middle
And if we design UI sound and we

00:32:15.646 --> 00:32:17.316 A:middle
know our button is going to be

00:32:17.316 --> 00:32:19.546 A:middle
pressed a lot of times in a row

00:32:20.006 --> 00:32:22.056 A:middle
it's important for this sound to

00:32:22.056 --> 00:32:23.816 A:middle
be very short and subtle.

00:32:25.286 --> 00:32:26.526 A:middle
But if it's only pressed once in

00:32:26.526 --> 00:32:27.616 A:middle
a while, which is actually the

00:32:27.616 --> 00:32:29.356 A:middle
case for our toast app, it's

00:32:29.356 --> 00:32:30.706 A:middle
okay if it's a little longer, if

00:32:30.706 --> 00:32:32.546 A:middle
it's a little more elaborate.

00:32:33.806 --> 00:32:38.066 A:middle
In fact, this sound only plays

00:32:38.066 --> 00:32:40.706 A:middle
once every time we use our app.

00:32:42.096 --> 00:32:44.986 A:middle
And then there's loudness or

00:32:44.986 --> 00:32:46.356 A:middle
amplitude or volume.

00:32:47.796 --> 00:32:50.316 A:middle
Now when we design ringtones or

00:32:50.316 --> 00:32:53.156 A:middle
alarm sounds we don't want our

00:32:53.156 --> 00:32:55.496 A:middle
users to miss them, we don't

00:32:55.496 --> 00:32:56.596 A:middle
want them to miss their phone

00:32:56.596 --> 00:32:58.016 A:middle
calls or sleep through their

00:32:58.016 --> 00:32:58.496 A:middle
alarms.

[ Notification Sound ]

Our audio engineer Mitch is

00:33:05.426 --> 00:33:06.276 A:middle
calling me from the back of the

00:33:06.276 --> 00:33:09.256 A:middle
room and I hear it loud and

00:33:09.256 --> 00:33:10.006 A:middle
clear.

00:33:10.496 --> 00:33:12.226 A:middle
But if a UI sound would be loud

00:33:12.226 --> 00:33:14.236 A:middle
like this it would become

00:33:14.386 --> 00:33:15.036 A:middle
unpleasant.

00:33:15.576 --> 00:33:18.276 A:middle
It only needs add this subtle

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:19.596 A:middle
[inaudible] layer to the

00:33:19.596 --> 00:33:20.236 A:middle
interaction.

00:33:20.876 --> 00:33:22.486 A:middle

[ Keyboard Sound ]

00:33:32.046 --> 00:33:33.796 A:middle
Now if I would miss this

00:33:33.846 --> 00:33:35.196 A:middle
keyboard sound because I'm in a

00:33:35.196 --> 00:33:37.006 A:middle
noisy environment it's not a

00:33:37.006 --> 00:33:39.046 A:middle
real big problem, but I

00:33:39.046 --> 00:33:40.736 A:middle
definitely don't want to miss my

00:33:40.736 --> 00:33:41.286 A:middle
ringtones.

00:33:43.836 --> 00:33:46.226 A:middle
So to recap the four building

00:33:46.226 --> 00:33:48.866 A:middle
blocks of sound, our timbre,

00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:52.226 A:middle

loudness.

And when you start thinking

00:33:54.736 --> 00:33:56.766 A:middle
about designing sounds and

00:33:56.766 --> 00:33:58.666 A:middle
adding sounds to your app it's

00:33:58.666 --> 00:33:59.686 A:middle
really good to keep these in

00:33:59.686 --> 00:34:00.076 A:middle
mind.


00:33:59.686 --> 00:34:00.076 A:middle
mind.

00:34:00.546 --> 00:34:03.826 A:middle
And that concludes what I want

00:34:03.826 --> 00:34:05.036 A:middle
to tell you about sound today,

00:34:06.056 --> 00:34:08.476 A:middle
but before we end the session

00:34:09.746 --> 00:34:11.775 A:middle
these are the most important

00:34:11.806 --> 00:34:14.065 A:middle
things that Julian and I want to

00:34:14.065 --> 00:34:16.985 A:middle
leave you with.

00:34:17.186 --> 00:34:20.166 A:middle
Details are designed even if

00:34:20.166 --> 00:34:22.396 A:middle
they seem obvious, even if

00:34:22.436 --> 00:34:24.196 A:middle
they're as simple as a button,

00:34:25.206 --> 00:34:27.176 A:middle
even if they're as simple as a

00:34:27.226 --> 00:34:27.846 A:middle
click sound.

00:34:30.016 --> 00:34:31.686 A:middle
Now you can take inspiration

00:34:32.146 --> 00:34:35.696 A:middle
from real-world elements, but

00:34:35.696 --> 00:34:36.926 A:middle
there's no need to copy them

00:34:37.196 --> 00:34:39.005 A:middle
one-to-one.

00:34:39.186 --> 00:34:41.606 A:middle
Also use the freedom and the

00:34:41.606 --> 00:34:43.085 A:middle
flexibility of designing for

00:34:43.085 --> 00:34:44.216 A:middle
software to create something

00:34:44.216 --> 00:34:47.096 A:middle
that is completely unique and

00:34:47.096 --> 00:34:47.585 A:middle
fresh.

00:34:47.956 --> 00:34:53.136 A:middle
And then what we see, the

00:34:53.436 --> 00:34:56.176 A:middle
animation, and what we feel, the

00:34:56.176 --> 00:34:58.216 A:middle
haptics, and what we hear, the

00:34:58.216 --> 00:35:00.766 A:middle
sound, they all combine into


00:34:58.216 --> 00:35:00.766 A:middle
sound, they all combine into

00:35:00.766 --> 00:35:02.986 A:middle
this one single experience.

00:35:04.476 --> 00:35:07.466 A:middle
And lastly, but most

00:35:07.466 --> 00:35:10.286 A:middle
importantly, learn by trying

00:35:10.286 --> 00:35:10.836 A:middle
things out.

00:35:12.256 --> 00:35:13.576 A:middle
You know we tried out a lot of

00:35:13.576 --> 00:35:16.316 A:middle
things today and some of them

00:35:16.846 --> 00:35:18.846 A:middle
didn't work that well while

00:35:18.846 --> 00:35:19.766 A:middle
others worked great.

00:35:20.446 --> 00:35:21.916 A:middle
But the only way for us to find

00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:23.776 A:middle
out was to try them out first.

00:35:26.256 --> 00:35:28.896 A:middle
Now I hope this all inspired you

00:35:30.096 --> 00:35:31.976 A:middle
to spend some more time on the

00:35:31.976 --> 00:35:33.916 A:middle
details you might normally take

00:35:33.916 --> 00:35:34.476 A:middle
for granted.

00:35:35.936 --> 00:35:37.886 A:middle
If you get these details right

00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:41.076 A:middle
it can make your apps even more
