[ Music ]

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:23.076 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:23.576 --> 00:00:23.986 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:24.976 A:middle
Good afternoon.

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:25.786 A:middle
And welcome.

00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:27.106 A:middle
My name is Michele.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.146 A:middle
And I work in the iOS User

00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:30.096 A:middle
Notifications team.

00:00:30.446 --> 00:00:32.695 A:middle
Just a few minutes ago, my

00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:34.426 A:middle
coworkers Kritarth and Teja

00:00:34.646 --> 00:00:35.346 A:middle
[phonetic names] introduced you

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:36.706 A:middle
to group notifications.

00:00:36.926 --> 00:00:38.306 A:middle
And in this session, we're going

00:00:38.306 --> 00:00:39.826 A:middle
to explore a little bit more

00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:42.046 A:middle
detail in-- this feature in a

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:42.936 A:middle
little bit more detail.

00:00:43.016 --> 00:00:44.596 A:middle
And we'll learn how to use it

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:47.246 A:middle
and how to improve the

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:48.706 A:middle
efficiency of your notification

00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:49.746 A:middle
and how to make them better

00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:50.206 A:middle
organized.

00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:54.926 A:middle
We will start by a brief

00:00:54.926 --> 00:00:56.236 A:middle
overview of how the feature

00:00:56.236 --> 00:00:57.866 A:middle
works and how the different

00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:58.996 A:middle
parts of the UI work.

00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:01.466 A:middle
Then we'll look at the default


00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:01.466 A:middle
Then we'll look at the default

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.896 A:middle
grouping, app grouping.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.476 A:middle
We will see how to create custom

00:01:05.476 --> 00:01:07.416 A:middle
groups for your notifications so

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:09.606 A:middle
that you can adapt the groups to

00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:11.736 A:middle
the content of your apps.

00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:13.896 A:middle
And finally, we will learn how

00:01:13.896 --> 00:01:15.616 A:middle
to create custom summaries for

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:17.256 A:middle
your new notification groups.

00:01:21.796 --> 00:01:22.636 A:middle
Let's start with a brief

00:01:22.636 --> 00:01:24.186 A:middle
overview of the UI of the

00:01:24.186 --> 00:01:24.596 A:middle
feature.

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:29.346 A:middle
Notification groups collect sets

00:01:29.346 --> 00:01:30.846 A:middle
of different notifications

00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:32.326 A:middle
together and in a group, and

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:33.926 A:middle
group them in a small stack.

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:36.276 A:middle
This helps making Notification

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:38.126 A:middle
Center better organized and more

00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:39.966 A:middle
efficient for the user so that

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.886 A:middle
he can see more notifications at

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:42.726 A:middle
the same time.

00:01:42.726 --> 00:01:44.436 A:middle
Without any app taking over the

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:46.716 A:middle
entire screen and preventing

00:01:46.716 --> 00:01:47.946 A:middle
them from seeing some of the

00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:48.576 A:middle
content.

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:52.666 A:middle
Each notification group shows

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.166 A:middle
the most recent notification

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:55.646 A:middle
that was delivered to that group

00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:56.536 A:middle
at the top.

00:01:56.536 --> 00:01:58.016 A:middle
And we call these the leading

00:01:58.106 --> 00:01:58.876 A:middle
notification.


00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:02.186 A:middle
Right underneath each group

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:04.676 A:middle
shows a brief summary that gives

00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:06.436 A:middle
a little bit more details about

00:02:06.436 --> 00:02:07.686 A:middle
what are the notifications

00:02:07.686 --> 00:02:08.666 A:middle
included in the group.

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:11.346 A:middle
Gives you a number for, so you

00:02:11.346 --> 00:02:12.866 A:middle
have a measure of how many

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.186 A:middle
notifications are inside.

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:16.586 A:middle
And in some cases, also some

00:02:16.586 --> 00:02:18.016 A:middle
details about the content of

00:02:18.016 --> 00:02:18.976 A:middle
those notifications.

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:24.846 A:middle
Notification groups also help in

00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:26.096 A:middle
triaging notification.

00:02:26.096 --> 00:02:27.226 A:middle
Because for example you can

00:02:27.256 --> 00:02:29.066 A:middle
clear them, all the notification

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.736 A:middle
in that group with just one

00:02:30.736 --> 00:02:31.226 A:middle
slide.

00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:32.546 A:middle
And clear them all.

00:02:34.016 --> 00:02:36.386 A:middle
But it's just as easy to expand

00:02:36.386 --> 00:02:37.706 A:middle
the group and see all the

00:02:37.706 --> 00:02:39.126 A:middle
notifications that are inside.

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:41.096 A:middle
And read one of them at a time

00:02:41.096 --> 00:02:42.296 A:middle
and maybe clear one.

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:44.266 A:middle
And then when you're done, you

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:46.046 A:middle
can clear all of them, all of

00:02:46.046 --> 00:02:47.236 A:middle
the group using the group

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:48.806 A:middle
buttons at the top.

00:02:52.206 --> 00:02:54.136 A:middle
This was a very brief overview

00:02:54.456 --> 00:02:55.946 A:middle
of the feature just to get more

00:02:57.576 --> 00:02:59.286 A:middle
accustomed to the different

00:02:59.286 --> 00:03:00.666 A:middle
parts of the UI and the


00:02:59.286 --> 00:03:00.666 A:middle
parts of the UI and the

00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:01.306 A:middle
terminology.

00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:04.206 A:middle
So now allow, now let's see how

00:03:04.206 --> 00:03:05.426 A:middle
the groups work and how they are

00:03:05.426 --> 00:03:06.466 A:middle
created.

00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:09.236 A:middle
The default behavior is app

00:03:09.236 --> 00:03:09.676 A:middle
grouping.

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:13.676 A:middle
Each app gets its own group.

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:15.376 A:middle
And all the notifications from

00:03:15.376 --> 00:03:16.526 A:middle
that app go to that group.

00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:18.226 A:middle
This is the behavior that you

00:03:18.226 --> 00:03:19.726 A:middle
get if you don't do anything.

00:03:19.726 --> 00:03:20.796 A:middle
And you just keep sending

00:03:20.796 --> 00:03:24.396 A:middle
notifications without adopting

00:03:24.396 --> 00:03:25.086 A:middle
any new APIs.

00:03:27.296 --> 00:03:29.926 A:middle
In many situations, app groups

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:31.476 A:middle
are sufficient, and they work

00:03:31.476 --> 00:03:32.066 A:middle
very well.

00:03:32.426 --> 00:03:33.956 A:middle
For example, as you see here in

00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:35.446 A:middle
the Podcasts app, all the

00:03:35.446 --> 00:03:36.746 A:middle
notifications are in the same

00:03:36.746 --> 00:03:39.266 A:middle
group because Podcasts sends

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:41.376 A:middle
notifications that are very

00:03:41.376 --> 00:03:41.786 A:middle
similar.

00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:43.596 A:middle
They're notifications for new

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:45.006 A:middle
episodes of [inaudible] the

00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:45.426 A:middle
shows.

00:03:46.076 --> 00:03:47.716 A:middle
So there's no specific

00:03:47.716 --> 00:03:49.046 A:middle
notification that is more

00:03:49.046 --> 00:03:50.556 A:middle
interesting or something that is

00:03:50.556 --> 00:03:52.176 A:middle
more important to show

00:03:52.176 --> 00:03:52.706 A:middle
differently.

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:56.856 A:middle
As I said, as we said, it's very

00:03:56.856 --> 00:03:58.896 A:middle
easy to tap on the group, expand

00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:00.666 A:middle
it, and see the details inside


00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:00.666 A:middle
it, and see the details inside

00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:00.976 A:middle
the group.

00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:08.606 A:middle
So app grouping is good.

00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:10.416 A:middle
It keeps notifications more

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.626 A:middle
organized and Notification

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:13.286 A:middle
Center more compact and easier

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:13.776 A:middle
to use.

00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:17.726 A:middle
But many apps have more specific

00:04:17.726 --> 00:04:18.245 A:middle
content.

00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:20.136 A:middle
They may need different

00:04:20.136 --> 00:04:21.716 A:middle
organization to make

00:04:21.716 --> 00:04:23.546 A:middle
notifications more efficient.

00:04:24.646 --> 00:04:26.866 A:middle
And so we can create custom

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:27.206 A:middle
grouping.

00:04:28.036 --> 00:04:29.436 A:middle
So in this session we will see

00:04:29.746 --> 00:04:32.876 A:middle
first the API to create custom

00:04:32.876 --> 00:04:34.226 A:middle
groups for your notifications.

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:36.296 A:middle
And then we'll look at a few

00:04:36.296 --> 00:04:41.546 A:middle
examples of apps in iOS 12 to

00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:42.966 A:middle
explore some of the patterns

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:45.346 A:middle
that they applied, and how they

00:04:45.736 --> 00:04:47.846 A:middle
tried to balance the amount of

00:04:47.906 --> 00:04:49.226 A:middle
content that was visible to the

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:49.696 A:middle
user.

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:50.796 A:middle
And the amount of content that

00:04:50.796 --> 00:04:53.476 A:middle
was grouped together to help

00:04:53.476 --> 00:04:54.416 A:middle
with the organization of

00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:55.976 A:middle
Notification Center.

00:04:57.456 --> 00:04:59.646 A:middle
So this is how you create a

00:04:59.646 --> 00:05:01.826 A:middle
group for your app.


00:04:59.646 --> 00:05:01.826 A:middle
group for your app.

00:05:02.416 --> 00:05:04.166 A:middle
You just set a custom thread

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:05.746 A:middle
identifier in the notification

00:05:05.746 --> 00:05:06.246 A:middle
content.

00:05:08.386 --> 00:05:10.236 A:middle
After you've done this, all the

00:05:10.236 --> 00:05:11.766 A:middle
notifications that you send with

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:14.036 A:middle
the same thread identifier will

00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:15.926 A:middle
be grouped together in

00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:16.806 A:middle
Notification Center.

00:05:18.636 --> 00:05:20.426 A:middle
The thread identifier can be any

00:05:20.426 --> 00:05:20.846 A:middle
string.

00:05:21.986 --> 00:05:22.966 A:middle
Doesn't matter what you said

00:05:22.966 --> 00:05:23.296 A:middle
there.

00:05:23.946 --> 00:05:25.436 A:middle
But all of the notification will

00:05:25.436 --> 00:05:26.096 A:middle
be grouped together.

00:05:26.536 --> 00:05:28.606 A:middle
You just need to be unique.

00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:30.236 A:middle
You just need a unique string

00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:31.756 A:middle
that is identifier's group.

00:05:32.596 --> 00:05:33.646 A:middle
And that is it.

00:05:34.216 --> 00:05:35.646 A:middle
You created a groups for your

00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:36.386 A:middle
notifications.

00:05:37.606 --> 00:05:40.836 A:middle
But given that it is so simple,

00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:43.306 A:middle
we need to pay attention at how

00:05:43.306 --> 00:05:44.626 A:middle
we create these groups.

00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:47.656 A:middle
And also, if you're familiar

00:05:47.656 --> 00:05:49.796 A:middle
with notifications API, you

00:05:49.796 --> 00:05:51.156 A:middle
notice that this is not a new

00:05:51.156 --> 00:05:51.386 A:middle
API.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:52.936 A:middle
This is an API that we

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:54.906 A:middle
introduced in previous iOS

00:05:54.906 --> 00:05:55.316 A:middle
releases.

00:05:55.316 --> 00:05:57.256 A:middle
So it's a really existing and

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:58.426 A:middle
current iOS.

00:05:58.936 --> 00:06:00.726 A:middle
We introduced it to, for


00:05:58.936 --> 00:06:00.726 A:middle
We introduced it to, for

00:06:00.966 --> 00:06:02.386 A:middle
[inaudible] notifications and

00:06:02.386 --> 00:06:03.876 A:middle
for private notifications.

00:06:04.336 --> 00:06:05.786 A:middle
So if you already adopted this

00:06:05.786 --> 00:06:08.096 A:middle
API to support these two other

00:06:08.096 --> 00:06:09.666 A:middle
features in previous iOS

00:06:09.666 --> 00:06:10.176 A:middle
releases.

00:06:10.466 --> 00:06:11.996 A:middle
Your notifications are already

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:14.566 A:middle
grouping today in iOS 12.

00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:17.346 A:middle
You may want to review how the

00:06:17.346 --> 00:06:18.796 A:middle
groups are created since now the

00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:19.926 A:middle
context is a little bit

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:20.356 A:middle
different.

00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:23.316 A:middle
So it may be useful to adjust

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:24.526 A:middle
them a little bit.

00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:28.136 A:middle
So in this example, you see how

00:06:28.136 --> 00:06:29.456 A:middle
to create a thread, set a thread

00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:30.616 A:middle
identifier on a local

00:06:30.616 --> 00:06:31.356 A:middle
notification.

00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:34.196 A:middle
And of course you can set it on

00:06:34.196 --> 00:06:35.726 A:middle
a push payload for push

00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:36.536 A:middle
notifications.

00:06:42.376 --> 00:06:44.726 A:middle
Okay. No, now let's go over a

00:06:44.726 --> 00:06:46.996 A:middle
few examples from iOS 12.

00:06:48.136 --> 00:06:49.816 A:middle
The most important thing to keep

00:06:49.816 --> 00:06:51.326 A:middle
in mind as we go through these

00:06:51.326 --> 00:06:53.276 A:middle
examples is the goal on

00:06:53.276 --> 00:06:54.266 A:middle
notification grouping.

00:06:55.076 --> 00:06:56.226 A:middle
When grouping-- by grouping

00:06:56.226 --> 00:06:59.276 A:middle
notifications we want to make

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.186 A:middle
notifications more efficient for


00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.186 A:middle
notifications more efficient for

00:07:01.186 --> 00:07:01.696 A:middle
the user.

00:07:01.886 --> 00:07:03.956 A:middle
And improve the organization in

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:04.936 A:middle
Notification Center.

00:07:05.376 --> 00:07:06.496 A:middle
I'm sure you're familiar with

00:07:06.496 --> 00:07:09.386 A:middle
the situation where one app has

00:07:09.386 --> 00:07:10.716 A:middle
sent many notifications.

00:07:10.716 --> 00:07:12.286 A:middle
Maybe you're in a chatty,

00:07:12.926 --> 00:07:14.176 A:middle
messages conversations and

00:07:14.176 --> 00:07:15.456 A:middle
someone is sending a lot of

00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:16.066 A:middle
messages.

00:07:16.756 --> 00:07:17.926 A:middle
We want to improve that

00:07:17.926 --> 00:07:19.966 A:middle
situation by organizing

00:07:19.966 --> 00:07:21.136 A:middle
notifications a little bit

00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:23.076 A:middle
better so that the user can use

00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:23.976 A:middle
them more effectively.

00:07:28.466 --> 00:07:30.246 A:middle
Our first example is Calendar.

00:07:32.936 --> 00:07:35.456 A:middle
Depending on how you organize

00:07:35.456 --> 00:07:37.006 A:middle
your life or where you work,

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:39.016 A:middle
Calendar may send you a lot of

00:07:39.016 --> 00:07:41.886 A:middle
notifications for event changes,

00:07:41.886 --> 00:07:42.796 A:middle
event invites.

00:07:44.036 --> 00:07:45.816 A:middle
But not all of them have the

00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:46.806 A:middle
same importance.

00:07:47.076 --> 00:07:48.356 A:middle
There are some notifications

00:07:48.356 --> 00:07:49.676 A:middle
that are sent by Calendar that

00:07:49.676 --> 00:07:52.576 A:middle
are more important than others.

00:07:53.086 --> 00:07:56.436 A:middle
And they are event alerts that

00:07:56.436 --> 00:07:57.596 A:middle
you set up when you create an

00:07:57.596 --> 00:07:57.916 A:middle
event.

00:07:58.576 --> 00:08:00.316 A:middle
Or time to leave notifications.


00:07:58.576 --> 00:08:00.316 A:middle
Or time to leave notifications.

00:08:00.656 --> 00:08:02.346 A:middle
These are more important because

00:08:02.666 --> 00:08:04.546 A:middle
are notifications that I need to

00:08:04.546 --> 00:08:05.546 A:middle
act on right now.

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:07.116 A:middle
If I receive a notification that

00:08:07.116 --> 00:08:08.736 A:middle
I have a meeting in 15 minutes,

00:08:09.086 --> 00:08:10.536 A:middle
I need to start walking, because

00:08:10.536 --> 00:08:11.446 A:middle
I have to go to the meeting.

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:13.896 A:middle
But many of the other

00:08:13.896 --> 00:08:15.436 A:middle
notifications are not something

00:08:15.436 --> 00:08:18.006 A:middle
that need to be responded to

00:08:18.006 --> 00:08:18.526 A:middle
immediately.

00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:20.986 A:middle
There may be updates to share

00:08:20.986 --> 00:08:21.696 A:middle
Calendars.

00:08:22.176 --> 00:08:23.986 A:middle
There may be time changes in

00:08:23.986 --> 00:08:25.576 A:middle
other events that are later in

00:08:25.576 --> 00:08:27.096 A:middle
the day or some other day.

00:08:27.996 --> 00:08:29.956 A:middle
And so it's useful to separate

00:08:29.956 --> 00:08:30.246 A:middle
them.

00:08:31.796 --> 00:08:33.466 A:middle
So what Calendar is doing is

00:08:33.976 --> 00:08:35.996 A:middle
using the default group, the app

00:08:36.076 --> 00:08:38.566 A:middle
group, for the bulk of the

00:08:38.566 --> 00:08:39.716 A:middle
notification that it sends.

00:08:39.905 --> 00:08:41.905 A:middle
And it does that by not setting

00:08:41.905 --> 00:08:43.686 A:middle
any thread identifier on a

00:08:43.686 --> 00:08:45.396 A:middle
majority of its notifications.

00:08:46.066 --> 00:08:47.556 A:middle
Mail is a default value.

00:08:47.696 --> 00:08:49.486 A:middle
So if you don't set it, that's a

00:08:49.486 --> 00:08:51.426 A:middle
default group.

00:08:51.576 --> 00:08:54.076 A:middle
And then Calendar sets a

00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:56.026 A:middle
specific thread identifier just

00:08:56.026 --> 00:08:57.936 A:middle
for these notifications that are

00:08:57.936 --> 00:08:59.396 A:middle
more important and that it wants

00:08:59.396 --> 00:09:00.546 A:middle
to call out.


00:08:59.396 --> 00:09:00.546 A:middle
to call out.

00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:06.776 A:middle
So the result is that most of

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:08.866 A:middle
the notifications from Calendar

00:09:08.866 --> 00:09:11.516 A:middle
that are information updates

00:09:12.036 --> 00:09:14.186 A:middle
that are not something that I

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:15.406 A:middle
need to react to immediately.

00:09:15.716 --> 00:09:17.506 A:middle
Or that I don't need to have in

00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:18.936 A:middle
reference later.

00:09:19.046 --> 00:09:20.126 A:middle
For example, to know where the

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:20.666 A:middle
event is.

00:09:21.086 --> 00:09:22.276 A:middle
They're grouped together in one

00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:22.796 A:middle
group.

00:09:23.876 --> 00:09:25.476 A:middle
And the other notifications that

00:09:25.536 --> 00:09:26.626 A:middle
are the more important ones,

00:09:26.626 --> 00:09:28.316 A:middle
more urgent or the ones that I

00:09:28.316 --> 00:09:29.856 A:middle
need to reference maybe later to

00:09:29.856 --> 00:09:32.066 A:middle
find the meeting room, they're

00:09:32.066 --> 00:09:36.866 A:middle
separate than this other one.

00:09:37.056 --> 00:09:40.436 A:middle
So this is-- just expand and I

00:09:40.436 --> 00:09:42.596 A:middle
see what else is in my group.

00:09:43.286 --> 00:09:47.606 A:middle
And this is the pattern that we

00:09:47.606 --> 00:09:48.606 A:middle
learned from Calendar.

00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:51.066 A:middle
Separate important actional

00:09:51.066 --> 00:09:52.796 A:middle
notification from informative

00:09:52.796 --> 00:09:53.346 A:middle
updates.

00:09:58.496 --> 00:10:01.256 A:middle
Our next example is Messages.


00:09:58.496 --> 00:10:01.256 A:middle
Our next example is Messages.

00:10:02.796 --> 00:10:04.776 A:middle
Messages is maybe the most

00:10:04.776 --> 00:10:06.676 A:middle
straightforward notification

00:10:06.676 --> 00:10:07.706 A:middle
group's implementation.

00:10:08.486 --> 00:10:09.936 A:middle
It's pretty obvious.

00:10:09.936 --> 00:10:11.566 A:middle
Messages has conversations.

00:10:12.256 --> 00:10:13.866 A:middle
And each conversation has its

00:10:13.866 --> 00:10:14.846 A:middle
own group.

00:10:16.146 --> 00:10:17.886 A:middle
But we still, we can still learn

00:10:17.886 --> 00:10:18.716 A:middle
something important.

00:10:18.716 --> 00:10:20.446 A:middle
We can still learn a good lesson

00:10:20.446 --> 00:10:21.276 A:middle
from Messages.

00:10:21.906 --> 00:10:24.866 A:middle
Why is it that Messages separate

00:10:25.016 --> 00:10:26.706 A:middle
all these groups in different

00:10:26.706 --> 00:10:27.936 A:middle
conv-- different conversation in

00:10:27.936 --> 00:10:28.626 A:middle
different groups?

00:10:28.996 --> 00:10:31.116 A:middle
Well notifications that Messages

00:10:31.116 --> 00:10:34.386 A:middle
sends are generally from people.

00:10:34.436 --> 00:10:35.496 A:middle
From your friends, from your

00:10:35.496 --> 00:10:35.926 A:middle
family.

00:10:36.216 --> 00:10:37.406 A:middle
They're notifications that we

00:10:37.406 --> 00:10:39.526 A:middle
care about, that are important.

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:42.476 A:middle
And second they're notifications

00:10:42.476 --> 00:10:44.006 A:middle
that usually are short-lived.

00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:45.636 A:middle
Because usually you respond

00:10:45.636 --> 00:10:46.786 A:middle
pretty quickly at a Message.

00:10:47.126 --> 00:10:48.596 A:middle
And it will go away from

00:10:48.596 --> 00:10:50.116 A:middle
Notifications Center.

00:10:51.596 --> 00:10:53.746 A:middle
So what Messages does is it

00:10:53.746 --> 00:10:56.036 A:middle
creates a thread for these

00:10:56.576 --> 00:10:57.946 A:middle
one-to-one conversation.

00:10:57.946 --> 00:10:59.546 A:middle
And it creates a separate

00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:02.106 A:middle
notification group for these


00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:02.106 A:middle
notification group for these

00:11:02.106 --> 00:11:02.956 A:middle
group conversation.

00:11:03.756 --> 00:11:06.636 A:middle
Just generates any group

00:11:06.636 --> 00:11:08.606 A:middle
identifier for that thread and

00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:09.566 A:middle
they get grouped together.

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:16.076 A:middle
It can expand and see, still see

00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:17.036 A:middle
all my messages.

00:11:18.396 --> 00:11:20.316 A:middle
So what does-- what is the

00:11:20.316 --> 00:11:21.386 A:middle
lesson that we learned from

00:11:21.386 --> 00:11:22.016 A:middle
Messages?

00:11:22.676 --> 00:11:24.456 A:middle
Create groups for meaningful,

00:11:24.586 --> 00:11:25.816 A:middle
personal communications.

00:11:26.626 --> 00:11:27.576 A:middle
These notifications from

00:11:27.576 --> 00:11:30.226 A:middle
Messages are usually important.

00:11:30.616 --> 00:11:33.856 A:middle
And they live very shortly in

00:11:33.856 --> 00:11:34.766 A:middle
Notification Center.

00:11:34.766 --> 00:11:37.146 A:middle
So we can create many separate

00:11:37.146 --> 00:11:38.716 A:middle
groups for all of them.

00:11:42.896 --> 00:11:44.756 A:middle
Our final example is Mail.

00:11:47.046 --> 00:11:49.376 A:middle
And Mail shares some of the same

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:51.056 A:middle
characteristics that Messages

00:11:51.056 --> 00:11:51.476 A:middle
has.

00:11:52.236 --> 00:11:54.586 A:middle
So they're often direct

00:11:54.586 --> 00:11:55.896 A:middle
communications with people.

00:11:56.626 --> 00:12:01.376 A:middle
They have a same, a similar


00:11:56.626 --> 00:12:01.376 A:middle
They have a same, a similar

00:12:01.376 --> 00:12:03.626 A:middle
concept of threads.

00:12:03.626 --> 00:12:04.486 A:middle
Conversations.

00:12:05.856 --> 00:12:07.476 A:middle
But there is some major

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:09.326 A:middle
differences between Mail and

00:12:09.326 --> 00:12:09.736 A:middle
Messages.

00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:12.706 A:middle
Mail can have an even higher

00:12:12.706 --> 00:12:14.406 A:middle
volume of notifications than

00:12:14.406 --> 00:12:15.056 A:middle
messages.

00:12:15.746 --> 00:12:18.556 A:middle
And on the other hand, they can

00:12:18.556 --> 00:12:20.076 A:middle
also be more long-lived.

00:12:20.896 --> 00:12:24.816 A:middle
Mail, email is usually used for

00:12:25.116 --> 00:12:26.326 A:middle
slower communications.

00:12:26.326 --> 00:12:27.836 A:middle
Something that I don't expect to

00:12:27.836 --> 00:12:29.336 A:middle
respond to immediately.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:33.236 A:middle
And so organizing Mail threads,

00:12:33.816 --> 00:12:36.296 A:middle
organizing Mail notifications by

00:12:36.296 --> 00:12:38.136 A:middle
thread will not be ideal.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:40.506 A:middle
It will create a lot of threads

00:12:40.646 --> 00:12:41.846 A:middle
in Notification Center.

00:12:42.266 --> 00:12:44.486 A:middle
And the UI to see in those

00:12:44.486 --> 00:12:46.306 A:middle
thread is not very efficient.

00:12:46.306 --> 00:12:47.936 A:middle
Mail provides a specific

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.916 A:middle
dedicated UI to displaying mail

00:12:50.916 --> 00:12:51.136 A:middle
threads.

00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:54.836 A:middle
So how is Mail organizing its

00:12:54.836 --> 00:12:55.676 A:middle
notifications?

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.566 A:middle
Well, first of all, Mail

00:12:58.726 --> 00:13:01.186 A:middle
provides some features to


00:12:58.726 --> 00:13:01.186 A:middle
provides some features to

00:13:01.186 --> 00:13:03.186 A:middle
already organize and prioritize

00:13:03.286 --> 00:13:04.876 A:middle
the emails that arrive in your

00:13:04.876 --> 00:13:05.336 A:middle
inbox.

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:09.226 A:middle
Mail provides separate accounts.

00:13:09.226 --> 00:13:10.296 A:middle
You can have many different

00:13:10.296 --> 00:13:12.116 A:middle
accounts set up in your device.

00:13:13.116 --> 00:13:15.046 A:middle
Provides VIP.

00:13:15.046 --> 00:13:17.556 A:middle
You can set any contact as VIP.

00:13:17.556 --> 00:13:20.596 A:middle
You can create-- you can have

00:13:20.696 --> 00:13:21.666 A:middle
favorite folders.

00:13:22.066 --> 00:13:23.326 A:middle
And you can turn on

00:13:23.326 --> 00:13:24.696 A:middle
notifications for specific

00:13:24.766 --> 00:13:27.746 A:middle
threads inside your mail client.

00:13:28.596 --> 00:13:31.116 A:middle
And so it seems like the user is

00:13:31.116 --> 00:13:33.156 A:middle
already telling us which

00:13:33.156 --> 00:13:34.026 A:middle
notifications are more

00:13:34.026 --> 00:13:34.566 A:middle
important.

00:13:34.566 --> 00:13:35.746 A:middle
Which email messages are more

00:13:35.746 --> 00:13:37.036 A:middle
important and which are less

00:13:37.036 --> 00:13:37.616 A:middle
important.

00:13:37.926 --> 00:13:39.156 A:middle
And that is what Mail does.

00:13:39.836 --> 00:13:43.116 A:middle
Mail organizes notifications

00:13:43.276 --> 00:13:44.766 A:middle
first by starting with the

00:13:44.966 --> 00:13:45.896 A:middle
account group.

00:13:46.436 --> 00:13:48.186 A:middle
It creates one big account for

00:13:48.236 --> 00:13:49.926 A:middle
all the emails that arrive in a

00:13:49.926 --> 00:13:50.776 A:middle
specific account.

00:13:51.786 --> 00:13:53.546 A:middle
If I had multiple accounts, each

00:13:53.546 --> 00:13:55.566 A:middle
one would get its own group.

00:13:56.316 --> 00:14:00.016 A:middle
But then if a contact that is in


00:13:56.316 --> 00:14:00.016 A:middle
But then if a contact that is in

00:14:00.016 --> 00:14:02.296 A:middle
my VIP contact sends an email to

00:14:02.296 --> 00:14:03.016 A:middle
that account.

00:14:03.796 --> 00:14:06.286 A:middle
That email is separated out to a

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.536 A:middle
different group because I said

00:14:08.536 --> 00:14:09.706 A:middle
that's a VIP person.

00:14:09.706 --> 00:14:11.016 A:middle
That's a contract that I want to

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:13.836 A:middle
be informed about immediately

00:14:13.916 --> 00:14:16.616 A:middle
when it sends an email.

00:14:16.616 --> 00:14:18.226 A:middle
And if I turn on thread

00:14:18.226 --> 00:14:19.826 A:middle
notifications for some specific

00:14:19.876 --> 00:14:22.256 A:middle
threads inside of Mail, also,

00:14:22.256 --> 00:14:24.256 A:middle
those also get separated out in

00:14:24.346 --> 00:14:24.976 A:middle
their own group.

00:14:29.266 --> 00:14:32.166 A:middle
So you see that while Mail

00:14:32.466 --> 00:14:34.636 A:middle
shares some of the same

00:14:34.636 --> 00:14:37.356 A:middle
characteristics as Messages, the

00:14:37.356 --> 00:14:38.266 A:middle
approach of grouping

00:14:38.266 --> 00:14:39.416 A:middle
notification is a little

00:14:39.416 --> 00:14:39.876 A:middle
different.

00:14:39.936 --> 00:14:41.656 A:middle
Because the use of the

00:14:41.656 --> 00:14:43.336 A:middle
notification and of the app and

00:14:43.336 --> 00:14:45.266 A:middle
the content is different.

00:14:46.216 --> 00:14:49.036 A:middle
So what is Mail telling us here?

00:14:49.776 --> 00:14:51.726 A:middle
Respect the user's priorities

00:14:51.776 --> 00:14:52.746 A:middle
and organization.

00:14:53.116 --> 00:14:54.796 A:middle
Mail provides feature to

00:14:54.796 --> 00:14:57.306 A:middle
organize email and to prioritize

00:14:57.306 --> 00:14:57.966 A:middle
the content.

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:00.926 A:middle
So we can use that to organize


00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:00.926 A:middle
So we can use that to organize

00:15:00.926 --> 00:15:01.976 A:middle
notifications that Mail sends.

00:15:10.246 --> 00:15:12.196 A:middle
So now that we've seen how to

00:15:12.196 --> 00:15:14.566 A:middle
create as many groups as we

00:15:14.566 --> 00:15:18.776 A:middle
want, we'll see how to make

00:15:18.776 --> 00:15:20.146 A:middle
these groups a little bit more

00:15:20.146 --> 00:15:20.656 A:middle
clear.

00:15:20.656 --> 00:15:22.106 A:middle
By providing some bits of

00:15:22.106 --> 00:15:23.926 A:middle
information in the group.

00:15:25.186 --> 00:15:27.576 A:middle
That describes the content that

00:15:27.576 --> 00:15:28.136 A:middle
they contain.

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:33.216 A:middle
As we see in these example of my

00:15:33.216 --> 00:15:34.576 A:middle
Notification Center from last

00:15:34.576 --> 00:15:34.726 A:middle
week.

00:15:35.686 --> 00:15:37.446 A:middle
Each group has a little short

00:15:37.446 --> 00:15:38.486 A:middle
summary at the bottom.

00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:39.936 A:middle
And it explains a little bit of

00:15:39.936 --> 00:15:41.076 A:middle
what that group is about.

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.136 A:middle
For example, you see Mail says

00:15:43.136 --> 00:15:45.136 A:middle
that I have a few emails from in

00:15:45.136 --> 00:15:46.076 A:middle
my work account.

00:15:47.466 --> 00:15:49.116 A:middle
Podcasts is telling me that I

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:50.456 A:middle
have a bunch of new episodes

00:15:50.496 --> 00:15:52.186 A:middle
that were delivered to my

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:56.496 A:middle
Podcasts app to listen.

00:15:56.556 --> 00:15:59.166 A:middle
And News tells me I have nine

00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:00.726 A:middle
more notifications from National


00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:00.726 A:middle
more notifications from National

00:16:00.726 --> 00:16:01.746 A:middle
Geographic.

00:16:05.186 --> 00:16:07.356 A:middle
Let's explore this one a little

00:16:07.356 --> 00:16:07.616 A:middle
bit.

00:16:07.656 --> 00:16:10.426 A:middle
If your nine notifications said

00:16:10.426 --> 00:16:12.096 A:middle
default message that we set in

00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:13.796 A:middle
groups if you don't customize

00:16:13.796 --> 00:16:14.326 A:middle
your summary.

00:16:15.166 --> 00:16:18.856 A:middle
But you can better describe your

00:16:18.856 --> 00:16:19.366 A:middle
content.

00:16:19.416 --> 00:16:20.916 A:middle
For example, if you have an app

00:16:20.976 --> 00:16:22.176 A:middle
that sends messages.

00:16:22.966 --> 00:16:24.856 A:middle
You may want to see, you may

00:16:24.856 --> 00:16:26.056 A:middle
want to say there that you're

00:16:26.056 --> 00:16:27.306 A:middle
sending nine more messages.

00:16:28.156 --> 00:16:30.006 A:middle
So how you do that?

00:16:30.776 --> 00:16:32.206 A:middle
The first thing you have to do

00:16:32.236 --> 00:16:34.186 A:middle
is to pick a summary format.

00:16:34.446 --> 00:16:36.316 A:middle
And this is a format string that

00:16:36.316 --> 00:16:37.906 A:middle
just describes your content with

00:16:37.906 --> 00:16:39.356 A:middle
a numerical placeholder.

00:16:39.636 --> 00:16:41.926 A:middle
As we see here, number, more

00:16:41.926 --> 00:16:42.646 A:middle
messages.

00:16:42.956 --> 00:16:45.876 A:middle
And then you set this format

00:16:45.876 --> 00:16:47.566 A:middle
string in the notification

00:16:47.566 --> 00:16:49.776 A:middle
category that you're going to

00:16:49.776 --> 00:16:50.926 A:middle
use to send a notification.

00:16:54.276 --> 00:16:55.586 A:middle
If you notice, the summary

00:16:55.586 --> 00:16:57.386 A:middle
format is set on the category.

00:16:57.806 --> 00:16:59.356 A:middle
Whereas the thread was set on

00:16:59.356 --> 00:17:00.546 A:middle
the notification content.


00:16:59.356 --> 00:17:00.546 A:middle
the notification content.

00:17:01.076 --> 00:17:02.796 A:middle
This is because categories as

00:17:02.796 --> 00:17:06.266 A:middle
you know are types, groups, of

00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:08.626 A:middle
notifications that you send that

00:17:08.626 --> 00:17:09.326 A:middle
are similar.

00:17:09.955 --> 00:17:11.596 A:middle
For example, messages has

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:12.935 A:middle
different categories for

00:17:13.336 --> 00:17:14.945 A:middle
one-to-one conversations.

00:17:15.026 --> 00:17:16.675 A:middle
And group conversations.

00:17:17.046 --> 00:17:18.266 A:middle
And this means that they can set

00:17:18.266 --> 00:17:19.806 A:middle
different summaries for those

00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:20.616 A:middle
two categories.

00:17:21.106 --> 00:17:22.326 A:middle
That is why the summary format

00:17:22.326 --> 00:17:23.766 A:middle
is set in the category here.

00:17:27.435 --> 00:17:29.546 A:middle
And while you're here updating

00:17:29.546 --> 00:17:31.166 A:middle
your notification category for

00:17:31.526 --> 00:17:33.306 A:middle
notification groups, you can

00:17:33.306 --> 00:17:35.536 A:middle
also set this hidden previous

00:17:35.536 --> 00:17:38.216 A:middle
placeholder property which is

00:17:38.216 --> 00:17:40.346 A:middle
very similar to the summary that

00:17:40.346 --> 00:17:41.816 A:middle
we used for notification groups.

00:17:42.656 --> 00:17:43.936 A:middle
The major difference between

00:17:43.936 --> 00:17:45.916 A:middle
these two is the context in

00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:46.656 A:middle
which they're used.

00:17:47.586 --> 00:17:48.906 A:middle
The hidden previous placeholder

00:17:48.906 --> 00:17:49.866 A:middle
is not a new feature.

00:17:49.866 --> 00:17:50.726 A:middle
It's a feature that we

00:17:50.726 --> 00:17:52.906 A:middle
introduced last year in iOS 11.

00:17:53.696 --> 00:17:56.486 A:middle
And this customizes the text

00:17:56.816 --> 00:17:58.736 A:middle
that is displayed instead of the

00:17:58.736 --> 00:18:00.566 A:middle
notification when the user sets


00:17:58.736 --> 00:18:00.566 A:middle
notification when the user sets

00:18:00.566 --> 00:18:02.066 A:middle
the notification to be private.

00:18:02.876 --> 00:18:03.916 A:middle
If I set a notification to be

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:07.066 A:middle
private, I say nine more

00:18:07.066 --> 00:18:07.776 A:middle
messages.

00:18:08.286 --> 00:18:09.926 A:middle
But then when I authenticate and

00:18:09.926 --> 00:18:12.156 A:middle
I unlock my device, I can see

00:18:12.306 --> 00:18:13.696 A:middle
the expanding notification and

00:18:13.696 --> 00:18:15.536 A:middle
the summary underneath that says

00:18:16.006 --> 00:18:17.066 A:middle
eight more messages.

00:18:17.476 --> 00:18:19.486 A:middle
And that is why the summary

00:18:19.486 --> 00:18:21.646 A:middle
format has more messages.

00:18:22.066 --> 00:18:23.726 A:middle
And the preview placeholder has

00:18:23.726 --> 00:18:25.806 A:middle
only the number of messages.

00:18:31.196 --> 00:18:34.436 A:middle
So that was the setup for a

00:18:34.436 --> 00:18:36.166 A:middle
basic summary.

00:18:36.826 --> 00:18:38.486 A:middle
But Messages for group

00:18:38.486 --> 00:18:39.776 A:middle
conversation has a more

00:18:39.776 --> 00:18:41.816 A:middle
interesting summary, where it

00:18:41.816 --> 00:18:43.416 A:middle
says the number of messages.

00:18:43.696 --> 00:18:46.096 A:middle
But also the people that sent

00:18:46.096 --> 00:18:48.926 A:middle
those messages in that thread in

00:18:48.926 --> 00:18:49.736 A:middle
that conversation.

00:18:49.736 --> 00:18:52.676 A:middle
And we cannot do that with the

00:18:52.676 --> 00:18:54.056 A:middle
formula that we just specified

00:18:54.056 --> 00:18:55.916 A:middle
because it only has a numerical

00:18:55.916 --> 00:18:56.586 A:middle
placeholder.

00:18:57.656 --> 00:19:00.476 A:middle
So what we do is we create a


00:18:57.656 --> 00:19:00.476 A:middle
So what we do is we create a

00:19:00.476 --> 00:19:02.736 A:middle
different summary format that

00:19:02.736 --> 00:19:06.206 A:middle
contains a numerical string-- a

00:19:06.206 --> 00:19:07.986 A:middle
numerical placeholder and a

00:19:07.986 --> 00:19:08.966 A:middle
string placeholder.

00:19:09.286 --> 00:19:11.196 A:middle
As you see here, number, more

00:19:11.196 --> 00:19:13.176 A:middle
messages from a string.

00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:15.926 A:middle
And we will replace the second

00:19:15.926 --> 00:19:17.486 A:middle
placeholder with a list of names

00:19:17.876 --> 00:19:19.246 A:middle
that are in the notifications.

00:19:20.856 --> 00:19:22.736 A:middle
Still set the summary format in

00:19:22.736 --> 00:19:23.376 A:middle
the category.

00:19:24.126 --> 00:19:25.936 A:middle
And then we have to collect

00:19:25.936 --> 00:19:26.636 A:middle
these names.

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.306 A:middle
To send these names, you set

00:19:30.366 --> 00:19:33.076 A:middle
them in the notification content

00:19:33.136 --> 00:19:33.566 A:middle
again.

00:19:33.706 --> 00:19:35.216 A:middle
Because each notification can be

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.716 A:middle
sent by a different person.

00:19:36.716 --> 00:19:40.396 A:middle
And they can be different names.

00:19:40.576 --> 00:19:42.466 A:middle
So we will collect all of those

00:19:42.466 --> 00:19:44.976 A:middle
names, build them up in a string

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:48.726 A:middle
and replace them in the summary.

00:19:49.046 --> 00:19:50.956 A:middle
Oh, this is the push payload of

00:19:51.006 --> 00:19:52.786 A:middle
course also supports summary

00:19:52.786 --> 00:19:53.356 A:middle
arguments.

00:19:53.866 --> 00:19:56.226 A:middle
And this is how the summary

00:19:56.396 --> 00:19:58.496 A:middle
looks after we collected all the

00:19:58.496 --> 00:20:00.306 A:middle
names and formatted them in the


00:19:58.496 --> 00:20:00.306 A:middle
names and formatted them in the

00:20:00.306 --> 00:20:00.966 A:middle
summary argument.

00:20:06.096 --> 00:20:07.546 A:middle
The names don't need to be

00:20:07.546 --> 00:20:07.996 A:middle
unique.

00:20:08.186 --> 00:20:11.166 A:middle
You can send many notifications

00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:12.006 A:middle
with the same name.

00:20:12.526 --> 00:20:15.506 A:middle
And in this, in the Mail case,

00:20:15.506 --> 00:20:16.896 A:middle
for example, all the

00:20:16.896 --> 00:20:18.396 A:middle
notifications have the same name

00:20:18.396 --> 00:20:19.386 A:middle
because they're all in the same

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:19.856 A:middle
account.

00:20:20.176 --> 00:20:22.256 A:middle
We will handle de-duplicating

00:20:22.256 --> 00:20:23.716 A:middle
them and will display only one

00:20:23.866 --> 00:20:25.796 A:middle
instance for each single name

00:20:25.796 --> 00:20:26.566 A:middle
that is visible.

00:20:32.016 --> 00:20:34.766 A:middle
Next example is Podcasts.

00:20:35.396 --> 00:20:37.566 A:middle
Podcasts shows us another small

00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:40.226 A:middle
detail about this API.

00:20:40.346 --> 00:20:41.396 A:middle
What is special about this

00:20:41.396 --> 00:20:42.116 A:middle
notification?

00:20:42.956 --> 00:20:44.426 A:middle
In this notification, Podcasts

00:20:44.426 --> 00:20:46.426 A:middle
is saying that there are two new

00:20:46.426 --> 00:20:49.506 A:middle
episodes available in my leading

00:20:49.506 --> 00:20:51.816 A:middle
notification Podcasts.

00:20:53.276 --> 00:20:54.776 A:middle
And the summary says that there

00:20:54.776 --> 00:20:56.966 A:middle
are seven more episodes from a

00:20:56.966 --> 00:20:57.746 A:middle
number of shows.

00:20:58.656 --> 00:21:00.326 A:middle
And what happens when I expand


00:20:58.656 --> 00:21:00.326 A:middle
And what happens when I expand

00:21:00.326 --> 00:21:01.126 A:middle
this group?

00:21:03.276 --> 00:21:04.906 A:middle
What happens is that there are

00:21:04.906 --> 00:21:05.976 A:middle
only three external

00:21:05.976 --> 00:21:07.366 A:middle
notifications in the group.

00:21:07.826 --> 00:21:10.106 A:middle
Not seven like the summary said.

00:21:10.366 --> 00:21:11.796 A:middle
And in previous examples, the

00:21:11.796 --> 00:21:13.816 A:middle
number in the summary matched

00:21:14.076 --> 00:21:15.886 A:middle
the number of notifications that

00:21:15.886 --> 00:21:18.206 A:middle
were contained in the group.

00:21:18.396 --> 00:21:19.556 A:middle
So what is happening here?

00:21:20.936 --> 00:21:23.386 A:middle
Well, since Podcasts does these

00:21:23.386 --> 00:21:25.176 A:middle
bundling on notification and

00:21:25.176 --> 00:21:26.886 A:middle
they try to limit the number of

00:21:26.886 --> 00:21:28.196 A:middle
notifications they send.

00:21:28.716 --> 00:21:30.706 A:middle
When a show releases multiple

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:32.106 A:middle
episodes at the same time.

00:21:32.576 --> 00:21:33.716 A:middle
They have these notifications

00:21:33.716 --> 00:21:35.566 A:middle
that say, "Two new episodes are

00:21:35.566 --> 00:21:36.796 A:middle
available, three new episodes

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:37.246 A:middle
are available."

00:21:38.286 --> 00:21:41.426 A:middle
And if you sum the number, the

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:42.866 A:middle
number of episodes in the bottom

00:21:42.866 --> 00:21:44.146 A:middle
three notifications, there were

00:21:44.466 --> 00:21:45.696 A:middle
the ones that accounted for the

00:21:45.696 --> 00:21:47.006 A:middle
summary, you can see that the

00:21:47.006 --> 00:21:47.846 A:middle
total is seven.

00:21:48.966 --> 00:21:51.106 A:middle
So let's see how the API for

00:21:51.106 --> 00:21:51.786 A:middle
this works.

00:21:52.376 --> 00:21:55.146 A:middle
It's just another property on

00:21:55.146 --> 00:21:56.796 A:middle
the notification content and

00:21:56.796 --> 00:21:58.246 A:middle
it's called summary argument

00:21:58.296 --> 00:21:58.656 A:middle
count.


00:22:00.066 --> 00:22:01.856 A:middle
And this count expresses the

00:22:01.856 --> 00:22:03.986 A:middle
number of items that summary

00:22:03.986 --> 00:22:05.666 A:middle
argument account, accounts for.

00:22:05.986 --> 00:22:06.706 A:middle
In the summary.

00:22:07.256 --> 00:22:10.516 A:middle
We will collect again as before

00:22:10.516 --> 00:22:11.236 A:middle
all the names.

00:22:11.806 --> 00:22:13.786 A:middle
We will sum up all the counts.

00:22:14.006 --> 00:22:16.036 A:middle
And we will create the summary.

00:22:16.996 --> 00:22:19.466 A:middle
And again as we can see, these

00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:21.556 A:middle
notification would have summary

00:22:21.556 --> 00:22:23.386 A:middle
argument count three, one,

00:22:23.496 --> 00:22:25.056 A:middle
three, total is seven.

00:22:25.776 --> 00:22:27.516 A:middle
And that's the summary that we

00:22:27.516 --> 00:22:27.946 A:middle
displayed.

00:22:28.386 --> 00:22:31.916 A:middle
And as everything else, of

00:22:31.916 --> 00:22:33.356 A:middle
course you can also set it in

00:22:33.356 --> 00:22:34.136 A:middle
the push payload.

00:22:37.916 --> 00:22:39.636 A:middle
The summary argument count is

00:22:39.636 --> 00:22:40.096 A:middle
optional.

00:22:40.646 --> 00:22:42.776 A:middle
Defaults to one so you can only

00:22:42.776 --> 00:22:44.866 A:middle
need to set it if you're doing

00:22:44.866 --> 00:22:45.996 A:middle
this type of bundling on

00:22:45.996 --> 00:22:46.686 A:middle
notifications.

00:22:46.686 --> 00:22:47.706 A:middle
You don't need to set it always.

00:22:54.086 --> 00:22:57.236 A:middle
Now, we are playing with words

00:22:57.506 --> 00:22:59.346 A:middle
and we are building sentences.

00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:01.936 A:middle
And when you do that, you always


00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:01.936 A:middle
And when you do that, you always

00:23:01.936 --> 00:23:04.606 A:middle
need to account for different

00:23:04.606 --> 00:23:06.256 A:middle
languages and you need to

00:23:06.256 --> 00:23:07.646 A:middle
account for plurals in this

00:23:07.646 --> 00:23:07.966 A:middle
case.

00:23:07.966 --> 00:23:09.036 A:middle
Because we have numbers.

00:23:11.816 --> 00:23:13.756 A:middle
Again, another Podcast

00:23:13.756 --> 00:23:14.376 A:middle
notification.

00:23:14.376 --> 00:23:15.536 A:middle
For example, in this case.

00:23:15.846 --> 00:23:17.206 A:middle
It says, "Four more episodes."

00:23:17.906 --> 00:23:19.576 A:middle
But if I only had one more

00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:21.796 A:middle
episode, that string would need

00:23:21.796 --> 00:23:22.496 A:middle
to be different.

00:23:23.266 --> 00:23:24.996 A:middle
But the API only allows us to

00:23:24.996 --> 00:23:25.816 A:middle
set one string.

00:23:27.156 --> 00:23:29.536 A:middle
And now we need two.

00:23:29.786 --> 00:23:30.986 A:middle
You need two in English.

00:23:31.766 --> 00:23:33.826 A:middle
But if you want to start to

00:23:33.826 --> 00:23:36.826 A:middle
localize your app or if your

00:23:36.826 --> 00:23:38.316 A:middle
main language is not English,

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:39.496 A:middle
you're writing up for a

00:23:39.496 --> 00:23:40.386 A:middle
different language.

00:23:41.136 --> 00:23:43.156 A:middle
Some languages have different

00:23:43.156 --> 00:23:44.226 A:middle
rules for plurals.

00:23:44.556 --> 00:23:46.126 A:middle
They may not have two cases.

00:23:46.156 --> 00:23:47.006 A:middle
They may have three.

00:23:47.416 --> 00:23:49.156 A:middle
And they may have cases that

00:23:49.156 --> 00:23:50.116 A:middle
apply with different rules.

00:23:51.666 --> 00:23:54.766 A:middle
So iOS in the foundation

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.926 A:middle
frameworks provides support for

00:23:56.926 --> 00:23:57.986 A:middle
localizing these kind of

00:23:57.986 --> 00:23:58.446 A:middle
strings.

00:23:58.906 --> 00:24:00.546 A:middle
So you don't need to learn all


00:23:58.906 --> 00:24:00.546 A:middle
So you don't need to learn all

00:24:00.546 --> 00:24:01.196 A:middle
the rules.

00:24:01.196 --> 00:24:02.576 A:middle
And you don't need to know all

00:24:02.576 --> 00:24:03.596 A:middle
the languages that you're going

00:24:03.596 --> 00:24:04.696 A:middle
to translate your app to.

00:24:05.886 --> 00:24:08.576 A:middle
And it's very simple to adopt

00:24:08.576 --> 00:24:11.296 A:middle
and translate each string to

00:24:11.296 --> 00:24:12.696 A:middle
have the correct plural form.

00:24:18.376 --> 00:24:20.116 A:middle
The first thing that we need to

00:24:20.506 --> 00:24:24.776 A:middle
do to adopt this 'fix our

00:24:24.776 --> 00:24:26.826 A:middle
problem with plurals' is to

00:24:26.826 --> 00:24:28.876 A:middle
replace the literal string that

00:24:28.876 --> 00:24:30.656 A:middle
we use for the summary format,

00:24:31.026 --> 00:24:32.566 A:middle
with a localized string.

00:24:32.986 --> 00:24:36.256 A:middle
And remember here that you need

00:24:36.256 --> 00:24:38.066 A:middle
to use our special notification

00:24:38.106 --> 00:24:39.836 A:middle
API for localized strings,

00:24:40.596 --> 00:24:43.536 A:middle
because we need to store these

00:24:43.536 --> 00:24:44.946 A:middle
localized string and set it

00:24:44.946 --> 00:24:45.556 A:middle
aside.

00:24:46.146 --> 00:24:48.136 A:middle
Because in the case that the

00:24:48.136 --> 00:24:49.916 A:middle
language of the system changes

00:24:50.546 --> 00:24:51.056 A:middle
later.

00:24:51.366 --> 00:24:52.746 A:middle
If you send notifications, we

00:24:52.746 --> 00:24:53.846 A:middle
send them with the correct

00:24:53.846 --> 00:24:56.166 A:middle
localization after the system

00:24:56.166 --> 00:24:57.196 A:middle
localization change.

00:24:59.716 --> 00:25:01.906 A:middle
So after you set a localized


00:24:59.716 --> 00:25:01.906 A:middle
So after you set a localized

00:25:01.906 --> 00:25:03.426 A:middle
string here, you need to

00:25:03.426 --> 00:25:04.416 A:middle
localize the string.

00:25:05.606 --> 00:25:08.976 A:middle
And you localize the string in a

00:25:09.206 --> 00:25:10.766 A:middle
strings dict file.

00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:12.996 A:middle
A strings dict file is a

00:25:13.436 --> 00:25:14.646 A:middle
property list file that

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:18.036 A:middle
describes a performance string

00:25:18.236 --> 00:25:20.186 A:middle
and a configuration dictionary.

00:25:20.526 --> 00:25:21.956 A:middle
In the configuration dictionary

00:25:21.956 --> 00:25:23.526 A:middle
here at the bottom, you see the

00:25:23.526 --> 00:25:26.646 A:middle
two versions of the string for

00:25:26.646 --> 00:25:28.586 A:middle
singular and plural in English.

00:25:29.526 --> 00:25:31.396 A:middle
But as I said, all you need to

00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:33.046 A:middle
do to support other languages

00:25:33.046 --> 00:25:34.256 A:middle
and different pluralization

00:25:34.256 --> 00:25:37.296 A:middle
rules is change this stings dict

00:25:37.296 --> 00:25:37.666 A:middle
file.

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:38.796 A:middle
You create a new one.

00:25:38.956 --> 00:25:40.776 A:middle
And you see here Hebrew has

00:25:40.826 --> 00:25:42.356 A:middle
three different cases for

00:25:43.556 --> 00:25:44.096 A:middle
plurals.

00:25:44.696 --> 00:25:47.106 A:middle
And Russian has three different

00:25:47.106 --> 00:25:48.616 A:middle
ones and they're different from

00:25:48.616 --> 00:25:48.996 A:middle
Hebrew.

00:25:49.216 --> 00:25:51.336 A:middle
And you don't need to know which

00:25:51.336 --> 00:25:52.266 A:middle
one to use when.

00:25:52.716 --> 00:25:53.886 A:middle
If you use the foundation API

00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:54.656 A:middle
that we provide.

00:25:56.776 --> 00:25:59.666 A:middle
This is for the simple summary


00:26:00.276 --> 00:26:01.286 A:middle
format that we just saw.

00:26:02.106 --> 00:26:04.416 A:middle
But of course we can also format

00:26:05.866 --> 00:26:07.106 A:middle
summaries with arguments.

00:26:08.216 --> 00:26:11.866 A:middle
You see we define the format

00:26:11.866 --> 00:26:12.986 A:middle
string at the top.

00:26:13.486 --> 00:26:14.746 A:middle
We need to match the

00:26:14.746 --> 00:26:17.536 A:middle
configuration dictionary by key.

00:26:18.756 --> 00:26:20.396 A:middle
And underneath we specify the

00:26:20.396 --> 00:26:21.646 A:middle
two strings for the two

00:26:21.646 --> 00:26:22.456 A:middle
different versions.

00:26:23.496 --> 00:26:25.586 A:middle
With the numerical placeholder

00:26:26.026 --> 00:26:28.216 A:middle
and the placeholder for the list

00:26:28.606 --> 00:26:29.526 A:middle
that we're going to provide with

00:26:29.526 --> 00:26:29.786 A:middle
names.

00:26:35.126 --> 00:26:39.146 A:middle
So since we're exchanging these

00:26:39.146 --> 00:26:41.896 A:middle
format strings between apps and

00:26:42.006 --> 00:26:42.806 A:middle
the system.

00:26:43.256 --> 00:26:44.646 A:middle
These are effectively part of

00:26:44.646 --> 00:26:44.996 A:middle
the API.

00:26:45.736 --> 00:26:47.826 A:middle
So there's only a limited number

00:26:47.946 --> 00:26:50.236 A:middle
of formats that we can support.

00:26:51.346 --> 00:26:52.936 A:middle
And we need to agree on those.

00:26:53.676 --> 00:26:54.576 A:middle
And they are the ones that I

00:26:54.576 --> 00:26:55.436 A:middle
just showed you in these

00:26:55.436 --> 00:26:56.116 A:middle
examples.

00:26:56.866 --> 00:26:58.506 A:middle
The first format that you can

00:26:58.506 --> 00:26:59.996 A:middle
use is the one with one


00:27:00.186 --> 00:27:01.486 A:middle
numerical placeholder.

00:27:02.066 --> 00:27:03.136 A:middle
When you don't need the

00:27:03.136 --> 00:27:04.696 A:middle
arguments and you need to

00:27:04.696 --> 00:27:07.496 A:middle
specify an unsigned number.

00:27:09.206 --> 00:27:10.996 A:middle
And the second format that you

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:13.216 A:middle
need, you can use is the one

00:27:13.216 --> 00:27:14.686 A:middle
with the numerical placeholder

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:16.166 A:middle
and the string placeholder.

00:27:16.166 --> 00:27:19.196 A:middle
We will automatically detect

00:27:19.496 --> 00:27:20.966 A:middle
which string you are using and

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:21.976 A:middle
format them correctly.

00:27:27.426 --> 00:27:29.416 A:middle
Now we're all done with the

00:27:29.416 --> 00:27:31.636 A:middle
features of notification

00:27:31.636 --> 00:27:32.046 A:middle
grouping.

00:27:32.576 --> 00:27:34.376 A:middle
But before you leave, I want to

00:27:34.376 --> 00:27:35.786 A:middle
give you a couple more tips

00:27:36.396 --> 00:27:37.986 A:middle
about notification grouping and

00:27:37.986 --> 00:27:40.026 A:middle
these API that will help you

00:27:40.026 --> 00:27:42.766 A:middle
finish the last bit of polish in

00:27:42.766 --> 00:27:44.546 A:middle
your app.

00:27:45.436 --> 00:27:48.396 A:middle
The first step is about

00:27:48.396 --> 00:27:52.416 A:middle
combining different summaries.

00:27:52.616 --> 00:27:54.606 A:middle
Since we saw that you can set

00:27:54.656 --> 00:27:57.136 A:middle
different summaries in different

00:27:57.136 --> 00:27:57.786 A:middle
categories.

00:27:58.186 --> 00:28:00.816 A:middle
And the thread group are defined


00:27:58.186 --> 00:28:00.816 A:middle
And the thread group are defined

00:28:00.816 --> 00:28:02.136 A:middle
in the notification content.

00:28:02.526 --> 00:28:04.526 A:middle
That means that you can mix in

00:28:04.526 --> 00:28:06.826 A:middle
the same group notifications

00:28:06.826 --> 00:28:08.196 A:middle
that have different summaries.

00:28:08.696 --> 00:28:09.986 A:middle
And what happens when you do

00:28:09.986 --> 00:28:10.216 A:middle
that?

00:28:11.276 --> 00:28:12.946 A:middle
So there's two main cases.

00:28:13.756 --> 00:28:16.206 A:middle
If none of the summaries in that

00:28:16.206 --> 00:28:18.756 A:middle
group have any arguments, we'll

00:28:18.756 --> 00:28:21.166 A:middle
try to combine all the summaries

00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:22.726 A:middle
in the list and display them

00:28:22.726 --> 00:28:24.246 A:middle
like this.

00:28:24.516 --> 00:28:28.196 A:middle
But if any of the notification

00:28:28.196 --> 00:28:31.116 A:middle
summaries in that group have any

00:28:31.116 --> 00:28:32.966 A:middle
arguments, we're going to have

00:28:32.966 --> 00:28:34.246 A:middle
to fall back to the default

00:28:34.246 --> 00:28:34.776 A:middle
message.

00:28:40.276 --> 00:28:43.486 A:middle
The second tip is about enriched

00:28:43.486 --> 00:28:45.026 A:middle
notifications and groups.

00:28:46.436 --> 00:28:47.836 A:middle
So we introduced enriched

00:28:47.836 --> 00:28:49.836 A:middle
notifications a while ago in

00:28:49.966 --> 00:28:50.516 A:middle
iOS.

00:28:51.006 --> 00:28:52.976 A:middle
And they continued working in

00:28:53.116 --> 00:28:54.406 A:middle
with group notifications.

00:28:55.356 --> 00:28:58.166 A:middle
And when the user presses on a

00:28:58.166 --> 00:28:59.576 A:middle
group to see the enriched

00:28:59.576 --> 00:29:01.566 A:middle
notification that loads your


00:28:59.576 --> 00:29:01.566 A:middle
notification that loads your

00:29:01.566 --> 00:29:02.826 A:middle
content extension for that

00:29:02.926 --> 00:29:05.406 A:middle
group, what happens is that your

00:29:05.406 --> 00:29:07.756 A:middle
notification will be loaded with

00:29:08.126 --> 00:29:09.856 A:middle
the leading notification.

00:29:09.856 --> 00:29:11.096 A:middle
The one that is displayed at the

00:29:11.146 --> 00:29:13.186 A:middle
top, and you receive it in

00:29:13.186 --> 00:29:14.806 A:middle
notification using the usual

00:29:15.106 --> 00:29:16.496 A:middle
[inaudible] notification API.

00:29:21.046 --> 00:29:22.456 A:middle
Once the extension is loaded,

00:29:22.826 --> 00:29:24.536 A:middle
you can load additional

00:29:24.536 --> 00:29:25.516 A:middle
notifications.

00:29:25.516 --> 00:29:26.716 A:middle
For example, the same ones that

00:29:26.716 --> 00:29:29.096 A:middle
are in the group or if you want

00:29:29.096 --> 00:29:30.196 A:middle
to display different content,

00:29:30.196 --> 00:29:31.266 A:middle
you can also load it with your

00:29:31.266 --> 00:29:31.656 A:middle
own API.

00:29:35.216 --> 00:29:37.546 A:middle
Then while your extension is

00:29:37.546 --> 00:29:39.286 A:middle
open and is running, if

00:29:39.286 --> 00:29:40.806 A:middle
additional notifications are

00:29:40.806 --> 00:29:42.596 A:middle
delivered to the same group, so

00:29:42.596 --> 00:29:43.566 A:middle
they have the same thread

00:29:43.566 --> 00:29:45.316 A:middle
identifier, they will be

00:29:45.316 --> 00:29:47.126 A:middle
delivered to your content

00:29:47.126 --> 00:29:49.466 A:middle
extension using the same did

00:29:49.466 --> 00:29:50.856 A:middle
received notification method

00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:51.856 A:middle
that you receive at the

00:29:51.856 --> 00:29:52.266 A:middle
beginning.

00:29:56.316 --> 00:29:58.956 A:middle
And lastly, if you display, if

00:29:58.956 --> 00:30:01.086 A:middle
you already displayed additional


00:29:58.956 --> 00:30:01.086 A:middle
you already displayed additional

00:30:01.086 --> 00:30:02.696 A:middle
notifications to the user by

00:30:03.216 --> 00:30:04.946 A:middle
loading them from the delivery

00:30:04.946 --> 00:30:05.826 A:middle
notifications.

00:30:06.186 --> 00:30:08.156 A:middle
Or by loading them from your own

00:30:08.276 --> 00:30:10.366 A:middle
API, you should remove them from

00:30:10.366 --> 00:30:11.576 A:middle
Notification Center.

00:30:11.906 --> 00:30:13.996 A:middle
To continue keeping Notification

00:30:13.996 --> 00:30:16.736 A:middle
Center organized and more

00:30:16.736 --> 00:30:16.966 A:middle
efficient.

00:30:18.336 --> 00:30:20.696 A:middle
I want to recap a little what we

00:30:20.696 --> 00:30:21.356 A:middle
talked about.

00:30:21.926 --> 00:30:23.666 A:middle
It was a long presentation, and

00:30:23.796 --> 00:30:25.156 A:middle
there were a lot of details.

00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:26.676 A:middle
But I only have two very

00:30:26.676 --> 00:30:27.716 A:middle
important things that I want you

00:30:27.716 --> 00:30:28.506 A:middle
to remember here.

00:30:29.036 --> 00:30:31.266 A:middle
The first one is the goal of

00:30:31.266 --> 00:30:32.266 A:middle
notification grouping.

00:30:32.816 --> 00:30:33.866 A:middle
The goal of notification

00:30:33.866 --> 00:30:36.166 A:middle
grouping is to better organize

00:30:36.166 --> 00:30:38.146 A:middle
Notification Center and help

00:30:38.146 --> 00:30:40.706 A:middle
your users be more efficient in

00:30:40.706 --> 00:30:41.456 A:middle
when they're using your

00:30:41.456 --> 00:30:42.186 A:middle
notifications.

00:30:42.576 --> 00:30:44.116 A:middle
This will help them triage them,

00:30:44.336 --> 00:30:46.026 A:middle
and will have them receiving

00:30:46.026 --> 00:30:47.176 A:middle
important information more

00:30:47.176 --> 00:30:49.336 A:middle
quickly and react better.

00:30:50.576 --> 00:30:55.066 A:middle
And the second thing I want you

00:30:55.066 --> 00:30:57.096 A:middle
to remember is to add custom

00:30:57.096 --> 00:30:58.526 A:middle
summaries to improve clarity.

00:30:59.336 --> 00:31:00.746 A:middle
As you see in my examples, for


00:30:59.336 --> 00:31:00.746 A:middle
As you see in my examples, for

00:31:00.746 --> 00:31:03.036 A:middle
example in podcasts or in Mail,

00:31:03.776 --> 00:31:05.446 A:middle
just that little bit of text

00:31:05.556 --> 00:31:07.826 A:middle
underneath the notification

00:31:07.826 --> 00:31:09.736 A:middle
group will help to see what else

00:31:09.736 --> 00:31:10.916 A:middle
is new in that group.

00:31:11.306 --> 00:31:12.716 A:middle
And I don't need to open the

00:31:12.716 --> 00:31:14.606 A:middle
notification group just to see

00:31:15.486 --> 00:31:16.876 A:middle
everything about the content.

00:31:16.876 --> 00:31:19.226 A:middle
The summary already gives some

00:31:19.226 --> 00:31:19.846 A:middle
information.

00:31:21.206 --> 00:31:23.676 A:middle
We will have a lab shortly right

00:31:23.676 --> 00:31:25.866 A:middle
after this session, downstairs.

00:31:26.306 --> 00:31:27.706 A:middle
We will have another lab

00:31:28.056 --> 00:31:29.796 A:middle
tomorrow morning, and we look

00:31:29.796 --> 00:31:30.796 A:middle
forward to talking to you.

00:31:31.186 --> 00:31:33.656 A:middle
And on Friday, there is another

00:31:33.656 --> 00:31:35.686 A:middle
session about notifications that

00:31:35.686 --> 00:31:37.206 A:middle
talks a little bit more about

00:31:37.206 --> 00:31:38.346 A:middle
the design aspects.

00:31:38.456 --> 00:31:40.696 A:middle
About how to think about your

00:31:40.696 --> 00:31:42.446 A:middle
notifications globally across

00:31:42.446 --> 00:31:44.196 A:middle
all the user devices and across

00:31:44.196 --> 00:31:45.766 A:middle
different systems.

00:31:47.196 --> 00:31:49.176 A:middle
Thank you very much, and I'll

00:31:49.176 --> 00:31:49.696 A:middle
see you later.

00:31:50.508 --> 00:31:52.508 A:middle
[ Applause ]
