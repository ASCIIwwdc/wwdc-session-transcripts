00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:19.516 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Conor Hughes from the

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:21.216 A:middle
iOS Accessibility team and I'm

00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:22.356 A:middle
here to talk about making your

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:23.986 A:middle
drags and drops in iOS

00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:24.496 A:middle
accessible.

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:26.176 A:middle
Let's get started.

00:00:27.636 --> 00:00:29.576 A:middle
Let's briefly go over what we're

00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:30.646 A:middle
going to cover.

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:32.286 A:middle
We'll start with a very brief

00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:34.246 A:middle
refresher of the basics of Drag

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:35.036 A:middle
and Drop.

00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:36.746 A:middle
Then, we'll go into come

00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:37.866 A:middle
concepts behind the

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.456 A:middle
Accessibility Drag and Drop API.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.586 A:middle
And then, we'll go into some

00:00:41.586 --> 00:00:43.546 A:middle
examples, first, exposing an

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:44.796 A:middle
ancestor's drag from an

00:00:44.796 --> 00:00:46.676 A:middle
accessibility element, and then

00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:48.356 A:middle
exposing multiple drops from an

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:49.366 A:middle
Accessibility element.

00:00:50.986 --> 00:00:52.526 A:middle
To recap Drag and Drop at a high

00:00:52.526 --> 00:00:53.896 A:middle
level, Drag and Drop is a

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:55.866 A:middle
technology introduced with iOS

00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.696 A:middle
11 and provides powerful ways

00:00:57.696 --> 00:00:58.656 A:middle
for someone using your

00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:00.536 A:middle
application to transfer data


00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:00.536 A:middle
application to transfer data

00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:02.366 A:middle
both within the application and

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.396 A:middle
between applications.

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.836 A:middle
Drag and Drop introduced the

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:07.936 A:middle
concept of interactions, which

00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:09.246 A:middle
are hosted by views in your

00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:09.926 A:middle
application.

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:12.306 A:middle
To start a drag from a view, you

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.506 A:middle
add a UIDrag interaction object

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:15.686 A:middle
to it.

00:01:15.886 --> 00:01:17.566 A:middle
To accept a drop, you add a

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.756 A:middle
UIDrop interaction.

00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:20.556 A:middle
If you're not familiar with

00:01:20.556 --> 00:01:22.036 A:middle
these classes you should watch

00:01:22.036 --> 00:01:23.416 A:middle
the Introducing Drag and Drop

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:26.276 A:middle
session from WWDC2017 for more

00:01:26.276 --> 00:01:27.726 A:middle
information, and then come back

00:01:27.726 --> 00:01:28.326 A:middle
to this video.

00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:32.016 A:middle
Now, let's start to talk about

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:32.736 A:middle
accessibility.

00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:34.526 A:middle
Of course, you want to expose

00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:36.006 A:middle
the power of your Drag and Drop

00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:37.706 A:middle
interactions to people using

00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:38.806 A:middle
your app through an assistive

00:01:38.806 --> 00:01:40.146 A:middle
technology like Voiceover.

00:01:40.776 --> 00:01:43.146 A:middle
There are a few accessibility

00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:44.736 A:middle
problems the accessibility Drag

00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:45.996 A:middle
and Drop API's were designed to

00:01:45.996 --> 00:01:46.356 A:middle
solve.

00:01:47.396 --> 00:01:48.696 A:middle
First, your accessibility

00:01:48.696 --> 00:01:50.046 A:middle
element might not host

00:01:50.046 --> 00:01:51.226 A:middle
interactions directly.

00:01:51.706 --> 00:01:53.036 A:middle
For instance, your accessibility

00:01:53.036 --> 00:01:54.546 A:middle
element might be a view whose

00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:56.816 A:middle
subviews host interactions.

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:59.316 A:middle
Or your element might descend

00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:00.356 A:middle
from a view that hosts


00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:00.356 A:middle
from a view that hosts

00:02:00.356 --> 00:02:01.776 A:middle
interactions that are logically

00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:03.876 A:middle
associated with it.

00:02:03.876 --> 00:02:04.756 A:middle
The solution is that the

00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:06.276 A:middle
Accessibility Drag and Drop

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:08.086 A:middle
API's allow you to specify

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:09.925 A:middle
logical drags and drops to the

00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:11.966 A:middle
system in a way that makes them

00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:12.976 A:middle
usable with assistive

00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:13.756 A:middle
technologies.

00:02:14.056 --> 00:02:15.846 A:middle
Let's get into those API's now.

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:19.006 A:middle
The UIAccessibilityDragging

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:20.256 A:middle
informal protocol defines two

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.306 A:middle
properties that you use to

00:02:21.306 --> 00:02:22.526 A:middle
express drags and drops to

00:02:22.526 --> 00:02:23.216 A:middle
Accessibility.

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:25.606 A:middle
It deals with the concept of

00:02:25.606 --> 00:02:27.486 A:middle
Drag Sources and Drop Points.

00:02:28.576 --> 00:02:30.306 A:middle
Drag Sources describe where to

00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:31.826 A:middle
start drags that are associated

00:02:31.826 --> 00:02:33.746 A:middle
with an element and Drop Points

00:02:33.746 --> 00:02:35.496 A:middle
describe places associated with

00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:36.786 A:middle
an element where items can be

00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:37.306 A:middle
dropped.

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:39.076 A:middle
To use these properties, you can

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:40.616 A:middle
assign to them or override the

00:02:40.616 --> 00:02:41.686 A:middle
getter to provide data on

00:02:41.686 --> 00:02:42.176 A:middle
demand.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.306 A:middle
These drags and drops are

00:02:45.306 --> 00:02:46.756 A:middle
exposed to users of assistive

00:02:46.756 --> 00:02:48.246 A:middle
technologies in much the same

00:02:48.246 --> 00:02:49.836 A:middle
way as Accessibility custom

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:50.406 A:middle
actions are.

00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:55.756 A:middle
So, that's the API, there.

00:02:55.886 --> 00:02:57.376 A:middle
Often, drags and drops are

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:58.706 A:middle
exposed automatically to

00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:00.176 A:middle
Accessibility by the system.


00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:00.176 A:middle
Accessibility by the system.

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:03.006 A:middle
And if they're found

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:04.436 A:middle
automatically they're assigned a

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:07.096 A:middle
default name but note that only

00:03:07.096 --> 00:03:08.566 A:middle
interactions in an element

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:10.016 A:middle
subtree are automatically

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:10.696 A:middle
exposed.

00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:13.356 A:middle
The UIAccessibilityDragging

00:03:13.356 --> 00:03:15.196 A:middle
protocol allows you to expose

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:16.596 A:middle
exactly the interactions that

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.426 A:middle
make sense, wherever they may

00:03:18.426 --> 00:03:19.446 A:middle
actually live in your View

00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:20.006 A:middle
hierarchy.

00:03:20.956 --> 00:03:22.406 A:middle
Allows you to specify a great

00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:23.506 A:middle
name for each one.

00:03:23.506 --> 00:03:26.346 A:middle
So, you should really consider

00:03:26.346 --> 00:03:27.646 A:middle
implementing it to provide the

00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:29.166 A:middle
best experience for someone

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:30.436 A:middle
using your application through

00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:31.446 A:middle
an assistive technology.

00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:35.216 A:middle
Now, let's look at an example of

00:03:35.216 --> 00:03:36.676 A:middle
how you can expose drags with

00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:38.046 A:middle
the UIAccessibilityDragging

00:03:38.536 --> 00:03:40.586 A:middle
informal protocol.

00:03:41.106 --> 00:03:42.576 A:middle
Let's say we're building a bar

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:44.326 A:middle
graph and we've chosen to draw

00:03:44.326 --> 00:03:46.806 A:middle
the bars by configuring CALayer

00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:47.366 A:middle
objects.

00:03:47.366 --> 00:03:49.376 A:middle
And we're going to try and

00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:51.836 A:middle
enable dragging of the bars

00:03:51.836 --> 00:03:53.226 A:middle
themselves, to drag the bar

00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:53.506 A:middle
data.

00:03:53.996 --> 00:03:56.896 A:middle
So, here is an example of how

00:03:56.896 --> 00:03:57.536 A:middle
that might look.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:59.216 A:middle
And again, each of these bars is

00:03:59.216 --> 00:04:00.966 A:middle
going to be a CALayer object.


00:03:59.216 --> 00:04:00.966 A:middle
going to be a CALayer object.

00:04:01.556 --> 00:04:03.286 A:middle
How would we go about

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:05.336 A:middle
implementing drag for this?

00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:08.366 A:middle
It might look something like

00:04:08.366 --> 00:04:09.000 A:middle
this.

00:04:10.346 --> 00:04:11.886 A:middle
Note that because layers aren't

00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:13.356 A:middle
views they can't host

00:04:13.356 --> 00:04:14.176 A:middle
interactions.

00:04:14.176 --> 00:04:16.106 A:middle
So, the bar graph itself has the

00:04:16.106 --> 00:04:17.176 A:middle
interaction installed.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.286 A:middle
And in this itemsForBeginning

00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:22.636 A:middle
session callback, depending on

00:04:22.636 --> 00:04:24.926 A:middle
the bar that is hit tested, we

00:04:24.926 --> 00:04:27.376 A:middle
return different data in the

00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:28.086 A:middle
drag item.

00:04:29.156 --> 00:04:30.266 A:middle
Note that even though I only

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:32.086 A:middle
have one drag interaction I am

00:04:32.086 --> 00:04:33.716 A:middle
using it to support multiple

00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:34.816 A:middle
logical drags.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.376 A:middle
This is a totally supported

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:37.836 A:middle
approach and it is an example of

00:04:37.836 --> 00:04:39.466 A:middle
how powerful, in general, the

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:41.116 A:middle
base Drag and Drop API's are.

00:04:41.726 --> 00:04:44.356 A:middle
Now, how do you make this

00:04:44.356 --> 00:04:44.946 A:middle
accessible?

00:04:45.086 --> 00:04:46.986 A:middle
A good approach to making a

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:49.596 A:middle
graph like this accessible is to

00:04:49.596 --> 00:04:51.836 A:middle
expose each bar as an

00:04:51.836 --> 00:04:54.076 A:middle
Accessibility element, which

00:04:54.076 --> 00:04:54.616 A:middle
I've done here.

00:04:55.676 --> 00:04:57.346 A:middle
Note that what I'm doing here is

00:04:57.346 --> 00:04:58.946 A:middle
providing data about the logical

00:04:58.946 --> 00:05:01.096 A:middle
structure of my app's content to


00:04:58.946 --> 00:05:01.096 A:middle
structure of my app's content to

00:05:01.096 --> 00:05:02.436 A:middle
the Accessibility Runtime.

00:05:02.946 --> 00:05:03.916 A:middle
That enables assistive

00:05:03.916 --> 00:05:05.356 A:middle
technologies to expose the

00:05:05.356 --> 00:05:06.726 A:middle
content in a different way.

00:05:07.686 --> 00:05:08.976 A:middle
We'll need to do the same thing

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:10.276 A:middle
to make the drags accessible,

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:12.126 A:middle
and to do so we'll need to learn

00:05:12.126 --> 00:05:13.466 A:middle
some more specifics about the

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:15.526 A:middle
UIAccessibilityDragging informal

00:05:15.526 --> 00:05:15.966 A:middle
protocol.

00:05:17.326 --> 00:05:19.266 A:middle
First, let's learn about the

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:20.456 A:middle
class UIAccessibility

00:05:20.456 --> 00:05:21.426 A:middle
LocationDescriptor.

00:05:22.436 --> 00:05:24.806 A:middle
This class is data that

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:26.516 A:middle
describes where an interaction

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:30.686 A:middle
is by specifying a point in a

00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:33.896 A:middle
view with a particular name.

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:37.086 A:middle
So, for an example in our bar

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:39.776 A:middle
graph, a location descriptor for

00:05:39.776 --> 00:05:42.736 A:middle
dragging that bar there, might

00:05:42.736 --> 00:05:43.486 A:middle
look like this.

00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:45.516 A:middle
Its name might be Drag Bar Data.

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:47.766 A:middle
The view would be the bar graph

00:05:47.766 --> 00:05:48.516 A:middle
view itself.

00:05:48.516 --> 00:05:49.796 A:middle
And the point would be a point

00:05:49.796 --> 00:05:50.976 A:middle
that's located within the bar.

00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:54.896 A:middle
So, what do we do with

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:55.666 A:middle
UIAccessibility

00:05:55.666 --> 00:05:56.906 A:middle
LocationDescriptor options?

00:05:58.056 --> 00:05:59.326 A:middle
Well, we assign them to the two

00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:00.616 A:middle
properties mentioned earlier.


00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:00.616 A:middle
properties mentioned earlier.

00:06:01.136 --> 00:06:03.186 A:middle
The two properties in the

00:06:03.186 --> 00:06:04.966 A:middle
protocol are accessibilityDrag

00:06:04.966 --> 00:06:05.916 A:middle
SourceDescriptors and

00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:06.816 A:middle
accessibilityDrop

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:07.686 A:middle
PointDescriptors.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.276 A:middle
DragSourceDescriptors is used to

00:06:11.276 --> 00:06:13.056 A:middle
expose drag sources that are

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:14.416 A:middle
logically associated with an

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.736 A:middle
element and DropPointDescriptors

00:06:16.846 --> 00:06:18.966 A:middle
exposes places to drop that are

00:06:18.966 --> 00:06:20.066 A:middle
logically associated with this

00:06:20.066 --> 00:06:20.516 A:middle
element.

00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:22.506 A:middle
These are the properties you use

00:06:22.506 --> 00:06:23.956 A:middle
to describe to Accessibility

00:06:24.026 --> 00:06:25.646 A:middle
what can be dragged from and

00:06:25.646 --> 00:06:27.396 A:middle
dropped into a given element.

00:06:28.556 --> 00:06:30.496 A:middle
One important point to be aware

00:06:30.496 --> 00:06:31.856 A:middle
of is that the descriptors must

00:06:31.856 --> 00:06:33.336 A:middle
reference the View that actually

00:06:33.336 --> 00:06:34.406 A:middle
has the interaction.

00:06:34.796 --> 00:06:36.216 A:middle
So, for instance, you shouldn't

00:06:36.216 --> 00:06:37.676 A:middle
reference a point in your window

00:06:37.676 --> 00:06:38.966 A:middle
that happens to be within the

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:40.326 A:middle
View that hosts the interaction.

00:06:40.486 --> 00:06:41.646 A:middle
You should specify that view

00:06:41.646 --> 00:06:42.156 A:middle
itself.

00:06:44.336 --> 00:06:46.206 A:middle
So, pulling it together; to

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:47.816 A:middle
expose a single drag from some

00:06:47.816 --> 00:06:49.036 A:middle
element doesn't take that much

00:06:49.036 --> 00:06:49.496 A:middle
code, at all.

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:51.056 A:middle
You make a Descriptor that

00:06:51.056 --> 00:06:52.336 A:middle
specifies that drag by

00:06:52.336 --> 00:06:53.826 A:middle
specifying a point in the View

00:06:53.826 --> 00:06:55.046 A:middle
that hosts the interaction and

00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:55.576 A:middle
giving it a name.

00:06:55.576 --> 00:06:57.166 A:middle
And then, you set the

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:58.056 A:middle
accessibilityDrag

00:06:58.056 --> 00:06:59.736 A:middle
SourceDescriptors property

00:06:59.736 --> 00:07:00.976 A:middle
element to an array that


00:06:59.736 --> 00:07:00.976 A:middle
element to an array that

00:07:00.976 --> 00:07:01.996 A:middle
includes that descriptor.

00:07:03.986 --> 00:07:05.796 A:middle
Let's go back to our bar graph

00:07:05.796 --> 00:07:07.156 A:middle
code that set the Accessibility

00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:08.306 A:middle
elements of the graph view.

00:07:08.556 --> 00:07:10.226 A:middle
What do we need to do to expose

00:07:10.226 --> 00:07:11.500 A:middle
dragging each element?

00:07:14.286 --> 00:07:15.636 A:middle
We compute a point within the

00:07:15.636 --> 00:07:17.636 A:middle
bar represented by that element

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:19.226 A:middle
in the View's coordinate space,

00:07:19.976 --> 00:07:21.296 A:middle
make an appropriate descriptor

00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:22.556 A:middle
with that point in that View.

00:07:22.556 --> 00:07:24.556 A:middle
And set the accessibilityDrag

00:07:24.556 --> 00:07:25.916 A:middle
SourceDescriptors property of

00:07:25.916 --> 00:07:26.486 A:middle
the element.

00:07:26.566 --> 00:07:27.236 A:middle
And that's it.

00:07:30.446 --> 00:07:31.326 A:middle
Now, let's look at a slightly

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:31.996 A:middle
different example.

00:07:32.216 --> 00:07:34.086 A:middle
Let's try to expose multiple

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:35.576 A:middle
drops from a single element.

00:07:36.626 --> 00:07:37.766 A:middle
This might be useful for a

00:07:37.766 --> 00:07:39.656 A:middle
situation like a contact card,

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:41.746 A:middle
where the card is small enough

00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:44.736 A:middle
that we're going to expose it as

00:07:44.736 --> 00:07:47.406 A:middle
one element to Accessibility.

00:07:47.766 --> 00:07:49.796 A:middle
But there are multiple wells

00:07:49.796 --> 00:07:52.486 A:middle
into which we can drop content

00:07:52.486 --> 00:07:54.466 A:middle
into the card.

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:55.746 A:middle
So, for instance, it might have

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:58.126 A:middle
a portrait and a space for you

00:07:58.126 --> 00:07:59.986 A:middle
to drop arbitrary attachments

00:07:59.986 --> 00:08:00.736 A:middle
for that contact.


00:07:59.986 --> 00:08:00.736 A:middle
for that contact.

00:08:01.546 --> 00:08:03.966 A:middle
Now, that we know how to use the

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:05.686 A:middle
UIAccessibilityDragging informal

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:07.056 A:middle
protocol, exposing these is

00:08:07.056 --> 00:08:07.736 A:middle
straightforward.

00:08:09.036 --> 00:08:11.126 A:middle
We can override the

00:08:11.126 --> 00:08:12.096 A:middle
accessibilityDrop

00:08:12.096 --> 00:08:13.676 A:middle
PointDescriptors getter of the

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:17.346 A:middle
View, compute the midpoints of

00:08:17.346 --> 00:08:19.626 A:middle
the two wells, and then return

00:08:19.626 --> 00:08:20.966 A:middle
two location descriptors that

00:08:20.966 --> 00:08:22.256 A:middle
name each drop point.

00:08:24.616 --> 00:08:26.276 A:middle
So, in summary, because you want

00:08:26.276 --> 00:08:27.656 A:middle
everyone to be able to use all

00:08:27.656 --> 00:08:29.206 A:middle
the cool features you build into

00:08:29.206 --> 00:08:31.136 A:middle
your app, you want to make sure

00:08:32.206 --> 00:08:33.926 A:middle
that the drags and drops

00:08:33.926 --> 00:08:35.316 A:middle
associated with Accessibility

00:08:35.316 --> 00:08:36.876 A:middle
elements in your app are exposed

00:08:36.876 --> 00:08:38.106 A:middle
to assistive technologies.

00:08:38.916 --> 00:08:40.015 A:middle
To do so, use the

00:08:40.015 --> 00:08:41.096 A:middle
accessibilityDrag

00:08:41.096 --> 00:08:42.535 A:middle
SourceDescriptors property to

00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:43.916 A:middle
specify what drag should be

00:08:43.916 --> 00:08:45.546 A:middle
exposed, and the

00:08:45.546 --> 00:08:46.496 A:middle
accessibilityDrop

00:08:46.496 --> 00:08:48.256 A:middle
PointDescriptors property to

00:08:48.256 --> 00:08:49.346 A:middle
specify what drop should be

00:08:49.346 --> 00:08:49.876 A:middle
exposed.

00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:51.746 A:middle
Finally, these properties are

00:08:51.746 --> 00:08:53.506 A:middle
just arrays of UIAccessibility

00:08:53.506 --> 00:08:54.906 A:middle
LocationDescriptor objects,

00:08:55.236 --> 00:08:56.836 A:middle
which describe to Accessibility

00:08:57.066 --> 00:08:58.796 A:middle
where these drags and drops are

00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:01.006 A:middle
in your application and how to


00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:01.006 A:middle
in your application and how to

00:09:01.276 --> 00:09:02.806 A:middle
activate them.

00:09:02.926 --> 00:09:03.986 A:middle
