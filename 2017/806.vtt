&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.456 A:middle
My name is Carolyn Cranfill and

00:02:47.976 --> 00:02:50.326 A:middle
Because we inherently design for

00:02:50.326 --> 00:02:52.166 A:middle
ourselves, because we design to

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:54.076 A:middle

We think of features, make an

00:02:59.556 --> 00:03:01.236 A:middle
app, join a company to put those

00:03:01.236 --> 00:03:03.036 A:middle
ideas out there for others too.

But regardless, the next step of

00:03:06.516 --> 00:03:08.386 A:middle
reaching more people is putting

00:03:08.386 --> 00:03:10.036 A:middle

00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:20.276 A:middle

00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:22.426 A:middle

include conditions like carpal

and colorblindness.

and distracting graphics.

00:05:22.146 --> 00:05:24.016 A:middle
And there are also many adults

and children with dyslexia.

00:05:26.206 --> 00:05:28.076 A:middle

00:05:36.246 --> 00:05:37.776 A:middle
So, if we think about how

00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:39.126 A:middle
everyone in the world will have

00:05:39.126 --> 00:05:40.756 A:middle
a range of abilities and

To help you do this, we're going

00:06:25.396 --> 00:06:26.646 A:middle
to talk about some design

00:06:26.646 --> 00:06:28.206 A:middle
considerations and workflow

00:06:28.206 --> 00:06:30.216 A:middle
techniques to keep in mind when

00:06:30.216 --> 00:06:31.426 A:middle

sound, and haptics.

00:07:01.256 --> 00:07:04.446 A:middle
And designing with integrity.

00:07:04.676 --> 00:07:06.276 A:middle
Holding ourselves accountable

00:07:06.276 --> 00:07:08.026 A:middle
for ethically making sure we

00:07:08.026 --> 00:07:09.116 A:middle
include everyone.

00:07:10.036 --> 00:07:11.796 A:middle
These are principles applied to

00:07:11.796 --> 00:07:13.276 A:middle
making great experiences,

00:07:13.586 --> 00:07:14.166 A:middle
period.

00:07:16.556 --> 00:07:19.266 A:middle
So, first if we think about

00:07:19.266 --> 00:07:20.586 A:middle
something that is simple to do,

00:07:20.996 --> 00:07:22.446 A:middle
we think of it being effortless

00:07:22.556 --> 00:07:24.456 A:middle
without difficulties, hurdles,

00:07:24.456 --> 00:07:25.746 A:middle
or cognitive strain.

00:07:26.626 --> 00:07:28.426 A:middle
But for something to feel simple

00:07:28.426 --> 00:07:29.646 A:middle
that does mean it can't do

00:07:29.646 --> 00:07:30.626 A:middle
complex things.

00:07:31.406 --> 00:07:32.776 A:middle
It just means trying to achieve

00:07:32.776 --> 00:07:34.546 A:middle
desired outcomes in the most

00:07:34.546 --> 00:07:35.956 A:middle
effortless and elegant way

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:36.596 A:middle
possible.

00:07:37.586 --> 00:07:38.986 A:middle
Things that aren't simple create

00:07:38.986 --> 00:07:41.156 A:middle
barriers of entry to everyone.

00:07:41.756 --> 00:07:45.996 A:middle
As we go through our day, the

00:07:45.996 --> 00:07:47.476 A:middle
requirements of work and life

00:07:47.606 --> 00:07:49.086 A:middle
slowly drains our energy.

00:07:49.796 --> 00:07:51.656 A:middle
And when we are low on energy,

00:07:51.886 --> 00:07:53.356 A:middle
we have less energy to

00:07:53.356 --> 00:07:55.176 A:middle
troubleshoot tech and less

00:07:55.176 --> 00:07:56.306 A:middle
patience for navigating

00:07:56.306 --> 00:07:57.286 A:middle
something that should be quick

00:07:57.286 --> 00:07:57.796 A:middle
and easy.

00:07:59.066 --> 00:08:01.476 A:middle
At night, we rest and recharge.

00:08:03.456 --> 00:08:06.206 A:middle
However, were you aware that one

00:08:06.206 --> 00:08:07.556 A:middle
in six children in the United

00:08:07.556 --> 00:08:08.746 A:middle
States have a developmental

00:08:08.746 --> 00:08:09.636 A:middle
disability?

00:08:10.316 --> 00:08:11.346 A:middle
It ranges from mild

00:08:11.346 --> 00:08:12.636 A:middle
disabilities, such as speech and

00:08:12.636 --> 00:08:14.566 A:middle
language impairments to serious

00:08:14.566 --> 00:08:16.366 A:middle
developmental disabilities, such

00:08:16.366 --> 00:08:18.026 A:middle
as intellectual disabilities and

00:08:18.026 --> 00:08:18.616 A:middle
autism.

00:08:19.836 --> 00:08:21.696 A:middle
For people who have cognitive

00:08:21.696 --> 00:08:23.486 A:middle
disabilities and/or chronic

00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:25.546 A:middle
illnesses, they might start out

00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:27.206 A:middle
the day at three-quarters of a

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:27.536 A:middle
tank.

00:08:28.006 --> 00:08:29.686 A:middle
And tasks take extra effort

00:08:29.686 --> 00:08:30.726 A:middle
throughout the day.

00:08:31.646 --> 00:08:34.016 A:middle
Plus, if you exert yourself all

00:08:34.016 --> 00:08:35.886 A:middle
the way to empty on one day, you

00:08:36.186 --> 00:08:37.496 A:middle
might start out the next day,

00:08:37.496 --> 00:08:38.486 A:middle
extremely low.

00:08:39.566 --> 00:08:42.026 A:middle
So, the apps that we make do a

00:08:42.026 --> 00:08:44.186 A:middle
great job at helping us through

00:08:44.186 --> 00:08:44.626 A:middle
our day.

00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:46.706 A:middle
Whether it's a convenience or

00:08:46.706 --> 00:08:48.046 A:middle
helping us to recharge.

00:08:49.676 --> 00:08:51.046 A:middle
They provide quick and easy

00:08:51.046 --> 00:08:53.196 A:middle
access to services, which is

00:08:53.196 --> 00:08:55.296 A:middle
extremely important for those

00:08:55.386 --> 00:08:56.346 A:middle
who may have difficulty

00:08:56.346 --> 00:08:57.766 A:middle
traveling outside of the home,

00:08:58.106 --> 00:08:59.596 A:middle
speaking a hearing on the phone,

00:09:00.076 --> 00:09:01.826 A:middle
or juggling work and home life.

00:09:03.566 --> 00:09:06.026 A:middle
For example, convenience apps

00:09:06.026 --> 00:09:08.346 A:middle
like Instacart, you can have

00:09:08.346 --> 00:09:10.086 A:middle
groceries delivered to your door

00:09:10.566 --> 00:09:11.756 A:middle
which alleviates the stress of

00:09:11.756 --> 00:09:13.836 A:middle
the supermarket, or allows you

00:09:13.836 --> 00:09:14.686 A:middle
to rest at home.

00:09:14.746 --> 00:09:16.816 A:middle
Or maybe it just gives you time

00:09:16.816 --> 00:09:17.806 A:middle
back with your family.

00:09:19.646 --> 00:09:20.886 A:middle
With education apps like

00:09:20.886 --> 00:09:23.366 A:middle
Doulingo it's incredible that we

00:09:23.366 --> 00:09:25.636 A:middle
can learn from the comforts of

00:09:25.636 --> 00:09:28.046 A:middle
our home, on our own time, at

00:09:28.046 --> 00:09:31.716 A:middle
our own speed, and with health

00:09:31.716 --> 00:09:33.756 A:middle
apps like Calm, they help us

00:09:33.756 --> 00:09:35.466 A:middle
nurture our mental and physical

00:09:35.466 --> 00:09:36.166 A:middle
well-being.

00:09:36.796 --> 00:09:39.716 A:middle
And with content creation apps

00:09:39.716 --> 00:09:41.696 A:middle
like iMovie, we can create and

00:09:41.696 --> 00:09:43.676 A:middle
share our artistry with friends,

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:44.996 A:middle
family and the world.

00:09:46.636 --> 00:09:48.526 A:middle
So, apps play a key role in our

00:09:48.526 --> 00:09:49.626 A:middle
daily lives now.

00:09:50.086 --> 00:09:51.906 A:middle
And we can make even more impact

00:09:52.016 --> 00:09:53.756 A:middle
in people's lives by reducing

00:09:53.756 --> 00:09:55.376 A:middle
the amount of effort that we

00:09:55.376 --> 00:09:57.726 A:middle
require to use our apps, which

00:09:57.726 --> 00:10:00.116 A:middle
reduces barriers and provides

00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:01.016 A:middle
more access.

00:10:02.046 --> 00:10:03.196 A:middle
But this is easier said than

00:10:03.196 --> 00:10:03.556 A:middle
done.

00:10:03.796 --> 00:10:04.856 A:middle
So here are some ideas.

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.416 A:middle
We should strive for our apps to

00:10:08.416 --> 00:10:10.406 A:middle
be easy to navigate by having

00:10:10.406 --> 00:10:11.816 A:middle
them similarly structured.

00:10:11.816 --> 00:10:14.826 A:middle
We need to be able to get

00:10:14.876 --> 00:10:17.106 A:middle
started and complete common task

00:10:17.256 --> 00:10:18.636 A:middle
without encountering any

00:10:18.636 --> 00:10:19.996 A:middle
barriers or issues.

00:10:21.636 --> 00:10:23.616 A:middle
And we should use UIKit as much

00:10:23.616 --> 00:10:25.236 A:middle
as possible to achieve the

00:10:25.236 --> 00:10:27.086 A:middle
consistent behaviors within each

00:10:27.086 --> 00:10:28.566 A:middle
app and across apps.

00:10:29.016 --> 00:10:30.966 A:middle
Because UIKit wasn't made for

00:10:30.966 --> 00:10:32.006 A:middle
just developers.

00:10:32.226 --> 00:10:33.856 A:middle
It's a design language for the

00:10:33.856 --> 00:10:35.886 A:middle
platform that everyone is

00:10:35.956 --> 00:10:37.466 A:middle
familiar with and knows how to

00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:37.966 A:middle
use.

00:10:38.506 --> 00:10:41.506 A:middle
And there are design resources

00:10:41.506 --> 00:10:43.386 A:middle
on human interface guidelines to

00:10:43.386 --> 00:10:45.026 A:middle
help you use the standard UIKit

00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:46.866 A:middle
components in your apps during

00:10:46.866 --> 00:10:47.596 A:middle
the design phase.

00:10:48.316 --> 00:10:50.356 A:middle
It's important to remember that

00:10:50.356 --> 00:10:52.256 A:middle
these toolkits support many

00:10:52.256 --> 00:10:54.146 A:middle
accessibility accommodations.

00:10:55.456 --> 00:10:58.086 A:middle
And if we can consistently use

00:10:58.086 --> 00:10:59.496 A:middle
standard UIKit interaction

00:10:59.496 --> 00:11:01.416 A:middle
patterns and components for more

00:11:01.416 --> 00:11:03.446 A:middle
task of our apps like basic

00:11:03.446 --> 00:11:05.096 A:middle
structure and navigation,

00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:07.566 A:middle
sign-up flows, account settings,

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:10.846 A:middle
and sharing then you can spend

00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:12.596 A:middle
the majority of your time on the

00:11:12.596 --> 00:11:14.116 A:middle
parts of your apps that make

00:11:14.116 --> 00:11:14.746 A:middle
them special.

00:11:15.426 --> 00:11:17.076 A:middle
And making sure those parts are

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:17.966 A:middle
accessible too.

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.226 A:middle
Consistent use of our design

00:11:21.226 --> 00:11:23.166 A:middle
language is beneficial because

00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:25.066 A:middle
if you learn one app you have a

00:11:25.136 --> 00:11:27.386 A:middle
serious head start on learning

00:11:27.386 --> 00:11:30.996 A:middle
another because repetition

00:11:30.996 --> 00:11:32.676 A:middle
creates cognitive ease and a

00:11:32.676 --> 00:11:33.766 A:middle
comforting feeling of

00:11:33.766 --> 00:11:34.546 A:middle
familiarity.

00:11:35.086 --> 00:11:37.846 A:middle
But we know it's not always

00:11:37.846 --> 00:11:40.176 A:middle
possible, to solely use UIKit.

00:11:40.176 --> 00:11:41.326 A:middle
There are times when you need to

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.546 A:middle
do something unique and

00:11:42.546 --> 00:11:44.626 A:middle
original, but don't forget about

00:11:44.626 --> 00:11:45.406 A:middle
accessibility.

00:11:45.406 --> 00:11:47.276 A:middle
It makes you think more

00:11:47.276 --> 00:11:48.636 A:middle
holistically about the products

00:11:48.636 --> 00:11:49.526 A:middle
that you're putting out into the

00:11:49.526 --> 00:11:49.856 A:middle
world.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:52.886 A:middle
So, simplicity.

00:11:52.886 --> 00:11:54.536 A:middle
Building on what I know.

00:11:54.916 --> 00:11:57.006 A:middle
Making use of standard

00:11:57.006 --> 00:11:58.486 A:middle
components and familiar

00:11:58.486 --> 00:12:00.266 A:middle
interaction patterns to help

00:12:00.266 --> 00:12:02.846 A:middle
make apps easy to navigate.

00:12:03.766 --> 00:12:05.436 A:middle
Be laser focused in your

00:12:05.436 --> 00:12:06.056 A:middle
objectives.

00:12:06.526 --> 00:12:07.726 A:middle
Reduce any hurdles.

00:12:08.066 --> 00:12:09.616 A:middle
Help me get started quickly.

00:12:09.616 --> 00:12:12.286 A:middle
And it just works like I

00:12:12.286 --> 00:12:13.936 A:middle
expected it to consistently.

00:12:16.596 --> 00:12:20.146 A:middle
So, our products need to be

00:12:20.146 --> 00:12:22.086 A:middle
understandable and perceivable

00:12:22.086 --> 00:12:22.696 A:middle
to everyone.

00:12:23.656 --> 00:12:25.186 A:middle
This means that information

00:12:25.586 --> 00:12:27.046 A:middle
needs to be available to at

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:29.196 A:middle
least one sense; sight, sound or

00:12:29.196 --> 00:12:31.156 A:middle
touch that is available to each

00:12:31.156 --> 00:12:31.606 A:middle
person.

00:12:31.856 --> 00:12:34.606 A:middle
And we can look at our apps and

00:12:34.666 --> 00:12:36.736 A:middle
ask ourselves is it legible?

00:12:36.736 --> 00:12:38.526 A:middle
Is it audible?

00:12:38.526 --> 00:12:39.956 A:middle
And is it tactile?

00:12:41.366 --> 00:12:43.396 A:middle
But before we look at

00:12:43.396 --> 00:12:44.506 A:middle
legibility.

00:12:44.506 --> 00:12:45.976 A:middle
Let's escape for a moment to

00:12:45.976 --> 00:12:47.056 A:middle
this beautiful beach and

00:12:47.056 --> 00:12:49.586 A:middle
experience it in a few different

00:12:49.586 --> 00:12:49.866 A:middle
ways.

00:12:51.656 --> 00:12:54.396 A:middle
Relax, watch the waves roll in

00:12:54.396 --> 00:12:54.816 A:middle
and out.

00:12:55.186 --> 00:12:56.596 A:middle
Soak up that sunshine for a

00:12:56.596 --> 00:12:56.936 A:middle
second.

00:13:02.056 --> 00:13:03.326 A:middle
And if you have vision loss, you

00:13:03.326 --> 00:13:05.136 A:middle
might not get to see this in all

00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:07.096 A:middle
of its glory, but you're hearing

00:13:07.346 --> 00:13:08.786 A:middle
would be more sensitive to these

00:13:08.826 --> 00:13:09.686 A:middle
beautiful sounds.

00:13:10.516 --> 00:13:15.806 A:middle
[ Ocean Sounds ]

00:13:16.306 --> 00:13:18.056 A:middle
Or if you're colorblind, you

00:13:18.056 --> 00:13:19.346 A:middle
might see the world more like

00:13:19.426 --> 00:13:19.606 A:middle
this.

00:13:24.176 --> 00:13:26.066 A:middle
Or if you're blind, you're

00:13:26.066 --> 00:13:28.076 A:middle
likely even more in-tune to the

00:13:31.716 --> 00:13:31.836 A:middle
sound.

00:13:33.096 --> 00:13:34.656 A:middle
And these situations are very

00:13:34.656 --> 00:13:35.066 A:middle
real.

00:13:35.146 --> 00:13:38.316 A:middle
In the world, 285 million people

00:13:38.316 --> 00:13:39.616 A:middle
are estimated to have moderate

00:13:39.616 --> 00:13:41.576 A:middle
or severe vision loss.

00:13:41.986 --> 00:13:43.946 A:middle
And 39 million of those are

00:13:43.946 --> 00:13:44.736 A:middle
completely blind.

00:13:46.736 --> 00:13:48.566 A:middle
And one in 12 men are

00:13:48.566 --> 00:13:49.286 A:middle
colorblind.

00:13:50.856 --> 00:13:52.326 A:middle
And best estimates are around

00:13:52.326 --> 00:13:54.696 A:middle
360 million people in the world

00:13:54.696 --> 00:13:56.226 A:middle
have disabling hearing loss.

00:13:56.776 --> 00:13:59.456 A:middle
Not only can hearing and vision

00:13:59.456 --> 00:14:00.856 A:middle
loss limit people from

00:14:00.856 --> 00:14:02.416 A:middle
distinguishing information, but

00:14:02.756 --> 00:14:04.236 A:middle
they will also be seeing and

00:14:04.236 --> 00:14:05.646 A:middle
hearing your brand in different

00:14:05.646 --> 00:14:06.806 A:middle
ways than you expected.

00:14:07.296 --> 00:14:09.916 A:middle
For example, someone with low

00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:13.066 A:middle
vision may see their phones like

00:14:13.066 --> 00:14:13.486 A:middle
this.

00:14:14.506 --> 00:14:16.086 A:middle
And if you aren't low vision

00:14:16.086 --> 00:14:17.836 A:middle
yourself, you can simulate low

00:14:17.836 --> 00:14:19.856 A:middle
vision by using a small blur in

00:14:19.856 --> 00:14:20.856 A:middle
your design software.

00:14:22.756 --> 00:14:24.376 A:middle
Now, people with low vision will

00:14:24.376 --> 00:14:26.126 A:middle
often learn the location of

00:14:26.126 --> 00:14:27.866 A:middle
icons as long as they don't

00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:28.176 A:middle
move.

00:14:28.656 --> 00:14:30.966 A:middle
But content areas are different.

00:14:30.966 --> 00:14:32.496 A:middle
So, they need to maintain high

00:14:32.616 --> 00:14:34.856 A:middle
visual contrast to increase

00:14:34.856 --> 00:14:35.636 A:middle
legibility.

00:14:36.676 --> 00:14:38.606 A:middle
So, if you get started, you

00:14:38.606 --> 00:14:41.536 A:middle
should ask yourself is your app

00:14:41.536 --> 00:14:41.986 A:middle
legible?

00:14:43.186 --> 00:14:45.296 A:middle
Because maximizing legibility is

00:14:45.296 --> 00:14:47.016 A:middle
the highest benefit on being

00:14:47.016 --> 00:14:49.146 A:middle
able to comprehend information

00:14:49.436 --> 00:14:51.416 A:middle
because it's less work on us to

00:14:51.416 --> 00:14:51.986 A:middle
interpret.

00:14:53.266 --> 00:14:55.106 A:middle
For example, when we have key

00:14:55.106 --> 00:14:56.996 A:middle
information that is low in

00:14:57.046 --> 00:14:59.946 A:middle
contrasts because of small fonts

00:15:00.356 --> 00:15:02.506 A:middle
and low color contrast ratios,

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:04.376 A:middle
or thin fonts.

00:15:05.956 --> 00:15:08.356 A:middle
It may be painful to read and

00:15:08.356 --> 00:15:10.206 A:middle
you experience cognitive strain.

00:15:10.806 --> 00:15:13.866 A:middle
So, a good place to start to

00:15:13.866 --> 00:15:15.856 A:middle
correct low contrast is to use

00:15:15.856 --> 00:15:18.966 A:middle
the default textile body for

00:15:18.966 --> 00:15:20.496 A:middle
your main content and a high

00:15:20.496 --> 00:15:22.346 A:middle
color contrast with your

00:15:22.346 --> 00:15:22.936 A:middle
background.

00:15:23.776 --> 00:15:25.716 A:middle
And then you can use bolder font

00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:28.976 A:middle
weights to emphasize text or

00:15:28.976 --> 00:15:30.826 A:middle
titles, rather than thin fonts.

00:15:31.756 --> 00:15:33.516 A:middle
And you can use filled in button

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:36.076 A:middle
shapes so that the text contrast

00:15:36.076 --> 00:15:38.646 A:middle
is high, and the way forward in

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.126 A:middle
your app is really clear.

00:15:40.776 --> 00:15:43.866 A:middle
And if you don't use textiles or

00:15:43.866 --> 00:15:45.606 A:middle
system fonts in your app, it

00:15:45.606 --> 00:15:47.316 A:middle
would be ideal to support the

00:15:47.316 --> 00:15:49.216 A:middle
accessibility bold text

00:15:49.216 --> 00:15:51.356 A:middle
settings, which requires you to

00:15:51.356 --> 00:15:53.156 A:middle
increase your font weights by

00:15:53.156 --> 00:15:54.686 A:middle
two weights thicker when the

00:15:54.686 --> 00:15:55.446 A:middle
setting is on.

00:15:56.006 --> 00:15:57.256 A:middle
Now, this is built-in with

00:15:57.366 --> 00:15:58.636 A:middle
system fonts and textiles.

00:16:00.086 --> 00:16:02.616 A:middle
The new App Store design does an

00:16:02.616 --> 00:16:04.146 A:middle
excellent job at maximizing

00:16:04.146 --> 00:16:05.496 A:middle
legibility through its bold

00:16:05.496 --> 00:16:07.296 A:middle
typography, prominent buy

00:16:07.296 --> 00:16:10.566 A:middle
buttons, large fonts, and high

00:16:10.966 --> 00:16:12.586 A:middle
color contrast colors.

00:16:13.086 --> 00:16:13.946 A:middle
Great job guys.

00:16:14.596 --> 00:16:19.406 A:middle
On macOS, there are increased

00:16:19.406 --> 00:16:21.786 A:middle
contrast settings as well, that

00:16:21.786 --> 00:16:24.586 A:middle
when on all active controls

00:16:24.866 --> 00:16:27.506 A:middle
become higher contrast by making

00:16:27.506 --> 00:16:29.896 A:middle
backgrounds opaque, button

00:16:29.896 --> 00:16:31.716 A:middle
outlines becomes thicker and

00:16:31.716 --> 00:16:35.696 A:middle
darker and system colors become

00:16:35.696 --> 00:16:37.576 A:middle
darker to create high color

00:16:37.576 --> 00:16:38.706 A:middle
contrast ratios.

00:16:39.206 --> 00:16:40.646 A:middle
So now that you know to look

00:16:40.646 --> 00:16:42.176 A:middle
for, let's look at the before

00:16:42.176 --> 00:16:42.996 A:middle
and after again.

00:16:44.106 --> 00:16:44.666 A:middle
Before.

00:16:45.996 --> 00:16:46.766 A:middle
After.

00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:50.206 A:middle
And even the ruled lines and the

00:16:50.206 --> 00:16:52.176 A:middle
color values of gray text

00:16:52.176 --> 00:16:53.016 A:middle
becomes darker.

00:16:54.106 --> 00:16:55.726 A:middle
You will need to supply these

00:16:55.766 --> 00:16:57.316 A:middle
same alternate designs, if you

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:58.876 A:middle
do not use standard AppKit

00:16:59.066 --> 00:17:00.176 A:middle
because they will not come for

00:17:00.176 --> 00:17:02.126 A:middle
free in custom UI, but they're

00:17:02.126 --> 00:17:03.726 A:middle
extremely important for

00:17:03.726 --> 00:17:04.916 A:middle
maximizing legibility.

00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:08.576 A:middle
Now, the next suggestion to

00:17:08.576 --> 00:17:09.946 A:middle
increase legibility maybe the

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:11.326 A:middle
most important thing to take

00:17:11.326 --> 00:17:11.906 A:middle
away today.

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:14.376 A:middle
And that's to support dynamic

00:17:14.376 --> 00:17:16.136 A:middle
type, or the text size setting

00:17:17.096 --> 00:17:18.756 A:middle
because this feature increases

00:17:18.756 --> 00:17:20.296 A:middle
legibility by allowing each

00:17:20.296 --> 00:17:22.176 A:middle
person to personalize their

00:17:22.176 --> 00:17:23.486 A:middle
experience by increasing the

00:17:23.486 --> 00:17:24.176 A:middle
font size.

00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:26.646 A:middle
Or, maybe you need a farther

00:17:26.646 --> 00:17:28.966 A:middle
viewing distance if mounted on a

00:17:29.146 --> 00:17:30.616 A:middle
chair or propped on a table.

00:17:32.766 --> 00:17:34.016 A:middle
Because when our fonts don't

00:17:34.116 --> 00:17:35.976 A:middle
scale, people with low vision

00:17:35.976 --> 00:17:37.576 A:middle
need to use screen zoom windows

00:17:37.576 --> 00:17:38.866 A:middle
to read the content.

00:17:39.556 --> 00:17:41.286 A:middle
That's like having to turn your

00:17:41.286 --> 00:17:43.126 A:middle
light on, or your magnifier in a

00:17:43.126 --> 00:17:45.066 A:middle
dimly lit restaurant to read the

00:17:45.066 --> 00:17:45.566 A:middle
menu.

00:17:45.806 --> 00:17:47.946 A:middle
But except this is all day and

00:17:47.946 --> 00:17:48.456 A:middle
every day.

00:17:48.456 --> 00:17:51.366 A:middle
And some people don't bother

00:17:51.366 --> 00:17:52.516 A:middle
with zoom windows at all.

00:17:52.956 --> 00:17:54.296 A:middle
They painfully read the small

00:17:54.296 --> 00:17:56.086 A:middle
type or use their phones for

00:17:56.086 --> 00:17:57.276 A:middle
short periods of time.

00:17:57.536 --> 00:17:58.406 A:middle
And that's not a great

00:17:58.406 --> 00:17:59.036 A:middle
experience.

00:18:00.166 --> 00:18:02.356 A:middle
So, if you adopt dynamic type by

00:18:02.356 --> 00:18:04.486 A:middle
using textiles and use the new

00:18:04.526 --> 00:18:07.216 A:middle
standard spacing constraints, we

00:18:07.216 --> 00:18:08.596 A:middle
can offer a larger reading

00:18:08.596 --> 00:18:09.986 A:middle
experience without needing zoom

00:18:09.986 --> 00:18:10.416 A:middle
windows.

00:18:11.336 --> 00:18:13.476 A:middle
And new this year in iOS 11 is

00:18:13.476 --> 00:18:15.116 A:middle
dynamic type support for custom

00:18:15.116 --> 00:18:15.536 A:middle
fonts.

00:18:17.516 --> 00:18:19.276 A:middle
Additionally, if you access

00:18:19.366 --> 00:18:20.676 A:middle
larger text setting via the

00:18:20.676 --> 00:18:22.236 A:middle
general settings, there's a

00:18:22.236 --> 00:18:24.916 A:middle
switch that enables even larger

00:18:24.916 --> 00:18:26.586 A:middle
accessibility text sizes.

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.586 A:middle
And this year, in iOS 11, all

00:18:29.586 --> 00:18:31.116 A:middle
textiles will support these

00:18:31.116 --> 00:18:31.906 A:middle
larger settings.

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:34.306 A:middle
So, this means that we need to

00:18:34.306 --> 00:18:35.986 A:middle
design responsive layouts to be

00:18:35.986 --> 00:18:37.376 A:middle
able to handle these large font

00:18:37.376 --> 00:18:37.816 A:middle
sizes.

00:18:38.896 --> 00:18:40.806 A:middle
To do this for our own platform

00:18:40.966 --> 00:18:42.456 A:middle
apps this year, a team of us

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:44.066 A:middle
took a step back and developed a

00:18:44.066 --> 00:18:45.916 A:middle
few simple principles that

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:47.216 A:middle
helped guide us through a

00:18:47.216 --> 00:18:48.246 A:middle
system-wide audit.

00:18:49.556 --> 00:18:51.746 A:middle
The first principle was to make

00:18:51.746 --> 00:18:53.876 A:middle
as much text dynamic as possible

00:18:53.876 --> 00:18:54.836 A:middle
and to support these

00:18:54.836 --> 00:18:56.296 A:middle
accessibility text sizes.

00:18:57.646 --> 00:19:00.386 A:middle
Next is make good use of the

00:19:00.386 --> 00:19:02.436 A:middle
screen width by wrapping lines

00:19:02.436 --> 00:19:04.186 A:middle
of type, rather than truncating.

00:19:05.406 --> 00:19:07.316 A:middle
And then, displaying the same

00:19:07.316 --> 00:19:09.156 A:middle
amount of text at the larger

00:19:09.156 --> 00:19:11.066 A:middle
sizes as with the default UI.

00:19:12.456 --> 00:19:14.336 A:middle
And lastly, scaling glyphs that

00:19:14.336 --> 00:19:16.126 A:middle
appear next to text in content

00:19:16.126 --> 00:19:17.476 A:middle
areas so that the glyphs scale

00:19:17.476 --> 00:19:18.926 A:middle
with the text in harmony.

00:19:19.516 --> 00:19:21.486 A:middle
And when we look at all of these

00:19:21.486 --> 00:19:23.156 A:middle
together in practice it really

00:19:23.156 --> 00:19:23.916 A:middle
gets magical.

00:19:24.776 --> 00:19:27.106 A:middle
The mail screen now grows the

00:19:27.106 --> 00:19:29.206 A:middle
whole mail message to a zoom

00:19:29.206 --> 00:19:31.926 A:middle
level of 315% from the default

00:19:31.926 --> 00:19:32.366 A:middle
size.

00:19:33.456 --> 00:19:35.056 A:middle
And in custom layouts, like

00:19:35.056 --> 00:19:37.056 A:middle
calendar, this year we made even

00:19:37.056 --> 00:19:38.716 A:middle
more content scale like the

00:19:38.716 --> 00:19:40.596 A:middle
month grid increase in size,

00:19:41.106 --> 00:19:42.286 A:middle
where it didn't support dynamic

00:19:42.286 --> 00:19:43.216 A:middle
type it all before.

00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:45.826 A:middle
And at the larger accessibility

00:19:45.826 --> 00:19:48.126 A:middle
sizes, we re-laid out the event

00:19:48.286 --> 00:19:50.786 A:middle
row similar to the watch layout.

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:52.466 A:middle
Because in the end, the

00:19:52.466 --> 00:19:54.056 A:middle
character count per line was

00:19:54.056 --> 00:19:54.916 A:middle
about the same.

00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:57.416 A:middle
And it allowed maximum screen

00:19:57.416 --> 00:19:58.356 A:middle
width for text.

00:19:59.046 --> 00:20:01.526 A:middle
So, now if we turn on the bold

00:20:01.526 --> 00:20:04.256 A:middle
text setting and simulate low

00:20:04.256 --> 00:20:05.836 A:middle
vision with the blur, and

00:20:06.866 --> 00:20:08.666 A:middle
compare it next to the largest

00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:10.236 A:middle
currently shipping screen on the

00:20:10.236 --> 00:20:12.496 A:middle
left, now people with vision

00:20:12.496 --> 00:20:14.016 A:middle
loss will be able to use this

00:20:14.016 --> 00:20:14.386 A:middle
app more.

00:20:15.916 --> 00:20:16.726 A:middle
Thanks.

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:21.766 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:22.266 --> 00:20:23.526 A:middle
We've designed these responsive

00:20:23.526 --> 00:20:25.736 A:middle
layouts in most native UIKit

00:20:25.736 --> 00:20:26.426 A:middle
controls.

00:20:26.626 --> 00:20:28.356 A:middle
For example, like action sheets,

00:20:29.226 --> 00:20:31.286 A:middle
edit menus, and a keyboard auto

00:20:31.286 --> 00:20:32.046 A:middle
correction bar.

00:20:33.386 --> 00:20:34.736 A:middle
For elements like navigation

00:20:34.736 --> 00:20:36.386 A:middle
bars, toolbars, and tab bars

00:20:36.756 --> 00:20:37.796 A:middle
that would take up too much

00:20:37.796 --> 00:20:39.016 A:middle
space if we scaled them.

00:20:39.346 --> 00:20:41.086 A:middle
We added a larger representation

00:20:41.086 --> 00:20:42.776 A:middle
of the Fortis in a central hub

00:20:42.886 --> 00:20:44.616 A:middle
that you can get via Long Press.

00:20:45.936 --> 00:20:47.556 A:middle
And we also added larger

00:20:47.556 --> 00:20:49.796 A:middle
popovers for segmented controls.

00:20:50.446 --> 00:20:53.266 A:middle
And we've also extended larger

00:20:53.266 --> 00:20:55.026 A:middle
tech support to system spaces

00:20:55.026 --> 00:20:58.506 A:middle
like home screen app labels, and

00:20:58.506 --> 00:20:59.256 A:middle
notifications.

00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:01.696 A:middle
Now, there are a few we missed

00:21:01.696 --> 00:21:03.736 A:middle
this year, but we have plans for

00:21:03.736 --> 00:21:06.086 A:middle
more and if you support iKit,

00:21:06.086 --> 00:21:07.216 A:middle
you will get these updates for

00:21:07.216 --> 00:21:08.466 A:middle
free as we make them.

00:21:09.086 --> 00:21:12.236 A:middle
So, maximizing legibility and

00:21:12.236 --> 00:21:14.086 A:middle
providing scalable dynamic type

00:21:14.086 --> 00:21:16.246 A:middle
improves visual experience for

00:21:16.246 --> 00:21:16.756 A:middle
everyone.

00:21:18.076 --> 00:21:19.936 A:middle
And alongside text that is clear

00:21:19.936 --> 00:21:22.186 A:middle
and understandable, same applies

00:21:22.186 --> 00:21:23.576 A:middle
for media and games.

00:21:24.546 --> 00:21:26.516 A:middle
All dialogue should support

00:21:26.516 --> 00:21:28.636 A:middle
captions because captions

00:21:28.636 --> 00:21:30.286 A:middle
display what is being spoken,

00:21:30.496 --> 00:21:31.706 A:middle
which gives more access to

00:21:31.706 --> 00:21:33.126 A:middle
people, whether you have hearing

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:35.006 A:middle
loss, in a public setting, or

00:21:35.006 --> 00:21:35.986 A:middle
maybe even learning a new

00:21:35.986 --> 00:21:36.516 A:middle
language.

00:21:37.466 --> 00:21:39.076 A:middle
It's like trying to watch a

00:21:39.076 --> 00:21:40.926 A:middle
video or a game intro with the

00:21:40.926 --> 00:21:42.456 A:middle
volume turned all the way down,

00:21:42.906 --> 00:21:45.576 A:middle
or trying to read someone's lips

00:21:45.576 --> 00:21:46.756 A:middle
that aren't looking at you.

00:21:46.956 --> 00:21:49.446 A:middle
It feels like you only get about

00:21:49.446 --> 00:21:50.326 A:middle
half the story.

00:21:51.806 --> 00:21:53.986 A:middle
So, apps like Kitchen Stories

00:21:53.986 --> 00:21:55.626 A:middle
have added captions to all of

00:21:55.626 --> 00:21:57.736 A:middle
their cooking videos, which is

00:21:58.436 --> 00:21:58.556 A:middle
great.

00:21:59.076 --> 00:22:01.616 A:middle
OK so along with sight is sound.

00:22:03.246 --> 00:22:04.626 A:middle
You can ask yourself, are your

00:22:04.626 --> 00:22:05.636 A:middle
apps audible?

00:22:06.806 --> 00:22:08.856 A:middle
So, let's listen to a clip of

00:22:08.856 --> 00:22:10.896 A:middle
the intro design for Carlos V.

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:13.426 A:middle
video again and listen to the

00:22:13.426 --> 00:22:15.096 A:middle
significance of the audible cues

00:22:15.096 --> 00:22:17.646 A:middle
of the app along with VoiceOver

00:22:17.646 --> 00:22:19.326 A:middle
that he's using to navigate.

00:22:20.086 --> 00:22:21.756 A:middle
Now, VoiceOver is a built-in

00:22:21.756 --> 00:22:23.756 A:middle
screen reader that speaks the

00:22:23.756 --> 00:22:25.446 A:middle
content on screen for people who

00:22:25.446 --> 00:22:27.246 A:middle
may be blind or have low vision.

00:22:29.486 --> 00:22:30.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Messages.

00:22:30.796 --> 00:22:31.546 A:middle
ReverbNation.

00:22:32.566 --> 00:22:33.426 A:middle
Double tap to open.

00:22:33.936 --> 00:22:34.486 A:middle
Text field.

00:22:34.796 --> 00:22:35.306 A:middle
Dictate.

00:22:36.046 --> 00:22:38.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Album will be dropping

00:22:38.196 --> 00:22:41.686 A:middle
worldwide on April 14, 2017!

00:22:42.776 --> 00:22:45.616 A:middle
Follow our ReverbNation page.

00:22:46.576 --> 00:22:48.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Done. Successfully shared.

00:22:50.526 --> 00:22:53.016 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, we can hear VoiceOver

00:22:53.016 --> 00:22:54.586 A:middle
navigating the app.

00:22:54.586 --> 00:22:56.346 A:middle
The custom sounds of the apps

00:22:56.346 --> 00:22:58.986 A:middle
messaging feature, and dictation

00:22:58.986 --> 00:23:00.266 A:middle
to input the message.

00:23:00.926 --> 00:23:02.576 A:middle
Altogether, this creates an

00:23:02.576 --> 00:23:04.596 A:middle
experience that is accessible to

00:23:04.596 --> 00:23:05.146 A:middle
Carlos.

00:23:06.246 --> 00:23:08.406 A:middle
So, adding thoughtful sounds to

00:23:08.406 --> 00:23:10.866 A:middle
app interactions helps you know

00:23:10.866 --> 00:23:13.086 A:middle
where you are, what you've done,

00:23:13.126 --> 00:23:14.276 A:middle
what you can do.

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:15.606 A:middle
Plus, it's just delightful.

00:23:17.516 --> 00:23:19.796 A:middle
So, checking out VoiceOver in a

00:23:19.796 --> 00:23:22.546 A:middle
system is as easy as asking Siri

00:23:22.576 --> 00:23:24.286 A:middle
to turn VoiceOver on and off.

00:23:25.156 --> 00:23:26.316 A:middle
But if you don't know the

00:23:26.316 --> 00:23:27.966 A:middle
VoiceOver's like I have a quick

00:23:27.966 --> 00:23:28.486 A:middle
demo here.

00:23:29.036 --> 00:23:30.486 A:middle
I'll be swiping across the

00:23:30.486 --> 00:23:32.336 A:middle
screen to advance the selection

00:23:32.616 --> 00:23:33.326 A:middle
through some apps.

00:23:33.716 --> 00:23:34.996 A:middle
But then since I know that the

00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:36.546 A:middle
phone app is in my dock, I'm

00:23:36.586 --> 00:23:37.996 A:middle
going to tap the lower left hand

00:23:37.996 --> 00:23:39.376 A:middle
corner of the screen and then

00:23:39.376 --> 00:23:41.946 A:middle
double tap to open.

00:23:41.946 --> 00:23:42.756 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on.

00:23:42.846 --> 00:23:44.506 A:middle
Mail. No unread emails.

00:23:44.846 --> 00:23:46.946 A:middle
Calendar. Monday, June 5.

00:23:47.486 --> 00:23:49.046 A:middle
Photos. Camera.

00:23:50.006 --> 00:23:51.466 A:middle
Dock. Phone.

00:23:53.606 --> 00:23:54.816 A:middle
Phone. Add.

00:23:54.816 --> 00:23:55.476 A:middle
Favorites.

00:23:56.326 --> 00:23:58.086 A:middle
Edit button.

00:23:58.086 --> 00:23:59.816 A:middle
Amy Frost iPhone button.

00:24:01.166 --> 00:24:02.846 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, and there are tutorials

00:24:02.846 --> 00:24:04.406 A:middle
and documentation on Apple's

00:24:04.406 --> 00:24:05.906 A:middle
developer site to help you

00:24:05.906 --> 00:24:07.436 A:middle
become even more familiar and to

00:24:07.436 --> 00:24:08.726 A:middle
be able to support this in your

00:24:08.726 --> 00:24:09.000 A:middle
apps.

00:24:11.356 --> 00:24:12.316 A:middle
Additionally, if you have

00:24:12.316 --> 00:24:13.926 A:middle
image-based apps, we need to

00:24:13.926 --> 00:24:15.786 A:middle
allow image descriptions to be

00:24:15.786 --> 00:24:17.586 A:middle
added at share time by the

00:24:17.586 --> 00:24:19.646 A:middle
poster so that VoiceOver can

00:24:19.646 --> 00:24:21.556 A:middle
have something personalized to

00:24:21.556 --> 00:24:23.026 A:middle
describe the photo with.

00:24:23.546 --> 00:24:25.406 A:middle
Otherwise, new in VoiceOver this

00:24:25.406 --> 00:24:27.586 A:middle
year is image analysis to

00:24:27.586 --> 00:24:29.056 A:middle
describe the image contents or

00:24:29.056 --> 00:24:30.626 A:middle
composition, or if type is

00:24:30.626 --> 00:24:31.836 A:middle
overlaid on images.

00:24:32.316 --> 00:24:35.136 A:middle
But a handcrafted description

00:24:35.136 --> 00:24:36.296 A:middle
will always be preferred.

00:24:37.016 --> 00:24:38.736 A:middle
Twitter has done a great job at

00:24:38.736 --> 00:24:40.406 A:middle
adding image description options

00:24:40.406 --> 00:24:41.376 A:middle
to their Tweet sheets.

00:24:42.676 --> 00:24:45.156 A:middle
So, another area that reduces

00:24:45.156 --> 00:24:47.996 A:middle
hurdles and barriers for apps is

00:24:48.366 --> 00:24:49.846 A:middle
integrating with Siri.

00:24:50.046 --> 00:24:51.886 A:middle
Siri is the ultimate quick

00:24:51.886 --> 00:24:54.466 A:middle
access to your app that doesn't

00:24:54.466 --> 00:24:56.806 A:middle
even require looking or holding,

00:24:56.806 --> 00:24:58.106 A:middle
or touching the screen, with

00:24:58.106 --> 00:24:59.786 A:middle
this voice activation and speech

00:24:59.786 --> 00:25:00.166 A:middle
input.

00:25:00.786 --> 00:25:02.796 A:middle
It's hands-free and eyes free.

00:25:03.116 --> 00:25:04.926 A:middle
I can control my home, send

00:25:04.926 --> 00:25:06.526 A:middle
messages, and even start

00:25:06.526 --> 00:25:08.086 A:middle
workouts quickly with apps like

00:25:08.086 --> 00:25:08.516 A:middle
Zova.

00:25:09.656 --> 00:25:12.486 A:middle
And also, new this year is being

00:25:12.486 --> 00:25:14.336 A:middle
able to type to Siri that is

00:25:14.336 --> 00:25:16.246 A:middle
available in accessibility

00:25:16.246 --> 00:25:16.646 A:middle
settings.

00:25:17.106 --> 00:25:18.816 A:middle
This gives quick access to

00:25:18.816 --> 00:25:19.806 A:middle
someone who may not be able to

00:25:19.806 --> 00:25:20.316 A:middle
speak.

00:25:20.386 --> 00:25:21.896 A:middle
Or maybe you're just in a public

00:25:21.896 --> 00:25:22.336 A:middle
setting.

00:25:22.986 --> 00:25:26.716 A:middle
So, lastly, along with sight and

00:25:26.716 --> 00:25:28.156 A:middle
sound, is touch.

00:25:28.716 --> 00:25:31.026 A:middle
You can ask yourself, are your

00:25:31.026 --> 00:25:32.076 A:middle
apps tactile?

00:25:32.856 --> 00:25:34.366 A:middle
On supported devices adding

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:36.126 A:middle
haptics provides a way to

00:25:36.206 --> 00:25:37.936 A:middle
physically engage people through

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:38.456 A:middle
feel.

00:25:38.456 --> 00:25:41.036 A:middle
It gets your attention if sight

00:25:41.036 --> 00:25:42.366 A:middle
and sound are not an option.

00:25:42.716 --> 00:25:44.236 A:middle
But also, provides an

00:25:44.306 --> 00:25:45.676 A:middle
enhancement for everyone.

00:25:46.686 --> 00:25:48.876 A:middle
For example, some

00:25:48.876 --> 00:25:50.706 A:middle
system-provided interface

00:25:50.706 --> 00:25:52.056 A:middle
elements such as switches,

00:25:52.056 --> 00:25:54.036 A:middle
sliders, pickers, index

00:25:54.036 --> 00:25:55.936 A:middle
scrubbers provide haptic

00:25:55.936 --> 00:25:57.166 A:middle
feedback when we interact with

00:25:57.166 --> 00:25:59.196 A:middle
them to reinforce the action

00:25:59.356 --> 00:26:00.046 A:middle
that we're doing.

00:26:01.286 --> 00:26:06.726 A:middle
And a haptic on pull to refresh,

00:26:07.106 --> 00:26:08.316 A:middle
let's you know that you've

00:26:08.516 --> 00:26:10.356 A:middle
reached the critical threshold

00:26:10.626 --> 00:26:12.606 A:middle
between scrolling and refreshing

00:26:12.866 --> 00:26:14.256 A:middle
that shares a continuous

00:26:14.256 --> 00:26:14.736 A:middle
gesture.

00:26:16.086 --> 00:26:20.466 A:middle
And likewise, with swipe to

00:26:20.466 --> 00:26:20.916 A:middle
delete.

00:26:21.296 --> 00:26:22.856 A:middle
The haptic provides the critical

00:26:22.856 --> 00:26:24.876 A:middle
threshold of the accelerated

00:26:24.876 --> 00:26:27.076 A:middle
delete swipe.

00:26:27.546 --> 00:26:31.136 A:middle
And then another example is

00:26:31.136 --> 00:26:31.746 A:middle
Siri.

00:26:31.746 --> 00:26:34.356 A:middle
It uses a success haptic as a

00:26:34.356 --> 00:26:35.906 A:middle
confirmation that she heard what

00:26:35.906 --> 00:26:36.416 A:middle
you said.

00:26:42.726 --> 00:26:44.886 A:middle
Or Apple Pay uses visuals

00:26:44.886 --> 00:26:46.876 A:middle
haptics and sound with the

00:26:46.876 --> 00:26:49.756 A:middle
confirmation for the successful

00:26:49.756 --> 00:26:50.266 A:middle
purchase.

00:26:50.846 --> 00:26:52.406 A:middle
It feels the way it looks and

00:26:52.406 --> 00:26:53.716 A:middle
sounds, leaving me with a

00:26:53.716 --> 00:26:59.156 A:middle
confident purchase or payment

00:26:59.156 --> 00:26:59.223 A:middle
[ding].

00:26:59.223 --> 00:27:01.446 A:middle
Now, that's clear.

00:27:02.106 --> 00:27:04.706 A:middle
So, to see if your apps are

00:27:04.706 --> 00:27:07.236 A:middle
perceivable, ask yourself is it

00:27:07.236 --> 00:27:07.866 A:middle
legible?

00:27:08.336 --> 00:27:09.556 A:middle
Can I read it?

00:27:09.766 --> 00:27:10.696 A:middle
Is it audible?

00:27:10.696 --> 00:27:12.156 A:middle
Is it usable without site?

00:27:13.056 --> 00:27:14.096 A:middle
Is it tactile?

00:27:14.096 --> 00:27:14.946 A:middle
Can I feel it?

00:27:15.736 --> 00:27:17.386 A:middle
Take one away, or even two of

00:27:17.386 --> 00:27:20.646 A:middle
these can I still understand it.

00:27:21.366 --> 00:27:23.336 A:middle
And so, now my colleague AJ is

00:27:23.336 --> 00:27:24.726 A:middle
going to talk about what they

00:27:24.726 --> 00:27:26.366 A:middle
did in the Maps Team this year,

00:27:26.566 --> 00:27:27.896 A:middle
applying some of these methods.

00:27:29.516 --> 00:27:34.496 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:27:34.996 --> 00:27:37.226 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Caroline.

00:27:37.576 --> 00:27:38.316 A:middle
Good morning, everyone.

00:27:39.036 --> 00:27:41.856 A:middle
In Maps we collaborated closely

00:27:41.856 --> 00:27:43.096 A:middle
with Caroline and the platform

00:27:43.096 --> 00:27:43.496 A:middle
team.

00:27:43.946 --> 00:27:45.166 A:middle
And this year we put into

00:27:45.166 --> 00:27:46.716 A:middle
practice a lot of what she's

00:27:46.716 --> 00:27:47.206 A:middle
covered today.

00:27:48.036 --> 00:27:50.396 A:middle
Now, before we get into a few of

00:27:50.396 --> 00:27:52.806 A:middle
those examples, and think about

00:27:52.806 --> 00:27:54.416 A:middle
how to design with integrity,

00:27:54.866 --> 00:27:55.976 A:middle
we're going to take a short

00:27:55.976 --> 00:27:56.486 A:middle
diversion.

00:27:56.486 --> 00:27:58.356 A:middle
It's going to add a couple of

00:27:58.356 --> 00:28:03.086 A:middle
minutes to our ETA.

00:28:03.336 --> 00:28:04.826 A:middle
We've used maps for thousands of

00:28:04.826 --> 00:28:09.206 A:middle
years to plan, direct, to travel

00:28:09.406 --> 00:28:10.966 A:middle
and to help us explore the

00:28:10.966 --> 00:28:11.146 A:middle
world.

00:28:12.486 --> 00:28:14.496 A:middle
And maps of the past, like this

00:28:14.496 --> 00:28:16.856 A:middle
one, beautiful as they remain,

00:28:17.406 --> 00:28:19.376 A:middle
were not accessible at all.

00:28:20.056 --> 00:28:22.386 A:middle
You can't zoom on this map

00:28:22.816 --> 00:28:24.916 A:middle
without a magnifying glass, and

00:28:24.916 --> 00:28:26.076 A:middle
you couldn't orient yourself

00:28:26.076 --> 00:28:29.156 A:middle
upon it without a compass.

00:28:29.716 --> 00:28:32.536 A:middle
In face the only manipulating

00:28:32.536 --> 00:28:34.226 A:middle
you could do would be to fold

00:28:35.036 --> 00:28:35.106 A:middle
it.

00:28:35.756 --> 00:28:37.766 A:middle
So, as our understanding of the

00:28:37.766 --> 00:28:40.086 A:middle
world has improved, so have our

00:28:40.826 --> 00:28:40.956 A:middle
maps.

00:28:43.436 --> 00:28:45.696 A:middle
Today, your map understands

00:28:45.696 --> 00:28:46.486 A:middle
where you are.

00:28:47.296 --> 00:28:48.286 A:middle
It knows the direction you're

00:28:48.346 --> 00:28:48.626 A:middle
facing.

00:28:50.006 --> 00:28:50.916 A:middle
It knows the device you're

00:28:50.916 --> 00:28:53.076 A:middle
using, and it's equipped with

00:28:53.076 --> 00:28:54.226 A:middle
your individual preferences.

00:28:55.696 --> 00:28:57.676 A:middle
It's updated every day with new

00:28:57.676 --> 00:28:58.236 A:middle
information.

00:28:58.726 --> 00:28:59.626 A:middle
And you can search it.

00:29:00.836 --> 00:29:02.606 A:middle
You can mark it indestructibly

00:29:02.926 --> 00:29:03.716 A:middle
and make it your own.

00:29:04.496 --> 00:29:07.166 A:middle
It can take you places in real

00:29:07.166 --> 00:29:08.866 A:middle
time, avoiding traffic,

00:29:09.706 --> 00:29:10.236 A:middle
hopefully.

00:29:11.286 --> 00:29:13.446 A:middle
And in iOS 11, you can even see

00:29:13.446 --> 00:29:14.286 A:middle
inside venues.

00:29:14.936 --> 00:29:18.966 A:middle
The point is, today our mediums

00:29:19.116 --> 00:29:21.316 A:middle
are so versatile, they provide

00:29:21.316 --> 00:29:22.246 A:middle
us with the incredible

00:29:22.246 --> 00:29:22.866 A:middle
opportunity.

00:29:25.896 --> 00:29:28.336 A:middle
So, when I joined Maps, I

00:29:28.336 --> 00:29:29.606 A:middle
remember thinking a lot about

00:29:29.606 --> 00:29:32.236 A:middle
how crazy it felt to see inside.

00:29:32.996 --> 00:29:34.386 A:middle
Like looking through a keyhole

00:29:34.956 --> 00:29:37.866 A:middle
and stepping through this icon,

00:29:37.866 --> 00:29:39.526 A:middle
I cannot have imagined the

00:29:39.526 --> 00:29:40.806 A:middle
operation I saw behind it.

00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:43.116 A:middle
I took it almost completely for

00:29:43.116 --> 00:29:43.556 A:middle
granted.

00:29:45.056 --> 00:29:46.646 A:middle
And everyone who uses our apps

00:29:46.646 --> 00:29:47.306 A:middle
are the same way.

00:29:48.456 --> 00:29:49.726 A:middle
They don't care how hard it was

00:29:49.786 --> 00:29:50.176 A:middle
to build.

00:29:51.406 --> 00:29:52.746 A:middle
It's not important that it works

00:29:52.786 --> 00:29:54.846 A:middle
for Johnny Appleseed or Jane

00:29:54.846 --> 00:29:55.086 A:middle
Doe.

00:29:56.466 --> 00:29:57.766 A:middle
What's important is that it

00:29:57.766 --> 00:29:58.576 A:middle
works for me.

00:29:59.886 --> 00:30:00.506 A:middle
Can I use it?

00:30:02.246 --> 00:30:03.796 A:middle
Imagine going to the movies.

00:30:04.796 --> 00:30:06.016 A:middle
You bought your ticket and your

00:30:06.016 --> 00:30:07.266 A:middle
excited to watch the film.

00:30:08.116 --> 00:30:08.736 A:middle
The theater's packed.

00:30:09.926 --> 00:30:11.526 A:middle
You get to your seat and there's

00:30:11.526 --> 00:30:12.676 A:middle
a pillar in front of it,

00:30:13.236 --> 00:30:14.396 A:middle
completely blocking your view.

00:30:15.676 --> 00:30:16.986 A:middle
I'm pretty sure I'm not going to

00:30:16.986 --> 00:30:17.946 A:middle
come back to that cinema.

00:30:18.526 --> 00:30:21.886 A:middle
And I'm no longer just a regular

00:30:21.886 --> 00:30:23.816 A:middle
Maps user, not that there's any

00:30:23.816 --> 00:30:24.326 A:middle
such thing.

00:30:25.616 --> 00:30:27.516 A:middle
We're trying to build a map of

00:30:27.516 --> 00:30:30.026 A:middle
the entire world and it's a big

00:30:30.026 --> 00:30:32.356 A:middle
and diverse place.

00:30:32.536 --> 00:30:34.286 A:middle
Like you, I'm on a team

00:30:34.286 --> 00:30:36.056 A:middle
responsible for everyone's

00:30:36.056 --> 00:30:36.546 A:middle
experience.

00:30:37.266 --> 00:30:40.766 A:middle
So, coming back to simplicity

00:30:40.866 --> 00:30:41.866 A:middle
and perceivability.

00:30:43.216 --> 00:30:45.396 A:middle
Maps are not exact replicas of

00:30:45.396 --> 00:30:46.026 A:middle
environments.

00:30:47.136 --> 00:30:49.176 A:middle
Sometimes photographic detail is

00:30:49.176 --> 00:30:49.636 A:middle
useful.

00:30:50.516 --> 00:30:52.396 A:middle
But most people don't find the

00:30:52.396 --> 00:30:53.976 A:middle
satellite view practical in

00:30:53.976 --> 00:30:55.306 A:middle
everyday life.

00:30:56.516 --> 00:30:59.056 A:middle
We use simplified abstracted

00:30:59.056 --> 00:31:01.366 A:middle
representations, designed to be

00:31:01.366 --> 00:31:03.186 A:middle
easy to understand and faster

00:31:03.186 --> 00:31:06.566 A:middle
for us to process to help us

00:31:06.566 --> 00:31:07.936 A:middle
orient ourselves more quickly.

00:31:08.526 --> 00:31:10.456 A:middle
And it's why we provide a

00:31:10.456 --> 00:31:11.356 A:middle
transit map too.

00:31:11.356 --> 00:31:13.946 A:middle
Where we suppress some elements,

00:31:14.456 --> 00:31:16.196 A:middle
like places or minor roads,

00:31:16.586 --> 00:31:17.846 A:middle
which aren't as relevant to you

00:31:18.096 --> 00:31:19.146 A:middle
once you're using transit.

00:31:20.156 --> 00:31:21.256 A:middle
And we do all this for

00:31:21.256 --> 00:31:21.876 A:middle
simplicity.

00:31:22.436 --> 00:31:26.176 A:middle
And we make sure our maps are

00:31:26.176 --> 00:31:26.896 A:middle
understandable.

00:31:27.796 --> 00:31:30.026 A:middle
Visually, audibly, and through

00:31:30.026 --> 00:31:30.886 A:middle
haptic feedback.

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:33.556 A:middle
We put a lot of care into

00:31:33.556 --> 00:31:34.996 A:middle
keeping the navigation screen as

00:31:35.036 --> 00:31:35.956 A:middle
simple as possible.

00:31:36.496 --> 00:31:37.776 A:middle
The most important information

00:31:37.776 --> 00:31:39.346 A:middle
available at a glance.

00:31:39.396 --> 00:31:41.716 A:middle
So, you can understand quickly

00:31:42.116 --> 00:31:44.146 A:middle
and stay focused on the road.

00:31:44.706 --> 00:31:46.236 A:middle
And while you're walking or

00:31:46.236 --> 00:31:48.136 A:middle
taking transit, audible

00:31:48.136 --> 00:31:50.206 A:middle
directions spoken clearly.

00:31:51.076 --> 00:31:52.396 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Starting route to San Jose

00:31:52.396 --> 00:31:53.756 A:middle
McEnery Convention Center.

00:31:55.076 --> 00:31:56.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Imagine if Siri mumbled these

00:31:56.976 --> 00:31:59.106 A:middle
instructions incomprehensibly.

00:32:00.146 --> 00:32:01.526 A:middle
Because isn't that kind of the

00:32:01.526 --> 00:32:03.146 A:middle
equivalent to small, blurry

00:32:03.146 --> 00:32:03.706 A:middle
information.

00:32:04.296 --> 00:32:07.106 A:middle
And on your wrist, while your

00:32:07.106 --> 00:32:07.946 A:middle
phone is in your pocket,

00:32:08.416 --> 00:32:10.736 A:middle
different tactic sensations to

00:32:10.736 --> 00:32:13.366 A:middle
inform which way to turn and

00:32:14.216 --> 00:32:14.336 A:middle
when.

00:32:14.536 --> 00:32:16.336 A:middle
Altogether for perceivability.

00:32:17.156 --> 00:32:18.976 A:middle
It's legible, audible, and

00:32:19.216 --> 00:32:19.546 A:middle
tactile.

00:32:20.016 --> 00:32:23.316 A:middle
And you can use any one of these

00:32:24.586 --> 00:32:24.986 A:middle
distinctly.

00:32:24.986 --> 00:32:26.376 A:middle
Integrity is something different

00:32:26.376 --> 00:32:26.966 A:middle
conceptually.

00:32:27.796 --> 00:32:30.226 A:middle
We do things for simplicity and

00:32:30.226 --> 00:32:31.516 A:middle
to improve perceivability.

00:32:32.276 --> 00:32:34.036 A:middle
But we do things with integrity.

00:32:35.126 --> 00:32:36.676 A:middle
The state of being whole and

00:32:36.676 --> 00:32:37.196 A:middle
undivided.

00:32:39.216 --> 00:32:40.406 A:middle
When we say someone has

00:32:40.406 --> 00:32:42.056 A:middle
integrity with think of them as

00:32:42.056 --> 00:32:44.186 A:middle
being honest with an admirable

00:32:44.186 --> 00:32:45.026 A:middle
moral compass.

00:32:45.956 --> 00:32:47.066 A:middle
So, when we consider that the

00:32:47.066 --> 00:32:48.496 A:middle
people who need our services the

00:32:48.496 --> 00:32:50.546 A:middle
most, might be the ones who find

00:32:50.546 --> 00:32:52.846 A:middle
them the hardest to use, how do

00:32:52.846 --> 00:32:53.876 A:middle
we design with integrity.

00:32:55.446 --> 00:32:57.536 A:middle
Well, as designers and

00:32:57.536 --> 00:32:58.316 A:middle
developers, we take

00:32:58.316 --> 00:32:59.096 A:middle
responsibility.

00:33:00.446 --> 00:33:03.326 A:middle
When architects build spaces

00:33:03.326 --> 00:33:05.246 A:middle
today, they make sure they're

00:33:05.246 --> 00:33:07.356 A:middle
accessible for everyone because

00:33:07.356 --> 00:33:08.476 A:middle
it's a human right.

00:33:08.846 --> 00:33:10.586 A:middle
And when designer draw beautiful

00:33:10.586 --> 00:33:12.826 A:middle
cars, they still have to adhere

00:33:12.946 --> 00:33:15.506 A:middle
to regulations created for human

00:33:16.156 --> 00:33:16.316 A:middle
safety.

00:33:17.176 --> 00:33:18.566 A:middle
So, when we design digital

00:33:18.566 --> 00:33:20.716 A:middle
products, we have to hold

00:33:20.716 --> 00:33:21.966 A:middle
ourselves accountable for their

00:33:21.966 --> 00:33:23.146 A:middle
accessibility too.

00:33:23.666 --> 00:33:24.646 A:middle
Because when we don't we're

00:33:24.646 --> 00:33:25.676 A:middle
deciding who's important.

00:33:26.256 --> 00:33:30.326 A:middle
Last year for iOS 10, we

00:33:30.326 --> 00:33:31.926 A:middle
redesigned Maps from the ground

00:33:31.926 --> 00:33:32.436 A:middle
up.

00:33:33.616 --> 00:33:36.196 A:middle
Making it clearer, simpler, easy

00:33:36.196 --> 00:33:36.816 A:middle
to use, and faster.

00:33:37.216 --> 00:33:39.466 A:middle
And it was a big undertaking.

00:33:40.526 --> 00:33:41.456 A:middle
We opened the door on

00:33:41.536 --> 00:33:43.216 A:middle
accessibility, but we didn't go

00:33:43.216 --> 00:33:44.266 A:middle
that far along the corridor.

00:33:44.266 --> 00:33:45.866 A:middle
It was a busy year.

00:33:47.686 --> 00:33:49.226 A:middle
But in iOS 11 we did take

00:33:49.226 --> 00:33:51.276 A:middle
responsibility, and we made it a

00:33:51.326 --> 00:33:54.226 A:middle
priority, leveraging the new

00:33:54.226 --> 00:33:55.916 A:middle
UIKit frameworks and following

00:33:55.916 --> 00:33:57.326 A:middle
the principles that Caroline

00:33:57.326 --> 00:33:59.546 A:middle
outlined today.

00:33:59.736 --> 00:34:01.316 A:middle
Making as much text dynamic as

00:34:01.346 --> 00:34:03.776 A:middle
possible, displaying the same

00:34:03.776 --> 00:34:05.366 A:middle
amount of text as the default

00:34:05.366 --> 00:34:09.226 A:middle
UI, using as much of the screen

00:34:09.226 --> 00:34:11.696 A:middle
width for text.

00:34:11.696 --> 00:34:12.746 A:middle
Search is a core component of

00:34:12.746 --> 00:34:14.796 A:middle
Maps and now it's easier for

00:34:14.796 --> 00:34:15.476 A:middle
everyone to use.

00:34:16.106 --> 00:34:18.486 A:middle
But it's not always just as

00:34:18.516 --> 00:34:20.096 A:middle
simple as increasing the font

00:34:20.096 --> 00:34:20.316 A:middle
size.

00:34:21.106 --> 00:34:22.216 A:middle
And you might be thinking, hang

00:34:22.216 --> 00:34:24.166 A:middle
on, I can see some truncation in

00:34:24.166 --> 00:34:24.876 A:middle
these screenshots.

00:34:25.676 --> 00:34:26.846 A:middle
This breaks the principles we're

00:34:26.846 --> 00:34:28.466 A:middle
talking about, and you're right.

00:34:29.206 --> 00:34:30.456 A:middle
But sometimes we have to make

00:34:30.456 --> 00:34:32.126 A:middle
choices based on context.

00:34:33.196 --> 00:34:34.526 A:middle
Like, on the right screen here

00:34:34.526 --> 00:34:36.036 A:middle
the top of the card has a fixed

00:34:36.036 --> 00:34:36.316 A:middle
header.

00:34:37.036 --> 00:34:38.566 A:middle
So, if we didn't truncate, the

00:34:38.566 --> 00:34:40.296 A:middle
route options beneath would not

00:34:40.296 --> 00:34:40.906 A:middle
be scrollable.

00:34:41.666 --> 00:34:45.906 A:middle
Now, this is the card for a

00:34:45.906 --> 00:34:46.176 A:middle
place.

00:34:47.086 --> 00:34:47.806 A:middle
They're used in different

00:34:47.806 --> 00:34:50.516 A:middle
context across iOS, including

00:34:50.766 --> 00:34:53.046 A:middle
Spotlight, Safari, and Siri.

00:34:53.706 --> 00:34:55.376 A:middle
And from here you start

00:34:55.376 --> 00:34:58.106 A:middle
navigation, make a call to check

00:34:58.106 --> 00:34:58.996 A:middle
on your reservation.

00:34:59.926 --> 00:35:00.986 A:middle
Or even have a look at what's

00:35:00.986 --> 00:35:01.396 A:middle
inside.

00:35:02.156 --> 00:35:03.546 A:middle
Things everyone might like to

00:35:03.546 --> 00:35:03.660 A:middle
do.

00:35:05.136 --> 00:35:07.196 A:middle
So, let's take a closer look at

00:35:07.196 --> 00:35:08.306 A:middle
some of the components of this

00:35:08.386 --> 00:35:10.576 A:middle
design, like the title block.

00:35:10.576 --> 00:35:15.436 A:middle
We use this with search results

00:35:15.436 --> 00:35:18.106 A:middle
too and last year we truncated

00:35:18.106 --> 00:35:20.226 A:middle
the title for long place names

00:35:20.566 --> 00:35:21.436 A:middle
instead of wrapping.

00:35:22.556 --> 00:35:24.206 A:middle
But with a big of UIKit magic,

00:35:24.376 --> 00:35:28.336 A:middle
this year, now it does this.

00:35:28.546 --> 00:35:29.556 A:middle
Which is actually pretty cool.

00:35:29.556 --> 00:35:32.386 A:middle
And the component is more

00:35:32.386 --> 00:35:34.226 A:middle
effective and robust because of

00:35:34.856 --> 00:35:35.000 A:middle
it.

00:35:36.046 --> 00:35:37.126 A:middle
And we made some changes to the

00:35:37.126 --> 00:35:38.516 A:middle
place card this year to improve

00:35:38.516 --> 00:35:40.336 A:middle
hierarchy including this

00:35:40.336 --> 00:35:41.836 A:middle
secondary row of actions.

00:35:41.836 --> 00:35:44.336 A:middle
And we need to accommodate a

00:35:44.336 --> 00:35:45.996 A:middle
maximum of five options here.

00:35:47.006 --> 00:35:47.466 A:middle
Like these.

00:35:47.966 --> 00:35:50.196 A:middle
So, on an iPhone 7, in English,

00:35:51.646 --> 00:35:52.146 A:middle
hang on a sec.

00:35:53.736 --> 00:35:57.116 A:middle
That was such a cheap joke.

00:35:57.536 --> 00:36:00.686 A:middle
On iPhone 7, in English this

00:36:00.686 --> 00:36:02.336 A:middle
works and we can fit five in a

00:36:02.336 --> 00:36:02.403 A:middle
row.

00:36:02.403 --> 00:36:04.396 A:middle
But how do we handle it with

00:36:04.396 --> 00:36:05.056 A:middle
dynamic type?

00:36:05.266 --> 00:36:06.376 A:middle
Because we can't just increase

00:36:06.436 --> 00:36:07.106 A:middle
the font size.

00:36:07.246 --> 00:36:10.826 A:middle
But we could stack the UI

00:36:10.826 --> 00:36:12.006 A:middle
elements smartly.

00:36:12.006 --> 00:36:16.726 A:middle
And all the way up the scale.

00:36:17.416 --> 00:36:18.946 A:middle
Internationalization is a form

00:36:19.116 --> 00:36:20.186 A:middle
of accessibility too.

00:36:20.576 --> 00:36:21.366 A:middle
And it brings its own

00:36:21.366 --> 00:36:21.876 A:middle
challenges.

00:36:22.566 --> 00:36:23.986 A:middle
So, how about these labels in

00:36:23.986 --> 00:36:24.396 A:middle
Italian.

00:36:25.136 --> 00:36:27.716 A:middle
OK, they're a bit longer.

00:36:27.716 --> 00:36:31.036 A:middle
So, if we go back down to

00:36:31.876 --> 00:36:34.076 A:middle
default size, oh, but the label

00:36:34.076 --> 00:36:34.776 A:middle
is truncating.

00:36:34.866 --> 00:36:37.106 A:middle
And the label is important.

00:36:37.756 --> 00:36:39.446 A:middle
We should try not to truncate it

00:36:39.446 --> 00:36:40.026 A:middle
at any size.

00:36:40.026 --> 00:36:42.396 A:middle
But we could apply a similar

00:36:42.396 --> 00:36:45.256 A:middle
technique like this.

00:36:45.956 --> 00:36:48.126 A:middle
And now, they remain clear and

00:36:48.126 --> 00:36:48.796 A:middle
uncompromised.

00:36:50.276 --> 00:36:52.396 A:middle
Adaptive design based on a

00:36:52.396 --> 00:36:54.466 A:middle
user's language and UI settings.

00:36:55.186 --> 00:36:57.636 A:middle
And now it works better across

00:36:57.706 --> 00:36:58.956 A:middle
different device sizes too.

00:37:02.146 --> 00:37:03.256 A:middle
And for these actions at the

00:37:03.256 --> 00:37:05.166 A:middle
bottom of the card, as well as

00:37:05.166 --> 00:37:08.286 A:middle
all of the content, we reflowed

00:37:08.286 --> 00:37:13.276 A:middle
the labels and scaled the icons.

00:37:13.416 --> 00:37:15.206 A:middle
Using vector assets, so there's

00:37:15.206 --> 00:37:15.976 A:middle
no pixilation.

00:37:15.976 --> 00:37:18.326 A:middle
And of course, we made all the

00:37:18.326 --> 00:37:19.576 A:middle
labels VoiceOver enabled.

00:37:20.116 --> 00:37:21.586 A:middle
And in Maps, we hung out with

00:37:21.586 --> 00:37:22.186 A:middle
Siri as well.

00:37:22.806 --> 00:37:26.086 A:middle
So, there are more complex

00:37:26.086 --> 00:37:27.226 A:middle
challenges than the ones I just

00:37:27.226 --> 00:37:27.806 A:middle
illustrated.

00:37:28.626 --> 00:37:30.176 A:middle
And it's easier not to take

00:37:30.176 --> 00:37:30.926 A:middle
responsibility.

00:37:32.386 --> 00:37:33.766 A:middle
But challenges are rewarding.

00:37:34.776 --> 00:37:37.726 A:middle
And that's how I ended up;

00:37:38.006 --> 00:37:39.916 A:middle
challenges are fun and

00:37:39.916 --> 00:37:40.556 A:middle
rewarding.

00:37:40.556 --> 00:37:41.456 A:middle
And that's why I ended up

00:37:41.456 --> 00:37:42.996 A:middle
standing here today.

00:37:43.326 --> 00:37:44.426 A:middle
Designing for everyone is a

00:37:44.426 --> 00:37:46.336 A:middle
process that can bring a deeper

00:37:46.336 --> 00:37:49.056 A:middle
understanding of your product

00:37:49.706 --> 00:37:52.986 A:middle
and its purpose.

00:37:53.146 --> 00:37:54.796 A:middle
One of the few effective keys to

00:37:54.796 --> 00:37:55.716 A:middle
the design problem.

00:37:56.886 --> 00:37:58.616 A:middle
The ability of the designer to

00:37:58.616 --> 00:37:59.886 A:middle
recognize as many of the

00:37:59.886 --> 00:38:02.416 A:middle
constraints possible, their

00:38:02.416 --> 00:38:04.096 A:middle
willingness and enthusiasm for

00:38:04.336 --> 00:38:05.156 A:middle
working within these

00:38:05.156 --> 00:38:05.736 A:middle
constraints.

00:38:06.186 --> 00:38:09.496 A:middle
Because out of constraints come

00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:10.336 A:middle
great solutions.

00:38:10.856 --> 00:38:11.976 A:middle
And if we're designing just for

00:38:11.976 --> 00:38:14.156 A:middle
default settings, we're not

00:38:14.156 --> 00:38:14.906 A:middle
doing it right.

00:38:16.186 --> 00:38:17.266 A:middle
By trying to do better than

00:38:17.266 --> 00:38:19.226 A:middle
that, we make ourselves better.

00:38:20.036 --> 00:38:21.696 A:middle
And we really learned an awful

00:38:21.696 --> 00:38:22.000 A:middle
lot this year.

00:38:24.076 --> 00:38:26.686 A:middle
So, secondly after we decide to

00:38:26.686 --> 00:38:29.426 A:middle
take responsibility, we need to

00:38:29.426 --> 00:38:30.356 A:middle
think about empathy.

00:38:31.356 --> 00:38:32.796 A:middle
The ability to understand

00:38:32.796 --> 00:38:33.066 A:middle
people.

00:38:34.116 --> 00:38:35.746 A:middle
To recognize their wants,

00:38:36.116 --> 00:38:37.566 A:middle
desires, and feelings.

00:38:38.776 --> 00:38:40.456 A:middle
People that are not you --

00:38:41.286 --> 00:38:43.266 A:middle
because nobody else is.

00:38:43.336 --> 00:38:45.956 A:middle
So, let's take a look at a few

00:38:45.956 --> 00:38:48.396 A:middle
made-up examples that might be

00:38:48.396 --> 00:38:51.396 A:middle
closer to home.

00:38:51.616 --> 00:38:52.196 A:middle
Newspapers.

00:38:53.256 --> 00:38:54.616 A:middle
Never been accessible.

00:38:56.506 --> 00:38:57.306 A:middle
There's something nice to

00:38:57.306 --> 00:38:58.456 A:middle
sitting down with a newspaper,

00:38:58.456 --> 00:39:01.606 A:middle
but not if you can't read it.

00:39:02.736 --> 00:39:04.686 A:middle
If your vision isn't perfect,

00:39:04.686 --> 00:39:06.296 A:middle
reading one of these has always

00:39:06.296 --> 00:39:06.916 A:middle
been a challenge.

00:39:08.076 --> 00:39:09.116 A:middle
And a lot of you create

00:39:09.116 --> 00:39:10.386 A:middle
platforms for content that's

00:39:10.386 --> 00:39:12.746 A:middle
consumed the world over.

00:39:13.796 --> 00:39:15.816 A:middle
Platforms with the capabilities

00:39:16.886 --> 00:39:18.296 A:middle
to improve the readability of

00:39:18.296 --> 00:39:20.626 A:middle
our content, relatively and

00:39:20.626 --> 00:39:21.256 A:middle
automatically.

00:39:22.696 --> 00:39:24.016 A:middle
And platforms, which can be

00:39:24.016 --> 00:39:25.946 A:middle
navigated and understood through

00:39:25.946 --> 00:39:27.836 A:middle
sound for those who can't read

00:39:27.836 --> 00:39:28.236 A:middle
visually.

00:39:28.856 --> 00:39:32.576 A:middle
And we read a lot on our iPhones

00:39:32.766 --> 00:39:33.276 A:middle
or iPads.

00:39:33.996 --> 00:39:36.026 A:middle
Sometimes it's good news, other

00:39:36.026 --> 00:39:36.976 A:middle
times it's bad news.

00:39:37.666 --> 00:39:39.126 A:middle
Or, depending on where you look,

00:39:39.266 --> 00:39:42.946 A:middle
it could be fake news, like

00:39:42.946 --> 00:39:44.276 A:middle
these revelations about Lorem

00:39:44.276 --> 00:39:44.736 A:middle
ipsum.

00:39:47.926 --> 00:39:50.286 A:middle
So, here's the same article with

00:39:50.286 --> 00:39:51.776 A:middle
some visual considerations for

00:39:51.776 --> 00:39:52.756 A:middle
dynamic type.

00:39:53.856 --> 00:39:55.546 A:middle
The headline is moved outside

00:39:55.546 --> 00:39:57.176 A:middle
the hero image for better

00:39:57.176 --> 00:39:58.956 A:middle
contrast and for practicality.

00:40:00.046 --> 00:40:01.736 A:middle
And the content is readable at

00:40:01.736 --> 00:40:02.706 A:middle
my preferred size.

00:40:03.486 --> 00:40:05.226 A:middle
And it still looks great.

00:40:05.916 --> 00:40:07.526 A:middle
But what if you couldn't read a

00:40:07.526 --> 00:40:08.026 A:middle
price tag?

00:40:08.026 --> 00:40:10.296 A:middle
What would the experience of

00:40:10.356 --> 00:40:11.216 A:middle
buying things be like?

00:40:11.326 --> 00:40:14.676 A:middle
You can't tap on a price tag to

00:40:14.676 --> 00:40:17.646 A:middle
hear an audio cue, but on an

00:40:17.646 --> 00:40:19.866 A:middle
iPhone, iPad, or Mac you can do

00:40:19.866 --> 00:40:22.556 A:middle
exactly that and more.

00:40:22.796 --> 00:40:24.486 A:middle
So, here we are shopping for

00:40:24.596 --> 00:40:27.076 A:middle
fresh, delicious, emoji-fied

00:40:27.176 --> 00:40:27.686 A:middle
fruit.

00:40:28.666 --> 00:40:30.736 A:middle
And there's a two-column layout

00:40:30.736 --> 00:40:31.626 A:middle
at default settings.

00:40:32.126 --> 00:40:33.476 A:middle
So, if we turn up dynamic types

00:40:33.476 --> 00:40:36.096 A:middle
a bit, we could reflow the

00:40:36.096 --> 00:40:37.536 A:middle
content into one linear list.

00:40:38.966 --> 00:40:40.376 A:middle
Similar to how you would on a

00:40:40.376 --> 00:40:41.976 A:middle
responsive website between

00:40:41.976 --> 00:40:43.576 A:middle
desktop and mobile breakpoints.

00:40:44.446 --> 00:40:45.856 A:middle
Giving enough space to elements

00:40:46.186 --> 00:40:47.876 A:middle
to make them simpler and easier

00:40:48.736 --> 00:40:49.906 A:middle
to pass.

00:40:50.116 --> 00:40:51.256 A:middle
And here's our product page for

00:40:51.256 --> 00:40:51.886 A:middle
this pineapple.

00:40:53.946 --> 00:40:54.926 A:middle
Adapting your layout

00:40:54.926 --> 00:40:56.736 A:middle
appropriately makes sure the

00:40:56.736 --> 00:40:57.986 A:middle
most important actions are

00:40:57.986 --> 00:40:58.926 A:middle
available immediately.

00:40:59.906 --> 00:41:00.976 A:middle
So, again if we bump up the

00:41:00.976 --> 00:41:04.146 A:middle
dynamic type that's working

00:41:04.146 --> 00:41:04.536 A:middle
pretty well.

00:41:05.376 --> 00:41:06.846 A:middle
But, let's turn it up to the

00:41:06.846 --> 00:41:07.406 A:middle
maximum.

00:41:08.106 --> 00:41:11.336 A:middle
Nice, but is there more we can

00:41:11.336 --> 00:41:11.676 A:middle
do here?

00:41:12.576 --> 00:41:14.996 A:middle
If we scroll the card, we can

00:41:14.996 --> 00:41:17.326 A:middle
see the most desired actions are

00:41:17.326 --> 00:41:18.196 A:middle
a little bit far way.

00:41:19.016 --> 00:41:20.916 A:middle
So, maybe we'd consider swapping

00:41:20.916 --> 00:41:21.936 A:middle
them in this context.

00:41:22.706 --> 00:41:25.206 A:middle
Yes. And that's definitely

00:41:25.886 --> 00:41:26.016 A:middle
better.

00:41:26.976 --> 00:41:28.166 A:middle
Well, what about music,

00:41:29.116 --> 00:41:31.476 A:middle
podcasts, stories, sound?

00:41:32.826 --> 00:41:34.256 A:middle
Audio content is great because

00:41:34.256 --> 00:41:35.596 A:middle
it plays over the air, or your

00:41:35.596 --> 00:41:36.046 A:middle
headphones.

00:41:36.686 --> 00:41:37.776 A:middle
You don't need a UI to be

00:41:37.776 --> 00:41:38.636 A:middle
entertained by it.

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:40.736 A:middle
But you do need a UI to be able

00:41:40.736 --> 00:41:42.186 A:middle
to discover it.

00:41:43.376 --> 00:41:45.076 A:middle
And in the new podcast and music

00:41:45.076 --> 00:41:47.086 A:middle
apps on iOS 11, the content

00:41:47.086 --> 00:41:48.686 A:middle
adapts to your preferences and

00:41:48.686 --> 00:41:50.246 A:middle
can be used with VoiceOver, so

00:41:50.246 --> 00:41:51.766 A:middle
everyone can access it.

00:41:52.396 --> 00:41:56.096 A:middle
Now, finally potential energy.

00:41:56.546 --> 00:41:57.586 A:middle
Unlocking potential.

00:41:58.236 --> 00:42:00.856 A:middle
If we make more things possible

00:42:01.316 --> 00:42:03.306 A:middle
for more types of people, more

00:42:03.306 --> 00:42:03.936 A:middle
things can happen.

00:42:05.146 --> 00:42:07.116 A:middle
Awesome things like iconic

00:42:07.176 --> 00:42:09.016 A:middle
albums or pioneering science.

00:42:10.006 --> 00:42:11.376 A:middle
Or miraculous things like

00:42:11.566 --> 00:42:13.646 A:middle
remembering your friends'

00:42:14.736 --> 00:42:14.946 A:middle
birthdays.

00:42:15.086 --> 00:42:16.526 A:middle
Simple things like sending a

00:42:16.526 --> 00:42:18.246 A:middle
gift or a message to a loved

00:42:18.866 --> 00:42:18.976 A:middle
one.

00:42:20.716 --> 00:42:21.886 A:middle
Can anyone read that?

00:42:24.386 --> 00:42:26.616 A:middle
We're reliant on language and

00:42:26.616 --> 00:42:29.306 A:middle
our remarkable use of it is

00:42:29.306 --> 00:42:30.696 A:middle
perhaps the primary reason for

00:42:30.696 --> 00:42:32.056 A:middle
our success as a species.

00:42:32.946 --> 00:42:34.576 A:middle
Be it through colors, text,

00:42:35.196 --> 00:42:36.566 A:middle
sound, or signs.

00:42:37.296 --> 00:42:40.276 A:middle
And what about now?

00:42:41.286 --> 00:42:42.586 A:middle
German speakers in the room are

00:42:42.586 --> 00:42:43.796 A:middle
one step ahead of us.

00:42:44.836 --> 00:42:45.886 A:middle
If we don't communicate in

00:42:45.886 --> 00:42:48.176 A:middle
everyone's language, how can we

00:42:48.176 --> 00:42:49.986 A:middle
help them accomplish things?

00:42:51.096 --> 00:42:53.336 A:middle
Without understanding, we can't

00:42:53.336 --> 00:42:54.436 A:middle
create any value at all.

00:42:54.506 --> 00:42:58.686 A:middle
I read an amazing article

00:42:58.686 --> 00:43:00.776 A:middle
earlier this week called, "The

00:43:00.836 --> 00:43:02.896 A:middle
Thoughts of a Spider Web" by

00:43:02.896 --> 00:43:03.756 A:middle
Joshua Sokol.

00:43:04.936 --> 00:43:06.366 A:middle
And in it there was an example

00:43:07.056 --> 00:43:09.486 A:middle
about how bees use ultraviolet

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:11.806 A:middle
vision to find flowers that have

00:43:11.806 --> 00:43:13.406 A:middle
also evolved ultraviolet

00:43:13.406 --> 00:43:13.836 A:middle
markings.

00:43:15.186 --> 00:43:16.426 A:middle
And beside it a quote which

00:43:16.456 --> 00:43:19.106 A:middle
said, "if you don't have those

00:43:19.106 --> 00:43:21.736 A:middle
receptors that part of the world

00:43:21.736 --> 00:43:23.526 A:middle
simply doesn't exist."

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:27.626 A:middle
Design that includes everyone is

00:43:27.626 --> 00:43:30.206 A:middle
not good design, it's great

00:43:30.946 --> 00:43:31.096 A:middle
design.

00:43:32.116 --> 00:43:33.616 A:middle
So, design with integrity.

00:43:34.216 --> 00:43:36.056 A:middle
Take responsibility, caring

00:43:36.056 --> 00:43:38.156 A:middle
about everyone's experience, not

00:43:38.156 --> 00:43:38.696 A:middle
just your own.

00:43:39.886 --> 00:43:41.826 A:middle
And be empathetic considering

00:43:41.826 --> 00:43:43.676 A:middle
the perspectives of others who

00:43:43.676 --> 00:43:44.906 A:middle
interact with the world in

00:43:44.906 --> 00:43:46.676 A:middle
different ways than you do.

00:43:47.306 --> 00:43:49.436 A:middle
And understand that by doing so

00:43:49.436 --> 00:43:51.856 A:middle
we can help unlock potential, in

00:43:51.856 --> 00:43:53.276 A:middle
tiny and huge ways.

00:43:56.516 --> 00:44:01.846 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:44:02.346 --> 00:44:04.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, together we can strive

00:44:04.776 --> 00:44:06.486 A:middle
for simplicity and

00:44:06.486 --> 00:44:08.116 A:middle
perceivability in our apps.

00:44:08.296 --> 00:44:10.126 A:middle
And do it all with integrity for

00:44:10.126 --> 00:44:11.676 A:middle
making good apps great.

00:44:13.076 --> 00:44:14.896 A:middle
I encourage you to start now.

00:44:15.136 --> 00:44:17.026 A:middle
Go home and audit your apps.

00:44:17.216 --> 00:44:18.676 A:middle
Start conversations with your

00:44:18.676 --> 00:44:20.446 A:middle
team and people who use your

00:44:20.446 --> 00:44:20.906 A:middle
apps.

00:44:21.546 --> 00:44:22.986 A:middle
And most importantly schedule

00:44:22.986 --> 00:44:24.676 A:middle
time to see it all the way into

00:44:24.676 --> 00:44:25.596 A:middle
customers' hands.

00:44:26.666 --> 00:44:28.676 A:middle
And lastly do it proudly.

00:44:29.076 --> 00:44:31.346 A:middle
We can give everyone the chance

00:44:31.346 --> 00:44:33.406 A:middle
to be surprised, delighted, feel

00:44:33.406 --> 00:44:34.466 A:middle
good, and empowered.

00:44:35.366 --> 00:44:37.396 A:middle
We especially as designers would

00:44:37.396 --> 00:44:39.176 A:middle
always like things to line up

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:40.916 A:middle
just right, but you can't

00:44:40.916 --> 00:44:42.206 A:middle
control every line break.

00:44:42.836 --> 00:44:44.566 A:middle
You can't control how someone

00:44:44.566 --> 00:44:45.796 A:middle
will need to personalize their

00:44:45.796 --> 00:44:47.706 A:middle
experience because everyone is

00:44:47.706 --> 00:44:48.136 A:middle
different.

00:44:48.136 --> 00:44:50.186 A:middle
And let's celebrate that.

00:44:52.516 --> 00:44:53.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We're really proud of what

00:44:53.716 --> 00:44:54.736 A:middle
we've achieved in Maps this

00:44:54.736 --> 00:44:57.056 A:middle
year, but there's more to do and

00:44:57.056 --> 00:44:57.806 A:middle
we're going to keep going,

00:44:58.026 --> 00:44:59.886 A:middle
because a map is never finished.

00:45:00.996 --> 00:45:02.086 A:middle
And everyone wants to find their

00:45:02.086 --> 00:45:02.296 A:middle
way.

00:45:02.696 --> 00:45:03.916 A:middle
So, we're designing for everyone

00:45:04.006 --> 00:45:05.046 A:middle
and we really hope you'll join

00:45:05.046 --> 00:45:06.386 A:middle
us on this mission.
