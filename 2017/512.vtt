We are thrilled to be with you

Creating and Launching Your Own

Show.

00:01:07.986 --> 00:01:10.856 A:middle
But first, we want to talk for a

00:01:10.856 --> 00:01:12.686 A:middle
moment about how we think about

00:01:12.686 --> 00:01:16.146 A:middle
modern podcasts, long form and

00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:16.656 A:middle
audio.

00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:19.756 A:middle
We get excited about episodic

00:01:19.756 --> 00:01:21.636 A:middle
content that entertains,

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.676 A:middle
informs, and inspires.

00:01:25.136 --> 00:01:26.416 A:middle
We get excited in that many of

00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:27.956 A:middle
our users have gotten excited

00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:28.366 A:middle
too.

00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:32.036 A:middle
In 2016 alone, we served up over

00:01:32.136 --> 00:01:34.786 A:middle
10 billion episode downloads and

00:01:34.786 --> 00:01:37.246 A:middle
streaming plays across iOS,

00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.196 A:middle
macOS and tvOS.

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:42.976 A:middle
That's up from 8 billion in 2015

00:01:42.976 --> 00:01:45.906 A:middle
and just under 7 billion in 2014

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:47.956 A:middle
when Podcasts app became

00:01:48.206 --> 00:01:49.886 A:middle
preinstalled for the first time

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:50.656 A:middle
on iOS 8.

00:01:51.246 --> 00:01:54.406 A:middle
2017 is shaping up to be another

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:56.586 A:middle
banner year as new listeners

00:01:56.586 --> 00:01:58.156 A:middle
discover podcasts and the great

00:01:58.156 --> 00:01:59.646 A:middle
content inside the catalog.

00:02:00.226 --> 00:02:01.426 A:middle
We're on track for more than 20

00:02:01.426 --> 00:02:02.626 A:middle
percent growth.

00:02:03.696 --> 00:02:07.446 A:middle
With more than 400,000 podcasts

00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:09.616 A:middle
available, our catalog is more

00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:10.846 A:middle
robust than it's ever been.

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:12.996 A:middle
We have more than a thousand new

00:02:12.996 --> 00:02:14.626 A:middle
shows submitted each and every

00:02:14.626 --> 00:02:15.796 A:middle
week, so there's always

00:02:15.796 --> 00:02:17.366 A:middle
something new and great to

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:17.856 A:middle
discover.

00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:21.066 A:middle
We have more than 14 million

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:22.586 A:middle
episodes in the catalog.

00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:25.426 A:middle
That's mostly audio content, but

00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:26.866 A:middle
we have shows and episodes in

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.096 A:middle
more than 100 languages.

00:02:30.076 --> 00:02:31.766 A:middle
Apple Podcast is available in

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:34.586 A:middle
155 countries, not only for

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:37.046 A:middle
distribution of existing shows

00:02:37.346 --> 00:02:38.936 A:middle
but for submission of new shows.

00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:41.546 A:middle
We're particularly proud to have

00:02:43.916 --> 00:02:45.286 A:middle

00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:46.736 A:middle

These are just a few of the

00:03:06.946 --> 00:03:07.826 A:middle
global lineup.

00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:09.636 A:middle
We love working with our

partners in public media around

00:03:11.606 --> 00:03:13.216 A:middle
the world as well, whether it's

Our international cohort of

independent podcast networks is

00:03:29.886 --> 00:03:30.946 A:middle
producing some of the most

00:03:30.946 --> 00:03:32.916 A:middle

in Mumbai, India.

00:03:49.156 --> 00:03:51.226 A:middle
These, and other Indie

00:03:51.226 --> 00:03:53.046 A:middle
productions, such as Up and

00:03:53.046 --> 00:03:54.856 A:middle

Apple podcasts.

00:03:58.226 --> 00:04:00.376 A:middle
This show, Up and Vanished, is

00:04:00.376 --> 00:04:02.076 A:middle
an investigative story looking

00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:03.926 A:middle
at the tragic and mysterious

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:05.456 A:middle
disappearance of a Georgia

00:04:07.626 --> 00:04:08.016 A:middle

It's an 11-year-old cold case

00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:12.646 A:middle
that has captured an audience

00:04:12.646 --> 00:04:14.076 A:middle
around the world, and it's

00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:15.546 A:middle
delivered through the dynamic

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:16.986 A:middle
storytelling of amateur

investigator, Payne Lindsey.

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:21.946 A:middle
On the other end of the Indie

00:04:21.946 --> 00:04:24.206 A:middle
spectrum is Reid Hoffman and the

00:04:24.206 --> 00:04:26.036 A:middle

Hoffman is teaching key business

00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:32.126 A:middle
strategies, skills, and

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:34.216 A:middle
techniques through the anecdotes

00:04:34.246 --> 00:04:35.366 A:middle

00:04:35.446 --> 00:04:36.966 A:middle

Zuckerberg.

The audio production of

00:04:43.886 --> 00:04:45.716 A:middle

00:04:45.946 --> 00:04:47.526 A:middle

Her podcast features

completely unqualified Hollywood

00:04:56.336 --> 00:04:58.226 A:middle
types, and it's seriously funny.

00:04:58.846 --> 00:04:59.676 A:middle
This is an independent

00:04:59.676 --> 00:05:01.196 A:middle
production, often recorded at

00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:03.186 A:middle
her dining room table, and it

00:05:03.186 --> 00:05:04.356 A:middle
features her beloved sidekick

00:05:04.356 --> 00:05:06.106 A:middle

&gt;&gt; Thanks, James.

00:05:31.466 --> 00:05:33.496 A:middle
We have some great updates to

Podcasts app in iOS 11, and I'd

00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:36.396 A:middle
love to show them to you now.

00:05:38.836 --> 00:05:39.636 A:middle
First, you'll notice, we've

00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:40.806 A:middle
simplified the app.

00:05:41.056 --> 00:05:42.176 A:middle
There are four tabs across the

00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:42.476 A:middle
bottom.

00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:43.876 A:middle
We'll take a quick look at each

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:44.096 A:middle
one.

00:05:45.116 --> 00:05:46.126 A:middle
First up, Listen Now.

00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:48.296 A:middle
This is an upgrade to the

unplayed tab from the previous

00:05:49.876 --> 00:05:51.696 A:middle
versions of the Podcasts app.

00:05:51.966 --> 00:05:53.316 A:middle
Here, it's easy to resume any

00:05:53.316 --> 00:05:54.446 A:middle
episode you've already started

00:05:54.446 --> 00:05:56.466 A:middle

00:05:56.466 --> 00:05:57.886 A:middle
the Next episode from any of the

other podcasts that you're

subscribed to.

00:06:01.056 --> 00:06:02.536 A:middle
This will be very familiar if

00:06:02.536 --> 00:06:04.146 A:middle
you used Watch Now in the TV app

00:06:04.146 --> 00:06:04.446 A:middle
before.

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:08.396 A:middle
Next up is Library.

You can view downloaded

need to listen to.

00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:32.206 A:middle
It's really easy to pick up

00:06:32.206 --> 00:06:33.466 A:middle
where I left off with Continue

00:06:33.466 --> 00:06:35.636 A:middle

Here's one of those individual

00:06:44.526 --> 00:06:45.016 A:middle
episodes.

00:06:45.496 --> 00:06:46.726 A:middle
Here, I see the expanded show

00:06:46.726 --> 00:06:49.396 A:middle
notes, and I can see exactly how

00:06:49.396 --> 00:06:51.226 A:middle
much of this episode I have left

00:06:51.226 --> 00:06:51.756 A:middle
to listen to.

00:06:55.216 --> 00:06:56.916 A:middle
Next up, we have Browse.

00:06:57.196 --> 00:06:58.796 A:middle
This will be very familiar if

00:06:58.796 --> 00:07:00.546 A:middle
you've used the Music app.

00:07:01.936 --> 00:07:03.536 A:middle
We'll dive into Featured first.

00:07:04.526 --> 00:07:05.836 A:middle
Each week our editors to scour

00:07:05.836 --> 00:07:06.716 A:middle
all the latest shows and

00:07:06.716 --> 00:07:08.076 A:middle
episodes to bring you the best

00:07:08.076 --> 00:07:08.436 A:middle
of what's new.

00:07:11.436 --> 00:07:12.906 A:middle
We can also look at Top Charts.

00:07:13.426 --> 00:07:14.226 A:middle
Here, we have all the top

00:07:14.226 --> 00:07:15.436 A:middle
episodes and shows that are

00:07:15.436 --> 00:07:17.586 A:middle
trending right now, and I can

00:07:17.586 --> 00:07:19.336 A:middle
also browse featured providers

00:07:19.376 --> 00:07:20.476 A:middle
or dive deeper into my favorite

00:07:20.476 --> 00:07:20.976 A:middle
categories.

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:26.056 A:middle
And finally, we have Search.

00:07:27.126 --> 00:07:28.756 A:middle
Here, you can quickly find any

00:07:28.756 --> 00:07:30.186 A:middle
new show or episode in the Apple

00:07:30.186 --> 00:07:32.256 A:middle
Podcasts catalog or just scope

00:07:32.256 --> 00:07:33.516 A:middle
that search to your own library.

00:07:34.836 --> 00:07:36.216 A:middle
That's a quick overview of the

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:37.666 A:middle
Podcasts updates in iOS 11.

00:07:38.286 --> 00:07:39.726 A:middle
This is our biggest updates to

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:41.046 A:middle
the Podcasts apps since we first

00:07:41.046 --> 00:07:41.626 A:middle
launched in iOS.

00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:43.666 A:middle
We hope you get a chance to

00:07:43.666 --> 00:07:44.596 A:middle
check it out in the iOS

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:45.826 A:middle
developer preview and give us

00:07:45.826 --> 00:07:46.196 A:middle
your feedback.

00:07:47.756 --> 00:07:48.806 A:middle
Next up, I'd like to bring Garth

00:07:48.806 --> 00:07:49.656 A:middle
Jantzen up to the stage.

00:07:49.656 --> 00:07:50.686 A:middle
He's going to give you an

00:07:50.686 --> 00:07:52.136 A:middle
overview of the updates we're

00:07:52.136 --> 00:07:53.306 A:middle
making to the Apple Podcasts

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.686 A:middle
Spec to support some of these

00:07:54.686 --> 00:07:55.976 A:middle
great new features in iOS 11.

00:07:58.516 --> 00:08:03.036 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:08:03.536 --> 00:08:03.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, DJ.

00:08:03.926 --> 00:08:06.346 A:middle
Great to see you all here today.

00:08:07.416 --> 00:08:08.886 A:middle
So, today, we are excited to

00:08:08.886 --> 00:08:10.116 A:middle
talk about some updates we're

00:08:10.116 --> 00:08:11.916 A:middle
bringing to the Apple Podcasts

00:08:11.986 --> 00:08:13.746 A:middle
Feed Spec. These updates will

00:08:13.746 --> 00:08:15.826 A:middle
help podcast creators to take

00:08:15.826 --> 00:08:17.486 A:middle
full advantage of the redesigned

00:08:17.586 --> 00:08:19.246 A:middle
Apple Podcasts app in iOS 11

00:08:19.246 --> 00:08:20.756 A:middle
that you just saw, while also

00:08:20.756 --> 00:08:22.286 A:middle
making it easier for listeners

00:08:22.286 --> 00:08:23.996 A:middle
to discover and engage that

00:08:23.996 --> 00:08:24.446 A:middle
content.

00:08:25.016 --> 00:08:26.576 A:middle
So, to provide some context, I'd

00:08:26.576 --> 00:08:28.146 A:middle
like to start with an example of

00:08:28.146 --> 00:08:30.046 A:middle
what you might see today in iOS

00:08:30.186 --> 00:08:31.396 A:middle
10 when you subscribe to a new

00:08:31.396 --> 00:08:32.066 A:middle
podcast.

00:08:33.476 --> 00:08:34.446 A:middle
So, when you subscribe to a

00:08:34.446 --> 00:08:36.206 A:middle
podcast, we automatically put

00:08:36.206 --> 00:08:37.786 A:middle
the latest episode into your

00:08:37.786 --> 00:08:39.416 A:middle
unplayed episode list, which is

00:08:39.416 --> 00:08:40.996 A:middle
great for most podcasts.

00:08:41.416 --> 00:08:42.726 A:middle
But in the case of this example,

00:08:42.726 --> 00:08:43.676 A:middle
there's a couple of problems.

00:08:44.466 --> 00:08:45.916 A:middle
First, as you can see, this is

00:08:45.916 --> 00:08:47.866 A:middle
Episode 4 of what looks to be

00:08:48.016 --> 00:08:48.676 A:middle
Season 2.

00:08:49.246 --> 00:08:51.036 A:middle
So, in the case of this podcast,

00:08:51.036 --> 00:08:52.106 A:middle
it's actually intended to start

00:08:52.106 --> 00:08:53.666 A:middle
from the beginning with Episode

00:08:53.756 --> 00:08:54.996 A:middle
1 of Season 2.

00:08:55.656 --> 00:08:56.846 A:middle
Also, it required that the

00:08:56.846 --> 00:08:58.206 A:middle
podcast author put both the

00:08:58.206 --> 00:09:00.036 A:middle
season number and the episode

00:09:00.036 --> 00:09:01.336 A:middle
number in front of the title,

00:09:01.336 --> 00:09:02.216 A:middle
which isn't the best user

00:09:02.216 --> 00:09:02.926 A:middle
experience.

00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:05.246 A:middle
So, going over to the feed tab

00:09:05.426 --> 00:09:06.896 A:middle
when I look for Episode 1, 2,

00:09:06.896 --> 00:09:08.386 A:middle
and 3, I find that they're in

00:09:08.386 --> 00:09:09.426 A:middle
the wrong order, and it's

00:09:09.426 --> 00:09:10.926 A:middle
difficult to add those episodes

00:09:10.986 --> 00:09:12.446 A:middle
over to my unplayed list so I

00:09:12.446 --> 00:09:13.706 A:middle
can start from the beginning and

00:09:13.706 --> 00:09:15.276 A:middle
listen through in the correct

00:09:15.276 --> 00:09:15.546 A:middle
order.

00:09:16.206 --> 00:09:18.126 A:middle
So, all I can say is that we

00:09:18.126 --> 00:09:19.046 A:middle
think we can do better here.

00:09:19.236 --> 00:09:21.156 A:middle
So, to start, we're happy to

00:09:21.156 --> 00:09:22.426 A:middle
announce support for podcast

00:09:22.426 --> 00:09:24.216 A:middle
seasons in iOS 11.

00:09:25.206 --> 00:09:26.176 A:middle
So, seasons will allow

00:09:26.176 --> 00:09:27.836 A:middle
podcasters to group together

00:09:27.836 --> 00:09:29.646 A:middle
episodes where it makes sense

00:09:29.886 --> 00:09:31.476 A:middle
for their podcast content, and

00:09:31.476 --> 00:09:32.816 A:middle
within a season they'll also be

00:09:32.816 --> 00:09:34.156 A:middle
able to choose the order in

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:34.996 A:middle
which those episodes are

00:09:34.996 --> 00:09:36.526 A:middle
presented, whether it's newest

00:09:36.526 --> 00:09:38.216 A:middle
to oldest, or oldest to newest.

00:09:38.736 --> 00:09:40.076 A:middle
And utilizing the other tags

00:09:40.076 --> 00:09:41.336 A:middle
we're about to talk about that

00:09:41.336 --> 00:09:43.006 A:middle
we're adding, we'll be able to

00:09:43.006 --> 00:09:44.816 A:middle
present nice season headers and

00:09:44.816 --> 00:09:46.736 A:middle
concise titles to best present

00:09:47.136 --> 00:09:47.736 A:middle
the content.

00:09:49.086 --> 00:09:50.526 A:middle
New subscribers will also get

00:09:50.646 --> 00:09:52.366 A:middle
full, the full current season

00:09:52.366 --> 00:09:54.076 A:middle
automatically moved into their

00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:55.316 A:middle
Library in a new section called

00:09:55.316 --> 00:09:56.846 A:middle
My Episodes, which is going to

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:57.136 A:middle
be great.

00:09:57.486 --> 00:09:58.696 A:middle
We have a Quick Play action that

00:09:58.696 --> 00:09:59.766 A:middle
will allow listeners to start

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.206 A:middle
from the beginning, as intended,

00:10:01.496 --> 00:10:02.886 A:middle
or pick up right where they left

00:10:02.886 --> 00:10:02.976 A:middle
off.

00:10:03.046 --> 00:10:04.996 A:middle
So, now, let's look at the Spec

00:10:04.996 --> 00:10:06.286 A:middle
and see how all this ties

00:10:06.346 --> 00:10:06.666 A:middle
together.

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:10.106 A:middle
So, first, we have a new tag for

00:10:10.106 --> 00:10:11.566 A:middle
a podcast called Podcast type,

00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:13.836 A:middle
and iOS 11, we're starting off

00:10:13.836 --> 00:10:16.076 A:middle
with two podcast types, episodic

00:10:16.426 --> 00:10:17.076 A:middle
and serial.

00:10:18.796 --> 00:10:19.786 A:middle
So, first, episodic.

00:10:20.336 --> 00:10:21.676 A:middle
This is the default podcast

00:10:21.676 --> 00:10:22.786 A:middle
type, and the one you're used to

00:10:22.786 --> 00:10:24.486 A:middle
seeing in Apple Podcasts today.

00:10:24.796 --> 00:10:25.916 A:middle
This is best for standalone

00:10:25.916 --> 00:10:27.356 A:middle
episodes where listening order

00:10:27.356 --> 00:10:28.346 A:middle
isn't super important.

00:10:28.986 --> 00:10:30.526 A:middle
New subscribers as of today will

00:10:30.526 --> 00:10:32.316 A:middle
receive the latest episode or

00:10:32.316 --> 00:10:33.666 A:middle
the entire season, starting with

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:35.016 A:middle
the latest episode, if you're

00:10:35.016 --> 00:10:35.786 A:middle
using seasons.

00:10:37.506 --> 00:10:38.816 A:middle
So, serialize, this is new in

00:10:38.816 --> 00:10:39.566 A:middle
iOS 11.

00:10:39.566 --> 00:10:41.236 A:middle
We're really excited about this.

00:10:41.236 --> 00:10:42.506 A:middle
This is great where episodes are

00:10:42.506 --> 00:10:44.246 A:middle
recommended from beginning, from

00:10:44.246 --> 00:10:45.776 A:middle
oldest to newest, and it's great

00:10:45.776 --> 00:10:47.696 A:middle
for narrative, storytelling-type

00:10:47.696 --> 00:10:49.156 A:middle
podcasts, where it's important

00:10:49.156 --> 00:10:50.326 A:middle
to start from the beginning of a

00:10:50.326 --> 00:10:51.346 A:middle
season or show.

00:10:52.136 --> 00:10:53.486 A:middle
New subscribers will receive the

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:54.916 A:middle
first episode in their Library,

00:10:55.256 --> 00:10:56.756 A:middle
or the entire season, starting

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:57.956 A:middle
with the latest episode, with

00:10:57.956 --> 00:10:58.926 A:middle
the first episode if they're

00:10:58.926 --> 00:10:59.636 A:middle
using seasons.

00:11:01.676 --> 00:11:03.376 A:middle
So, next is title, which is a

00:11:03.376 --> 00:11:04.686 A:middle
new tag, and it's intended for

00:11:04.686 --> 00:11:06.266 A:middle
just the title of the episode.

00:11:06.386 --> 00:11:07.556 A:middle
We're asking that you leave off

00:11:07.746 --> 00:11:09.606 A:middle
the podcast title, the episode

00:11:09.606 --> 00:11:11.136 A:middle
number, season number, and the

00:11:11.136 --> 00:11:11.586 A:middle
dates.

00:11:11.586 --> 00:11:12.736 A:middle
We're going to use this

00:11:12.836 --> 00:11:14.006 A:middle
differently, depending on the

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:15.476 A:middle
context of your podcast type.

00:11:15.826 --> 00:11:16.906 A:middle
So, in this screen, you can see

00:11:16.906 --> 00:11:17.846 A:middle
that we're combining it with

00:11:17.846 --> 00:11:19.056 A:middle
some other metadata; in this

00:11:19.056 --> 00:11:20.706 A:middle
case, episode number, to best

00:11:20.706 --> 00:11:21.866 A:middle
represent an episode from a

00:11:21.866 --> 00:11:23.346 A:middle
serial podcast where episode

00:11:23.346 --> 00:11:24.186 A:middle
number is important.

00:11:25.886 --> 00:11:26.806 A:middle
And then, here, to best

00:11:26.806 --> 00:11:28.096 A:middle
represent an episode from an

00:11:28.096 --> 00:11:30.166 A:middle
episodic podcast, where episode

00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:31.606 A:middle
number isn't as important.

00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:35.156 A:middle
So, next, episode number.

00:11:35.156 --> 00:11:36.756 A:middle
So, this is a new tag, and

00:11:36.756 --> 00:11:38.216 A:middle
starting with your first episode

00:11:38.216 --> 00:11:39.656 A:middle
in your podcast, every episode

00:11:39.656 --> 00:11:40.706 A:middle
should have an incremental

00:11:40.706 --> 00:11:41.106 A:middle
number.

00:11:41.496 --> 00:11:43.096 A:middle
If you're using seasons, the

00:11:43.096 --> 00:11:43.996 A:middle
episode number should be

00:11:43.996 --> 00:11:45.796 A:middle
specific to that season.

00:11:47.546 --> 00:11:48.426 A:middle
Then, we have season number.

00:11:48.896 --> 00:11:50.366 A:middle
Every episode that's associated

00:11:50.366 --> 00:11:51.726 A:middle
with a particular season should

00:11:51.726 --> 00:11:53.146 A:middle
use the same season number.

00:11:53.456 --> 00:11:54.836 A:middle
We'll collect all the episodes

00:11:54.836 --> 00:11:56.206 A:middle
together and present them as

00:11:56.206 --> 00:11:57.506 A:middle
seasons to listen to with a nice

00:11:57.506 --> 00:11:57.766 A:middle
header.

00:11:58.186 --> 00:11:59.706 A:middle
We'll also give precedent to

00:11:59.766 --> 00:12:01.586 A:middle
your latest season first on your

00:12:01.586 --> 00:12:02.346 A:middle
podcast page.

00:12:03.126 --> 00:12:04.856 A:middle
So, using a combination of

00:12:04.856 --> 00:12:06.516 A:middle
episode title, episode number,

00:12:06.516 --> 00:12:08.076 A:middle
and season number, we can choose

00:12:08.076 --> 00:12:09.126 A:middle
how to best represent that

00:12:09.126 --> 00:12:10.316 A:middle
content in different parts of

00:12:10.316 --> 00:12:11.296 A:middle
the app, as you can see here.

00:12:12.776 --> 00:12:14.626 A:middle
So, next is summary tag.

00:12:14.716 --> 00:12:15.916 A:middle
This is an existing tag, and

00:12:15.916 --> 00:12:16.856 A:middle
this is the tag that we're

00:12:16.856 --> 00:12:18.536 A:middle
recommending you use to store a

00:12:18.536 --> 00:12:20.446 A:middle
descriptive sentence that best

00:12:20.446 --> 00:12:22.046 A:middle
represents that episode.

00:12:22.436 --> 00:12:23.406 A:middle
We'll use this in multiple

00:12:23.406 --> 00:12:24.496 A:middle
places in the app, so we're

00:12:24.496 --> 00:12:26.476 A:middle
asking that you leave out HTML,

00:12:26.576 --> 00:12:28.166 A:middle
CDATA, rich text formatting.

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:29.666 A:middle
In fact, we'll strip that out

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:32.006 A:middle
because that will let us handle

00:12:32.006 --> 00:12:34.066 A:middle
the truncation, and it'll let us

00:12:34.066 --> 00:12:35.276 A:middle
handle that description in

00:12:35.306 --> 00:12:36.176 A:middle
different parts of the app.

00:12:36.446 --> 00:12:37.326 A:middle
So, if you're using a content

00:12:37.326 --> 00:12:38.566 A:middle
management system that might

00:12:38.566 --> 00:12:39.766 A:middle
truncate that beforehand, we're

00:12:39.766 --> 00:12:40.886 A:middle
asking that you leave that, that

00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:42.486 A:middle
you don't do that so that we can

00:12:42.486 --> 00:12:45.346 A:middle
handle that and best present it.

00:12:46.026 --> 00:12:47.796 A:middle
So, content encoded, this is

00:12:47.796 --> 00:12:49.716 A:middle
specific for your episode notes,

00:12:49.766 --> 00:12:50.566 A:middle
and this is where you're going

00:12:50.566 --> 00:12:52.146 A:middle
to want to put that rich text,

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:53.706 A:middle
HTML, links.

00:12:53.776 --> 00:12:55.536 A:middle
We support paragraphs, lists,

00:12:55.796 --> 00:12:57.666 A:middle
bold and italics, and we're

00:12:57.666 --> 00:12:58.886 A:middle
going to use this on the Listen

00:12:58.886 --> 00:13:00.236 A:middle
Now view, as well within the

00:13:00.236 --> 00:13:01.676 A:middle
Episode Detail view, so

00:13:01.676 --> 00:13:03.316 A:middle
listeners can easily access any

00:13:03.316 --> 00:13:04.446 A:middle
links and notes while they

00:13:04.446 --> 00:13:05.436 A:middle
listen to your episode.

00:13:08.186 --> 00:13:09.856 A:middle
Another exciting update, we have

00:13:09.856 --> 00:13:10.576 A:middle
podcast type.

00:13:10.576 --> 00:13:12.016 A:middle
We also have episode type.

00:13:12.476 --> 00:13:14.126 A:middle
So, in iOS 11, we're coming out

00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:15.946 A:middle
with three episode types, a

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:18.136 A:middle
full, trailer and bonus.

00:13:18.546 --> 00:13:20.096 A:middle
So, full is the default episode

00:13:20.096 --> 00:13:21.036 A:middle
type, and it represents a

00:13:21.036 --> 00:13:22.156 A:middle
standard episode that you'd

00:13:22.156 --> 00:13:22.806 A:middle
expect today.

00:13:23.516 --> 00:13:25.046 A:middle
Trailer is a great new episode

00:13:25.046 --> 00:13:26.536 A:middle
type that can be either a

00:13:26.606 --> 00:13:28.366 A:middle
podcast level trailer or a

00:13:28.366 --> 00:13:30.086 A:middle
season level trailer, depending

00:13:30.086 --> 00:13:31.136 A:middle
on if there's a season number

00:13:31.176 --> 00:13:31.576 A:middle
present.

00:13:31.576 --> 00:13:33.086 A:middle
And this is great for teaser

00:13:33.086 --> 00:13:34.196 A:middle
trailers before you've launched

00:13:34.196 --> 00:13:35.446 A:middle
your show, or if you want to

00:13:35.446 --> 00:13:36.556 A:middle
highlight a trailer for a new

00:13:36.556 --> 00:13:37.116 A:middle
season.

00:13:37.596 --> 00:13:40.076 A:middle
Bonus is for an episode that

00:13:40.076 --> 00:13:41.696 A:middle
contains bonus content, which is

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:43.306 A:middle
great for supplemental content

00:13:43.306 --> 00:13:44.796 A:middle
associated with an existing

00:13:44.796 --> 00:13:45.316 A:middle
episode.

00:13:45.636 --> 00:13:47.586 A:middle
After-show, or review, we'll tie

00:13:47.586 --> 00:13:49.096 A:middle
them together in the UI, and

00:13:49.186 --> 00:13:50.656 A:middle
with the main episode, we'll

00:13:50.656 --> 00:13:51.446 A:middle
make it look really great.

00:13:52.276 --> 00:13:53.866 A:middle
So, we're really excited to see

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:55.686 A:middle
how podcasters utilize these new

00:13:55.686 --> 00:13:57.186 A:middle
episode types to make their

00:13:57.186 --> 00:13:58.866 A:middle
content even more engaging.

00:14:00.106 --> 00:14:01.586 A:middle
So, lastly, I want to call out

00:14:01.586 --> 00:14:02.726 A:middle
an existing, another existing

00:14:02.726 --> 00:14:04.196 A:middle
tag on the episode, the GUID.

00:14:04.836 --> 00:14:06.716 A:middle
So, GUID is a permanent global

00:14:06.716 --> 00:14:08.586 A:middle
unique identifier that specifies

00:14:08.686 --> 00:14:10.416 A:middle
that episode amongst your

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:10.766 A:middle
podcast.

00:14:11.136 --> 00:14:12.016 A:middle
We've seen some cases where

00:14:12.016 --> 00:14:13.086 A:middle
people end up changing their

00:14:13.086 --> 00:14:14.256 A:middle
GUID, perhaps if you change

00:14:14.256 --> 00:14:16.326 A:middle
hosting companies, or your RSS

00:14:16.326 --> 00:14:18.236 A:middle
URL changes, but it's really

00:14:18.236 --> 00:14:19.776 A:middle
important that you not change

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:20.686 A:middle
the GUID on an episode.

00:14:20.686 --> 00:14:22.226 A:middle
This can result in duplicate

00:14:22.226 --> 00:14:23.386 A:middle
episodes showing up in your

00:14:23.386 --> 00:14:25.056 A:middle
subscribers' Libraries, and it

00:14:25.056 --> 00:14:25.806 A:middle
can even hurt your chart

00:14:25.876 --> 00:14:26.936 A:middle
placement in the catalog.

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:30.926 A:middle
So, those are the highlights of

00:14:30.926 --> 00:14:32.406 A:middle
some of the updates coming to

00:14:32.406 --> 00:14:34.556 A:middle
the Apple Podcast Feed Spec.

00:14:34.556 --> 00:14:35.976 A:middle
These and all feed specs can be

00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:37.356 A:middle
found online in our Resources

00:14:37.356 --> 00:14:38.636 A:middle
and Help section, and we're

00:14:38.636 --> 00:14:39.526 A:middle
really excited to see how

00:14:39.526 --> 00:14:40.986 A:middle
podcast creators will use these

00:14:40.986 --> 00:14:43.256 A:middle
updates to create even more

00:14:43.436 --> 00:14:45.056 A:middle
content and better engaging

00:14:45.056 --> 00:14:46.226 A:middle
content for our listeners.

00:14:46.776 --> 00:14:47.886 A:middle
So, now that you've heard our

00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:49.346 A:middle
great updates, I'd like to bring

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:50.706 A:middle
James back up to talk about how

00:14:50.706 --> 00:14:51.916 A:middle
to make the best podcast

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:52.286 A:middle
possible.

00:14:52.956 --> 00:14:53.246 A:middle
James.

00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:56.321 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:14:56.626 --> 00:14:56.906 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:14:56.906 --> 00:14:57.496 A:middle
Thanks, Garth.

00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:02.646 A:middle
So, now that you've seen all the

00:15:02.646 --> 00:15:04.866 A:middle
new features of Podcasts app for

00:15:04.866 --> 00:15:06.776 A:middle
iOS 11, and the tags that we're

00:15:06.836 --> 00:15:08.596 A:middle
going to use, that we've just

00:15:08.596 --> 00:15:10.016 A:middle
announced, to power those new

00:15:10.016 --> 00:15:11.746 A:middle
features, let's walk through

00:15:11.746 --> 00:15:13.416 A:middle
creating and launching your own

00:15:13.416 --> 00:15:13.756 A:middle
show.

00:15:15.196 --> 00:15:16.586 A:middle
Well, first, you need something

00:15:16.586 --> 00:15:17.116 A:middle
to say.

00:15:17.356 --> 00:15:19.096 A:middle
You need an idea at the center

00:15:19.096 --> 00:15:21.036 A:middle
of your podcast as a concept

00:15:21.176 --> 00:15:22.666 A:middle
that will play out over the

00:15:22.666 --> 00:15:24.386 A:middle
course of your seasons and your

00:15:24.386 --> 00:15:25.046 A:middle
episodes.

00:15:25.636 --> 00:15:27.446 A:middle
Podcasts are unique in that

00:15:27.446 --> 00:15:29.116 A:middle
they're not constrained by the

00:15:29.116 --> 00:15:31.166 A:middle
formats of traditional media,

00:15:31.166 --> 00:15:32.156 A:middle
such as talk radio.

00:15:32.726 --> 00:15:34.146 A:middle
This is a place where great

00:15:34.146 --> 00:15:35.966 A:middle
stories will play out in long

00:15:35.966 --> 00:15:37.076 A:middle
form in audio.

00:15:37.846 --> 00:15:39.896 A:middle
So, our friends, Maria and John,

00:15:39.896 --> 00:15:41.796 A:middle
they needed a great idea for

00:15:41.796 --> 00:15:43.316 A:middle
their podcast project.

00:15:43.896 --> 00:15:46.426 A:middle
Maria has her Ph.D. in history,

00:15:46.736 --> 00:15:47.996 A:middle
and because she's passionate

00:15:47.996 --> 00:15:49.786 A:middle
about food, she knows a lot

00:15:49.786 --> 00:15:51.336 A:middle
about the history of different

00:15:51.336 --> 00:15:52.476 A:middle
cuisines around the world.

00:15:52.476 --> 00:15:55.346 A:middle
And her sidekick, John, loves to

00:15:55.346 --> 00:15:55.596 A:middle
eat.

00:15:56.536 --> 00:15:58.636 A:middle
So, what kind of a show could be

00:15:58.636 --> 00:16:00.146 A:middle
a vehicle for their love of

00:16:00.146 --> 00:16:03.426 A:middle
cuisine and maybe force them to

00:16:03.426 --> 00:16:04.396 A:middle
do some awesome travel?

00:16:05.916 --> 00:16:09.256 A:middle
The Very Hungry Tourists; Around

00:16:09.256 --> 00:16:10.816 A:middle
the world, one bite at a time.

00:16:10.816 --> 00:16:12.046 A:middle
They came up with their concept.

00:16:13.076 --> 00:16:15.336 A:middle
And now that Maria and John have

00:16:15.336 --> 00:16:17.196 A:middle
a concept for their show, they

00:16:17.196 --> 00:16:18.726 A:middle
dive into the research and

00:16:18.726 --> 00:16:19.676 A:middle
planning phase.

00:16:20.406 --> 00:16:22.416 A:middle
What podcasts out there already

00:16:22.416 --> 00:16:23.506 A:middle
cover their topic?

00:16:24.326 --> 00:16:25.356 A:middle
How could their podcast be

00:16:25.356 --> 00:16:25.886 A:middle
different?

00:16:26.006 --> 00:16:27.196 A:middle
Where is their potential

00:16:27.196 --> 00:16:28.576 A:middle
audience, and how would their

00:16:28.576 --> 00:16:30.146 A:middle
themes play out over the course

00:16:30.146 --> 00:16:30.956 A:middle
of their episodes?

00:16:31.506 --> 00:16:32.756 A:middle
How would they make their show

00:16:32.756 --> 00:16:33.556 A:middle
sustainable?

00:16:34.236 --> 00:16:35.786 A:middle
Is this a hobby or a business

00:16:35.916 --> 00:16:36.396 A:middle
project?

00:16:37.406 --> 00:16:38.686 A:middle
Well, sustainability is, of

00:16:38.686 --> 00:16:40.256 A:middle
course, a key to success at

00:16:40.256 --> 00:16:42.746 A:middle
podcasts, both creatively and

00:16:42.746 --> 00:16:44.706 A:middle
financially, and Maria and John

00:16:44.706 --> 00:16:45.576 A:middle
decide that making their

00:16:45.576 --> 00:16:46.896 A:middle
production financially

00:16:46.896 --> 00:16:48.336 A:middle
sustainable is important.

00:16:48.976 --> 00:16:50.286 A:middle
So, they looked at the biggest

00:16:50.416 --> 00:16:51.886 A:middle
and best podcasts in the

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:53.356 A:middle
business models that they used.

00:16:53.896 --> 00:16:55.336 A:middle
They found that ads and

00:16:55.386 --> 00:16:57.216 A:middle
sponsorship are by far the most

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:58.666 A:middle
common model.

00:16:59.596 --> 00:17:01.836 A:middle
Post-read ads, in particular are

00:17:01.836 --> 00:17:03.446 A:middle
successful and profitable.

00:17:04.226 --> 00:17:05.706 A:middle
The second model, donation.

00:17:06.436 --> 00:17:08.876 A:middle
This is the public media style,

00:17:08.956 --> 00:17:10.906 A:middle
listener and community supported

00:17:10.906 --> 00:17:12.716 A:middle
model, another great option for

00:17:12.716 --> 00:17:13.416 A:middle
podcasts.

00:17:14.226 --> 00:17:15.786 A:middle
Thirdly, they looked at upsell,

00:17:16.296 --> 00:17:17.796 A:middle
which is the idea that the

00:17:17.796 --> 00:17:19.526 A:middle
podcast audience coming to the

00:17:19.526 --> 00:17:22.146 A:middle
free podcast could be converted

00:17:22.546 --> 00:17:24.286 A:middle
to paying audience members

00:17:24.286 --> 00:17:25.616 A:middle
through the for sale products

00:17:25.616 --> 00:17:26.906 A:middle
related to the content of the

00:17:26.906 --> 00:17:27.446 A:middle
podcast.

00:17:28.106 --> 00:17:29.536 A:middle
So, for example, Maria's

00:17:29.596 --> 00:17:31.506 A:middle
ancient, Book of Ancient Roman

00:17:31.506 --> 00:17:33.446 A:middle
Recipes, available on iBooks,

00:17:33.446 --> 00:17:34.946 A:middle
was a great target destination

00:17:35.066 --> 00:17:36.186 A:middle
for the people interested in

00:17:36.186 --> 00:17:36.686 A:middle
their podcast.

00:17:37.226 --> 00:17:39.956 A:middle
When it comes to production

00:17:39.956 --> 00:17:41.986 A:middle
strategy, Maria and John

00:17:41.986 --> 00:17:43.946 A:middle
recognized that some of the most

00:17:43.946 --> 00:17:45.426 A:middle
popular podcasts in the world

00:17:45.536 --> 00:17:47.366 A:middle
used world class recording

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:47.956 A:middle
studios.

00:17:48.516 --> 00:17:50.636 A:middle
The pristine sound and extensive

00:17:50.696 --> 00:17:52.096 A:middle
post production that results

00:17:52.096 --> 00:17:53.946 A:middle
from this kind of facility gives

00:17:53.946 --> 00:17:55.586 A:middle
you a high quality of audio

00:17:55.586 --> 00:17:56.156 A:middle
episodes.

00:17:56.206 --> 00:17:57.056 A:middle
It's fantastic.

00:17:57.306 --> 00:17:58.776 A:middle
And incidentally, I hope you got

00:17:58.776 --> 00:18:00.176 A:middle
a chance to try our podcast

00:18:00.176 --> 00:18:02.396 A:middle
studio here at WWDC, above the

00:18:02.396 --> 00:18:02.976 A:middle
main floor.

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:04.976 A:middle
We've been around this week, and

00:18:04.976 --> 00:18:06.196 A:middle
it has been a great success.

00:18:07.516 --> 00:18:09.246 A:middle
Maria and John, of course, they

00:18:09.246 --> 00:18:10.136 A:middle
needed something a little less

00:18:10.136 --> 00:18:11.396 A:middle
expensive than a traditional

00:18:11.396 --> 00:18:11.906 A:middle
studio.

00:18:12.536 --> 00:18:14.176 A:middle
They wanted something portable

00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:15.976 A:middle
and easy to use without the need

00:18:15.976 --> 00:18:17.266 A:middle
of an audio engineer or a

00:18:17.266 --> 00:18:18.416 A:middle
dedicated producer.

00:18:19.106 --> 00:18:20.566 A:middle
They found that the built-in mic

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:22.826 A:middle
and the variety of high quality,

00:18:23.056 --> 00:18:25.696 A:middle
third-party microphones made for

00:18:25.696 --> 00:18:26.956 A:middle
iPhone sound just great.

00:18:28.576 --> 00:18:31.586 A:middle
So, our heroes finished the

00:18:31.586 --> 00:18:33.486 A:middle
production plan for Season 1 of

00:18:33.486 --> 00:18:34.706 A:middle
The Very Hungry Tourists.

00:18:35.166 --> 00:18:36.386 A:middle
Now, it's time to think about

00:18:36.386 --> 00:18:38.196 A:middle
launch, and their go to market

00:18:38.196 --> 00:18:39.346 A:middle
distribution strategy.

00:18:39.966 --> 00:18:40.816 A:middle
But first, they've got to

00:18:40.816 --> 00:18:42.626 A:middle
consider the visual identity and

00:18:42.626 --> 00:18:43.946 A:middle
the metadata of their show.

00:18:44.826 --> 00:18:46.726 A:middle
Cover art and metadata is the

00:18:46.726 --> 00:18:48.446 A:middle
product packaging of your

00:18:48.446 --> 00:18:49.176 A:middle
podcast.

00:18:49.516 --> 00:18:51.076 A:middle
So, the importance of these

00:18:51.076 --> 00:18:52.916 A:middle
pieces is hard to overstate.

00:18:54.506 --> 00:18:56.026 A:middle
Maria and John, their first pass

00:18:56.026 --> 00:18:57.376 A:middle
at cover art design had some

00:18:57.376 --> 00:18:57.996 A:middle
challenges.

00:18:58.676 --> 00:19:00.626 A:middle
They've chosen to include both

00:19:00.626 --> 00:19:02.286 A:middle
of their personal production

00:19:02.326 --> 00:19:04.726 A:middle
company logos on top of their

00:19:04.726 --> 00:19:05.616 A:middle
central image.

00:19:06.306 --> 00:19:08.086 A:middle
And the central thematic image,

00:19:08.196 --> 00:19:10.246 A:middle
while it's thematically relevant

00:19:10.246 --> 00:19:12.176 A:middle
and appropriate, it's complex,

00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:14.136 A:middle
and it makes the overlaid text

00:19:14.196 --> 00:19:15.876 A:middle
hard to read.

00:19:16.066 --> 00:19:17.406 A:middle
Also, the font size that they've

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:18.746 A:middle
chosen, especially on the

00:19:18.746 --> 00:19:21.376 A:middle
subtitle, is really small and

00:19:21.376 --> 00:19:22.286 A:middle
hard to read on mobile.

00:19:23.376 --> 00:19:26.576 A:middle
So, the duo then run through our

00:19:26.576 --> 00:19:28.226 A:middle
best practices for cover art,

00:19:28.386 --> 00:19:29.396 A:middle
using our checklist.

00:19:30.196 --> 00:19:32.426 A:middle
They lay out a 3000 by 3000

00:19:32.476 --> 00:19:36.366 A:middle
pixel JPEG or PNG compressed to

00:19:36.366 --> 00:19:38.106 A:middle
be under 1 megabyte in size, so

00:19:38.106 --> 00:19:39.116 A:middle
it's nice and lightweight for

00:19:39.116 --> 00:19:41.016 A:middle
download with a clearly readable

00:19:41.016 --> 00:19:44.296 A:middle
title and one thematic image or

00:19:44.296 --> 00:19:46.026 A:middle
logo central to the design.

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:49.146 A:middle
This is a design first for

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:51.276 A:middle
mobile where most of their

00:19:51.276 --> 00:19:52.666 A:middle
potential audience is going to

00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:53.366 A:middle
live on iPhone.

00:19:54.516 --> 00:19:56.876 A:middle
So, the second pass at their

00:19:56.876 --> 00:19:58.276 A:middle
design was much improved.

00:19:58.276 --> 00:19:59.526 A:middle
Maria and John ran through the

00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:00.706 A:middle
checklist, and this was the

00:20:00.746 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
result.

00:20:01.746 --> 00:20:03.486 A:middle
It' looks great on mobile, and

00:20:03.486 --> 00:20:05.676 A:middle
it becomes the basis for the

00:20:05.676 --> 00:20:07.586 A:middle
visual identity of their

00:20:07.586 --> 00:20:08.256 A:middle
podcast.

00:20:08.856 --> 00:20:10.226 A:middle
So, this runs across social

00:20:10.226 --> 00:20:12.546 A:middle
media, blogs, traditional media,

00:20:12.846 --> 00:20:14.296 A:middle
and other audience-building

00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:15.706 A:middle
destinations for their

00:20:15.706 --> 00:20:17.726 A:middle
marketing, a single design

00:20:17.806 --> 00:20:19.066 A:middle
that's reasonable and

00:20:19.066 --> 00:20:19.726 A:middle
expandable.

00:20:22.196 --> 00:20:24.496 A:middle
Similarly, Maria and John run

00:20:24.496 --> 00:20:26.016 A:middle
through our metadata checklist

00:20:26.616 --> 00:20:27.436 A:middle
where they land on their

00:20:27.436 --> 00:20:30.016 A:middle
concise, attractive title with

00:20:30.016 --> 00:20:31.496 A:middle
thorough descriptions, both at

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:32.986 A:middle
the podcast level and the

00:20:32.986 --> 00:20:33.876 A:middle
episode level.

00:20:34.456 --> 00:20:36.196 A:middle
They also make good use of our

00:20:36.196 --> 00:20:38.256 A:middle
newly announced podcast type and

00:20:38.256 --> 00:20:39.436 A:middle
episode number tags in their

00:20:39.436 --> 00:20:41.806 A:middle
feed and, of course, thoughtful

00:20:41.806 --> 00:20:43.546 A:middle
episode titles, putting the most

00:20:43.546 --> 00:20:45.606 A:middle
important information about each

00:20:45.606 --> 00:20:47.386 A:middle
individual episode, such as the

00:20:47.386 --> 00:20:49.096 A:middle
subject matter or the guests

00:20:49.216 --> 00:20:50.716 A:middle
right in the first bit of text

00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:51.186 A:middle
of the title.

00:20:51.966 --> 00:20:53.826 A:middle
And of course, they provide a

00:20:53.826 --> 00:20:56.526 A:middle
useful link for those super fans

00:20:56.526 --> 00:20:57.696 A:middle
that want to go beyond the

00:20:57.696 --> 00:20:59.276 A:middle
podcast, connect to [inaudible]

00:20:59.406 --> 00:21:01.376 A:middle
on the greater Web and then have

00:21:01.376 --> 00:21:01.726 A:middle
more.

00:21:02.346 --> 00:21:06.436 A:middle
So, distribution; once Maria and

00:21:06.436 --> 00:21:08.546 A:middle
John have their podcast episodes

00:21:08.546 --> 00:21:10.126 A:middle
recorded, they've designed their

00:21:10.126 --> 00:21:11.986 A:middle
cover art, the metadata has been

00:21:11.986 --> 00:21:13.736 A:middle
written, they need a hosting

00:21:13.736 --> 00:21:15.106 A:middle
partner to distribute their

00:21:15.106 --> 00:21:15.636 A:middle
content.

00:21:16.296 --> 00:21:18.316 A:middle
Our podcast resources and help

00:21:18.316 --> 00:21:20.576 A:middle
site on Apple.com features a

00:21:20.576 --> 00:21:22.486 A:middle
handy list of Apple podcasts

00:21:22.486 --> 00:21:23.426 A:middle
hosting partners.

00:21:24.186 --> 00:21:25.376 A:middle
These organizations are from

00:21:25.376 --> 00:21:26.396 A:middle
different regions around the

00:21:26.396 --> 00:21:27.786 A:middle
world, and they offer us

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:29.536 A:middle
different product packages and

00:21:29.536 --> 00:21:30.836 A:middle
features and price points.

00:21:31.176 --> 00:21:32.796 A:middle
So, Maria and John shop around

00:21:32.796 --> 00:21:34.216 A:middle
for the best package for them.

00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:36.656 A:middle
Launch planning.

00:21:36.656 --> 00:21:38.576 A:middle
Now, Maria and John can consider

00:21:38.576 --> 00:21:39.946 A:middle
their launch and go to market

00:21:39.946 --> 00:21:40.476 A:middle
plans.

00:21:41.146 --> 00:21:41.996 A:middle
They decide to launch with a

00:21:41.996 --> 00:21:43.726 A:middle
trailer as a teaser bit of

00:21:43.726 --> 00:21:45.546 A:middle
content to drive awareness.

00:21:46.196 --> 00:21:47.376 A:middle
They also look into marketing,

00:21:47.376 --> 00:21:49.036 A:middle
social media; of course, paid

00:21:49.036 --> 00:21:49.636 A:middle
and organic.

00:21:50.086 --> 00:21:52.376 A:middle
They look at podcast, app, and

00:21:52.426 --> 00:21:54.516 A:middle
search engine ads to drive

00:21:54.516 --> 00:21:56.346 A:middle
additional awareness and, of

00:21:56.346 --> 00:21:57.636 A:middle
course, appearances.

00:21:58.046 --> 00:21:59.806 A:middle
This is the idea that Maria and

00:21:59.806 --> 00:22:01.526 A:middle
John can not only appear on

00:22:01.576 --> 00:22:03.176 A:middle
other existing and popular

00:22:03.176 --> 00:22:05.406 A:middle
podcasts to make those audiences

00:22:05.406 --> 00:22:07.036 A:middle
that are maybe thematically

00:22:07.036 --> 00:22:08.646 A:middle
related to their show aware of

00:22:08.646 --> 00:22:10.296 A:middle
their new content offering, but

00:22:10.296 --> 00:22:11.566 A:middle
of course taking advantage too

00:22:11.566 --> 00:22:12.966 A:middle
of any traditional media outlets

00:22:13.276 --> 00:22:13.876 A:middle
where they can make an

00:22:13.876 --> 00:22:15.016 A:middle
appearance and talk about their

00:22:15.016 --> 00:22:17.636 A:middle
new show as well.

00:22:18.096 --> 00:22:19.486 A:middle
Maria and John also make good

00:22:19.486 --> 00:22:20.876 A:middle
use of our marketing tools for

00:22:20.876 --> 00:22:22.616 A:middle
podcasts, including our Identity

00:22:22.616 --> 00:22:24.256 A:middle
Guide, which will give you best

00:22:24.256 --> 00:22:25.946 A:middle
practices for using our Listen

00:22:25.946 --> 00:22:27.896 A:middle
on Apple Podcasts badges for

00:22:27.896 --> 00:22:29.826 A:middle
print, web, and broadcast

00:22:29.826 --> 00:22:30.476 A:middle
appearances.

00:22:31.036 --> 00:22:32.436 A:middle
The Affiliate Program offers a

00:22:32.436 --> 00:22:34.736 A:middle
unique way for people to link to

00:22:34.736 --> 00:22:36.116 A:middle
their podcasts, and it features

00:22:36.116 --> 00:22:37.436 A:middle
its own resources site.

00:22:38.216 --> 00:22:39.516 A:middle
Additionally, Maria and John

00:22:39.516 --> 00:22:41.036 A:middle
research and implement our

00:22:41.036 --> 00:22:42.376 A:middle
linking tools like Banner

00:22:42.376 --> 00:22:43.596 A:middle
Builder and Widget Builder.

00:22:44.176 --> 00:22:47.466 A:middle
Our heroes, they're ready to

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:48.996 A:middle
submit to Apple Podcasts for

00:22:48.996 --> 00:22:49.836 A:middle
review and approval.

00:22:50.216 --> 00:22:51.766 A:middle
So, Maria logs into Podcasts

00:22:51.766 --> 00:22:53.946 A:middle
Connect, pastes the feed URL

00:22:53.946 --> 00:22:56.656 A:middle
from their hosting partner, and

00:22:56.656 --> 00:22:58.196 A:middle
after approval of their podcast,

00:22:58.416 --> 00:22:59.866 A:middle
Maria and John launch the Very

00:22:59.866 --> 00:23:00.646 A:middle
Hungry Tourists.

00:23:01.186 --> 00:23:02.936 A:middle
What was once merely a moment of

00:23:02.936 --> 00:23:04.686 A:middle
inspiration is now a written,

00:23:04.686 --> 00:23:06.656 A:middle
produced, and easily available

00:23:06.656 --> 00:23:07.326 A:middle
podcast.

00:23:08.196 --> 00:23:09.646 A:middle
The work of audience building

00:23:09.646 --> 00:23:11.036 A:middle
now begins, and we wish them

00:23:11.036 --> 00:23:11.436 A:middle
good luck.

00:23:11.986 --> 00:23:13.196 A:middle
We certainly will be listening.

00:23:13.836 --> 00:23:17.786 A:middle
We'll be listening, but how many

00:23:17.786 --> 00:23:18.826 A:middle
others are listening?

00:23:19.596 --> 00:23:21.896 A:middle
Once Maria and John launch and

00:23:21.896 --> 00:23:23.336 A:middle
begin marketing their podcast,

00:23:23.436 --> 00:23:24.636 A:middle
of course, they want to know how

00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:25.066 A:middle
it's doing.

00:23:25.876 --> 00:23:28.086 A:middle
Their hosting platform offers a

00:23:28.086 --> 00:23:29.576 A:middle
nice variety of server side

00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:30.936 A:middle
reporting, which is very useful,

00:23:31.726 --> 00:23:33.356 A:middle
but they want to know what's

00:23:33.356 --> 00:23:34.686 A:middle
actually happening on Apple

00:23:34.686 --> 00:23:35.406 A:middle
Podcasts.

00:23:35.936 --> 00:23:37.106 A:middle
How many people are listening?

00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:39.106 A:middle
How much do they listen?

00:23:39.746 --> 00:23:40.686 A:middle
Where are they listening?

00:23:42.036 --> 00:23:44.106 A:middle
So many questions about audience

00:23:44.106 --> 00:23:45.736 A:middle
and usage, what could we do to

00:23:45.736 --> 00:23:48.116 A:middle
help Maria and John?

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:50.146 A:middle
Well, we're thrilled to announce

00:23:50.426 --> 00:23:52.286 A:middle
Podcast Analytics, and we want

00:23:52.286 --> 00:23:53.416 A:middle
to give you a sneak peek today.

00:23:55.046 --> 00:23:56.226 A:middle
Yes, all right.

00:23:56.226 --> 00:23:56.686 A:middle
Thank you.

00:23:57.676 --> 00:23:58.606 A:middle
We're thrilled to be sharing

00:23:58.606 --> 00:23:59.086 A:middle
this with you.

00:23:59.086 --> 00:24:00.776 A:middle
Our new reporting tool for

00:24:00.776 --> 00:24:03.146 A:middle
podcast providers will allow you

00:24:03.266 --> 00:24:05.226 A:middle
to see how much of your podcast

00:24:05.266 --> 00:24:07.166 A:middle
episodes are played and when on

00:24:07.166 --> 00:24:08.936 A:middle
Apple Podcasts, compare the

00:24:08.936 --> 00:24:10.866 A:middle
performance of your episodes and

00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:13.886 A:middle
podcasts over time, and see

00:24:13.886 --> 00:24:15.776 A:middle
which parts of your episodes are

00:24:15.806 --> 00:24:17.166 A:middle
more interesting than others.

00:24:17.546 --> 00:24:19.096 A:middle
Are people skipping over your

00:24:19.096 --> 00:24:20.656 A:middle
extended music intro, or maybe

00:24:20.656 --> 00:24:21.686 A:middle
your second mid roll?

00:24:22.636 --> 00:24:23.866 A:middle
We're doing this in a way that

00:24:23.866 --> 00:24:25.666 A:middle
respects user privacy,

00:24:25.796 --> 00:24:28.046 A:middle
aggregating usage data rather

00:24:28.046 --> 00:24:29.716 A:middle
than sharing individual events.

00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:32.186 A:middle
Analytics are not tied to

00:24:32.186 --> 00:24:34.546 A:middle
individual Apple IDs, and users

00:24:34.546 --> 00:24:36.336 A:middle
can reset their identifier at

00:24:37.106 --> 00:24:37.946 A:middle
any time.

00:24:38.166 --> 00:24:39.506 A:middle
We know that you'll have lots of

00:24:39.506 --> 00:24:40.946 A:middle
questions, and we're excited

00:24:40.946 --> 00:24:42.596 A:middle
about Podcast Analytics too, but

00:24:42.906 --> 00:24:44.176 A:middle
we're still in development, so

00:24:44.176 --> 00:24:45.346 A:middle
we're going to ask you to, if

00:24:45.346 --> 00:24:47.776 A:middle
you can, hold questions until

00:24:48.136 --> 00:24:50.496 A:middle
Podcast Analytics launches later

00:24:52.496 --> 00:24:52.796 A:middle
this year.

00:24:53.086 --> 00:24:55.186 A:middle
Launching this week, updates to

00:24:55.186 --> 00:24:57.156 A:middle
our Apple Podcasts Spec and the

00:24:57.156 --> 00:24:58.526 A:middle
documentation to help you

00:24:58.526 --> 00:24:59.636 A:middle
implement those changes.

00:25:00.276 --> 00:25:02.206 A:middle
New Podcasts app in iOS 11

00:25:02.206 --> 00:25:04.286 A:middle
developer preview with improved

00:25:04.286 --> 00:25:05.836 A:middle
presentation of podcasts, and

00:25:06.036 --> 00:25:07.826 A:middle
the infrastructure for Podcast

00:25:07.986 --> 00:25:08.596 A:middle
Analytics.

00:25:10.376 --> 00:25:12.686 A:middle
There's more information on our

00:25:12.686 --> 00:25:13.596 A:middle
Session page on

00:25:13.596 --> 00:25:15.326 A:middle
developer.apple.com.

00:25:15.326 --> 00:25:15.846 A:middle
Thank you very much.
