[ Background Sounds ]

00:00:22.716 --> 00:00:24.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I have a hunch that most of

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:26.186 A:middle
you probably found yourself in

00:00:26.186 --> 00:00:27.156 A:middle
this situation before.

00:00:28.706 --> 00:00:30.356 A:middle
A long list of names, a lot of

00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:33.666 A:middle
scrolling, many doubts, until

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.686 A:middle
you have to embrace the fact

00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:35.386 A:middle
that you don't know what you're

00:00:35.386 --> 00:00:36.576 A:middle
doing, so you just wing it.

00:00:38.146 --> 00:00:39.116 A:middle
But is there a better way to

00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:39.636 A:middle
pick fonts?

00:00:40.986 --> 00:00:41.476 A:middle
Yes, there is.

00:00:42.136 --> 00:00:43.866 A:middle
You're probably familiar with a

00:00:43.946 --> 00:00:45.806 A:middle
San Francisco font, the system

00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:45.986 A:middle
font.

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:48.896 A:middle
It's minimal, functional, and it

00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:50.496 A:middle
provides great visual continuity

00:00:50.496 --> 00:00:52.076 A:middle
between the system and your app.

00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:53.716 A:middle
But sometimes, you need

00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:54.436 A:middle
something different.

00:00:55.916 --> 00:00:57.026 A:middle
Perhaps you want your app to

00:00:57.026 --> 00:00:58.096 A:middle
exude sophistication?

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:00.266 A:middle
Or feel literary?

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:02.506 A:middle
Be awkward?

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:06.346 A:middle
Or just loud and upfront?

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:09.776 A:middle
How do you figure out which type

00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:11.056 A:middle
facing style is the right one

00:01:11.056 --> 00:01:11.436 A:middle
for your app?

00:01:12.616 --> 00:01:13.476 A:middle
Well, you need to answer at

00:01:13.476 --> 00:01:14.446 A:middle
least two questions.

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:17.586 A:middle
What is my intended use?

00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:19.406 A:middle
And this will touch on the

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:21.156 A:middle
functional aspects, "What

00:01:21.156 --> 00:01:22.346 A:middle
impression do I want to make?"

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.026 A:middle
This requires to look into how

00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:25.446 A:middle
style affects the visual mood of

00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:26.106 A:middle
an app.

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.576 A:middle
Once these questions have

00:01:27.576 --> 00:01:29.126 A:middle
answers, you can stop thinking

00:01:29.126 --> 00:01:30.156 A:middle
about the pairing of fonts.

00:01:31.506 --> 00:01:33.276 A:middle
But first, I'd like to introduce

00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:34.836 A:middle
two terms in the context of

00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:36.676 A:middle
typography: Structure and

00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:37.076 A:middle
contrast.

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:40.406 A:middle
To better understand typography,

00:01:40.406 --> 00:01:42.296 A:middle
it is usually helpful to look

00:01:42.296 --> 00:01:43.106 A:middle
into calligraphy.

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:44.656 A:middle
Calligraphy is the art of

00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:46.136 A:middle
writing, and to write, you need

00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:46.356 A:middle
a tool.

00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:48.616 A:middle
For instance, here are three

00:01:48.616 --> 00:01:50.586 A:middle
commonly used tools around the

00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:51.056 A:middle
world.

00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:53.776 A:middle
On the left, we have the brush,

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:55.616 A:middle
which is essential to most East

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:56.606 A:middle
Asian calligraphy and

00:01:56.606 --> 00:01:57.156 A:middle
typography.

00:01:58.306 --> 00:01:59.526 A:middle
In the middle, we have the

00:01:59.526 --> 00:02:00.826 A:middle
Rodney pen or Kalamos.

00:02:01.736 --> 00:02:02.946 A:middle
It has defined Roman letter

00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:04.986 A:middle
forms, the Arabic Naskh style,

00:02:05.246 --> 00:02:06.556 A:middle
or many index scripts.

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:09.546 A:middle
And on the right, we have the

00:02:09.606 --> 00:02:11.196 A:middle
pointed pen, the tool that gives

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:12.606 A:middle
precise control of a stroke

00:02:12.606 --> 00:02:14.276 A:middle
modulation, a feature that

00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:16.086 A:middle
really shines with some Cyrillic

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.056 A:middle
glyphs, for instance.

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:21.876 A:middle
But whatever the effect a

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:23.876 A:middle
calligraphic tool has, it can

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:25.356 A:middle
always be described in terms of

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:26.556 A:middle
structure and contrast.

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:28.746 A:middle
And here's structure.

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:30.886 A:middle
You can think of it as the path

00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:32.176 A:middle
a tool follows to achieve a

00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:32.956 A:middle
particular shape.

00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:34.526 A:middle
Those of us who like to be

00:02:34.526 --> 00:02:36.126 A:middle
fancy, also use the Latin word

00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:37.586 A:middle
ductus to refer to structure.

00:02:39.116 --> 00:02:40.996 A:middle
Now, to demonstrate contrast,

00:02:40.996 --> 00:02:42.366 A:middle
let me use a personal favorite

00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:43.426 A:middle
among the tools I just showed,

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:44.056 A:middle
the pointed pen.

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:47.116 A:middle
If I drag it across the screen,

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:48.386 A:middle
I get a very simple line.

00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:50.976 A:middle
Now, if I do the same but this

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:52.716 A:middle
time, pressing as I drag it, I

00:02:52.716 --> 00:02:53.596 A:middle
introduce weight.

00:02:54.666 --> 00:02:55.676 A:middle
And this modulation of the

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:56.846 A:middle
stroke is what we call

00:02:56.916 --> 00:02:57.356 A:middle
"contrast."

00:02:58.516 --> 00:02:59.596 A:middle
So, let's now apply this to

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:00.206 A:middle
letter forms.

00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:02.986 A:middle
Here are two structures for

00:03:02.986 --> 00:03:04.816 A:middle
lowercase N, or two ducti for

00:03:04.816 --> 00:03:05.506 A:middle
fancy people.

00:03:06.646 --> 00:03:08.516 A:middle
The one on the left, can be

00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:10.316 A:middle
traced with a single stroke.

00:03:10.476 --> 00:03:11.566 A:middle
This kind of structure is called

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:13.076 A:middle
cursive, and is inherently

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:13.446 A:middle
dynamic.

00:03:15.146 --> 00:03:16.506 A:middle
The one on the right, requires

00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:18.266 A:middle
several constructed pen strokes,

00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:19.856 A:middle
and therefore feels more static.

00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:24.456 A:middle
These monolinear designs have no

00:03:24.456 --> 00:03:25.476 A:middle
contrast right now.

00:03:25.636 --> 00:03:26.516 A:middle
So, let me add some.

00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:29.636 A:middle
As we add weight to the vertical

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:30.946 A:middle
strokes, the difference between

00:03:31.016 --> 00:03:33.196 A:middle
thick and thin increases, until

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:34.536 A:middle
we reach high contrast.

00:03:36.786 --> 00:03:38.196 A:middle
If I now add weight to the thin

00:03:38.196 --> 00:03:40.156 A:middle
strokes, we move toward low

00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:40.726 A:middle
contrast.

00:03:41.246 --> 00:03:42.346 A:middle
Now the main difference with our

00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:44.046 A:middle
starting point is mostly weight.

00:03:46.296 --> 00:03:47.326 A:middle
So, you may be thinking now,

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:48.316 A:middle
"Well, this is all fine and

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:49.596 A:middle
dandy, but why do I need to care

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:50.126 A:middle
about this?"

00:03:51.386 --> 00:03:52.546 A:middle
So, let's have a look at those

00:03:52.546 --> 00:03:53.496 A:middle
two sentences.

00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:55.316 A:middle
At this particular size, the

00:03:55.316 --> 00:03:56.636 A:middle
bottom line is much easier to

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:57.346 A:middle
read than the top line.

00:03:58.866 --> 00:04:00.256 A:middle
And we can easily understand why

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:01.466 A:middle
if we look closer at each

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:01.826 A:middle
design.

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:05.366 A:middle
On top, we have Big Caslon.

00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:07.586 A:middle
And below, Adobe Caslon prompt.

00:04:08.516 --> 00:04:11.136 A:middle
Both designs are revivals of the

00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:12.456 A:middle
work of British type founder

00:04:12.456 --> 00:04:14.466 A:middle
William Caslon, but one is

00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:15.816 A:middle
designed for this play, and the

00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:16.776 A:middle
other one for text.

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:18.946 A:middle
Now what does this mean,

00:04:18.946 --> 00:04:19.426 A:middle
exactly?

00:04:23.486 --> 00:04:25.836 A:middle
The thin strokes in Big Caslon,

00:04:26.006 --> 00:04:28.386 A:middle
produce high contrast, which is

00:04:28.386 --> 00:04:29.616 A:middle
an appealing graphical feature.

00:04:29.996 --> 00:04:31.256 A:middle
It looks sharp.

00:04:31.706 --> 00:04:32.966 A:middle
But if you scale it down, the

00:04:32.966 --> 00:04:34.196 A:middle
thin strokes will eventually

00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:35.516 A:middle
disappear and will make reading

00:04:35.516 --> 00:04:36.546 A:middle
quite unpleasant, if not

00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:37.126 A:middle
impossible.

00:04:38.316 --> 00:04:40.416 A:middle
On the other hand, Adobe Caslon

00:04:40.456 --> 00:04:42.296 A:middle
Pro has lower contrast and can

00:04:42.296 --> 00:04:43.686 A:middle
be used as smaller point sizes,

00:04:43.686 --> 00:04:45.016 A:middle
because of its sturdier design.

00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:47.166 A:middle
And now the key difference

00:04:47.196 --> 00:04:48.656 A:middle
between those two designs is

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:49.126 A:middle
spacing.

00:04:50.126 --> 00:04:51.696 A:middle
For optical reasons, reading

00:04:51.776 --> 00:04:53.476 A:middle
stays comfortable if the space

00:04:53.506 --> 00:04:55.566 A:middle
between letters increases as the

00:04:55.646 --> 00:04:56.846 A:middle
point size decreases.

00:04:57.696 --> 00:04:59.816 A:middle
Adobe Caslon Pro has looser

00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:01.516 A:middle
spacing and this contributes to

00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:03.076 A:middle
a nicer reading experience at

00:05:03.076 --> 00:05:03.666 A:middle
smaller size.

00:05:06.076 --> 00:05:07.506 A:middle
Display and text are really just

00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:09.206 A:middle
loose terms describing usage.

00:05:09.346 --> 00:05:11.766 A:middle
This play type is meant to draw

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:12.276 A:middle
attention.

00:05:13.136 --> 00:05:14.346 A:middle
So, you typically use it at

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:15.726 A:middle
bigger point sizes, which in

00:05:16.456 --> 00:05:18.586 A:middle
turn allows you to use styles

00:05:18.636 --> 00:05:20.176 A:middle
with more high -- with higher

00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:21.656 A:middle
contrast and more elaborate

00:05:21.656 --> 00:05:22.006 A:middle
details.

00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:23.756 A:middle
Text type is about making the

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.386 A:middle
reading experience comfortable.

00:05:27.146 --> 00:05:29.096 A:middle
When picking a text font, you'll

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:30.486 A:middle
want to make sure the contrast

00:05:30.486 --> 00:05:32.246 A:middle
of the type face is such that it

00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:33.506 A:middle
will scale down nicely.

00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:35.406 A:middle
The spacing should also feel

00:05:35.406 --> 00:05:36.586 A:middle
comfortable at small size.

00:05:37.406 --> 00:05:38.946 A:middle
And in general, try avoiding

00:05:38.946 --> 00:05:40.476 A:middle
extremes of weight or style.

00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:42.006 A:middle
A good reading experience is

00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:42.786 A:middle
usually the one you don't

00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:43.176 A:middle
notice.

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:46.246 A:middle
For display, you have more

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:46.646 A:middle
freedom.

00:05:47.406 --> 00:05:48.406 A:middle
This is the right place to use

00:05:48.406 --> 00:05:49.936 A:middle
the more extreme weights or

00:05:49.936 --> 00:05:50.766 A:middle
decorative styles.

00:05:51.446 --> 00:05:52.916 A:middle
Even in display though, stay

00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:54.006 A:middle
aware of spacing.

00:05:54.586 --> 00:05:55.956 A:middle
A headline usually looks better

00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:56.816 A:middle
if it's tightly spaced.

00:05:59.496 --> 00:06:00.686 A:middle
Alright, now let's talk about

00:06:00.686 --> 00:06:01.486 A:middle
what everyone is really

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:02.776 A:middle
interested in, style.

00:06:03.786 --> 00:06:04.886 A:middle
Becoming better at selecting

00:06:04.946 --> 00:06:06.426 A:middle
fonts as with most things,

00:06:06.426 --> 00:06:07.296 A:middle
requires practice.

00:06:07.706 --> 00:06:08.896 A:middle
There's a lot of stuff to learn

00:06:08.896 --> 00:06:10.016 A:middle
and it's perfectly normal to

00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:11.036 A:middle
feel overwhelmed at first.

00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:13.336 A:middle
But there's really only one way

00:06:13.336 --> 00:06:13.846 A:middle
forward.

00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:15.356 A:middle
You need to learn how style

00:06:15.356 --> 00:06:16.356 A:middle
produces an impression.

00:06:18.296 --> 00:06:19.236 A:middle
Remember that app I called

00:06:19.276 --> 00:06:20.706 A:middle
sophisticated in my intro?

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:22.706 A:middle
Well, I picked that term but

00:06:22.706 --> 00:06:24.126 A:middle
it's by no means a universal

00:06:24.126 --> 00:06:24.846 A:middle
qualification.

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:28.216 A:middle
What style conveys is strongly

00:06:28.326 --> 00:06:29.756 A:middle
tied to subjectivity, and will

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:31.166 A:middle
vary from one person to another.

00:06:31.946 --> 00:06:33.076 A:middle
There is one thing you can learn

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:34.686 A:middle
about though, and that is what

00:06:34.746 --> 00:06:36.476 A:middle
people come to associate with a

00:06:36.476 --> 00:06:37.076 A:middle
given style.

00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:38.546 A:middle
In other words, their

00:06:38.546 --> 00:06:39.356 A:middle
expectations.

00:06:40.156 --> 00:06:41.306 A:middle
So, let's look at the type face

00:06:41.306 --> 00:06:42.346 A:middle
used for the name of the app,

00:06:42.516 --> 00:06:42.806 A:middle
Cochin.

00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:45.476 A:middle
The style itself is called

00:06:45.476 --> 00:06:46.796 A:middle
transitional old style.

00:06:47.506 --> 00:06:48.596 A:middle
Most of you probably never heard

00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:50.096 A:middle
of it, but you've likely been

00:06:50.096 --> 00:06:51.626 A:middle
exposed to it in books and/or

00:06:51.626 --> 00:06:52.166 A:middle
magazines.

00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:55.066 A:middle
Cochin has very small, lowercase

00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:56.116 A:middle
letters compared to the upper

00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:56.556 A:middle
case.

00:06:56.706 --> 00:06:58.246 A:middle
This gives a classic appearance,

00:06:58.946 --> 00:07:00.476 A:middle
which will feel elegant to a lot

00:07:00.476 --> 00:07:00.946 A:middle
of people.

00:07:01.836 --> 00:07:03.046 A:middle
But these proportions also

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:04.616 A:middle
happen to be exaggerated, and

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:05.466 A:middle
that makes it feel a bit

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:05.986 A:middle
whimsical.

00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:09.096 A:middle
The companion to Cochin, Snell

00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:10.616 A:middle
Roundhand, is a design mimicking

00:07:10.616 --> 00:07:11.116 A:middle
calligraphy.

00:07:11.116 --> 00:07:13.016 A:middle
And you don't have to be a

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.256 A:middle
calligrapher to get a sense of

00:07:14.256 --> 00:07:15.686 A:middle
how much skill this calligraphic

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:16.406 A:middle
style demands.

00:07:17.466 --> 00:07:18.456 A:middle
It's elaborate structure and

00:07:18.516 --> 00:07:19.766 A:middle
high contrast, lends some

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:20.966 A:middle
preciousness to this design.

00:07:21.856 --> 00:07:24.106 A:middle
So, if I round them up, I have

00:07:24.106 --> 00:07:26.146 A:middle
elegant, whimsical, elaborate,

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:26.826 A:middle
and precious.

00:07:27.106 --> 00:07:28.306 A:middle
How's that for sophistication?

00:07:29.956 --> 00:07:32.076 A:middle
So, why now would this feel

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:32.756 A:middle
literary?

00:07:33.676 --> 00:07:35.016 A:middle
The two typefaces we're looking

00:07:35.016 --> 00:07:36.446 A:middle
at right now, although there is

00:07:36.446 --> 00:07:38.336 A:middle
a display, and a textile, both

00:07:38.336 --> 00:07:39.646 A:middle
have typical features of a

00:07:39.646 --> 00:07:40.706 A:middle
classical book face.

00:07:42.236 --> 00:07:43.406 A:middle
That's why we feel inclined to

00:07:43.406 --> 00:07:44.826 A:middle
look at this choice as literary.

00:07:45.536 --> 00:07:47.916 A:middle
But that kind of association is

00:07:47.916 --> 00:07:49.546 A:middle
not natural at all.

00:07:49.546 --> 00:07:50.696 A:middle
It just comes from the fact that

00:07:50.696 --> 00:07:52.266 A:middle
most of us have been exposed to

00:07:52.266 --> 00:07:53.496 A:middle
those styles in books.

00:07:54.896 --> 00:07:56.276 A:middle
To complete this brief study in

00:07:56.356 --> 00:07:57.926 A:middle
style, I'd like to look at the

00:07:57.926 --> 00:07:59.196 A:middle
fame and crazed geometric

00:07:59.196 --> 00:07:59.846 A:middle
sans-serif.

00:08:00.536 --> 00:08:01.946 A:middle
This is a great example of how

00:08:01.946 --> 00:08:03.456 A:middle
the feel of a typographic style

00:08:03.456 --> 00:08:05.346 A:middle
comes both from form and usage.

00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:07.326 A:middle
The first appeal of that style

00:08:07.326 --> 00:08:08.856 A:middle
is probably -- it's very simple,

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:10.686 A:middle
geometry, and I'll venture into

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:12.126 A:middle
saying that we've seen renewed

00:08:12.126 --> 00:08:13.546 A:middle
interest recently in that style

00:08:13.856 --> 00:08:14.966 A:middle
because of our current design

00:08:14.966 --> 00:08:16.316 A:middle
infatuation with simplicity.

00:08:18.076 --> 00:08:19.696 A:middle
But because this style is all

00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:20.746 A:middle
over the place right now, you

00:08:20.746 --> 00:08:21.976 A:middle
may be inclined to think that it

00:08:21.976 --> 00:08:23.186 A:middle
feels very contemporary and

00:08:23.256 --> 00:08:23.656 A:middle
fresh.

00:08:24.556 --> 00:08:25.976 A:middle
But the nerd in me disagrees.

00:08:27.286 --> 00:08:28.676 A:middle
This style is almost 100 years

00:08:28.676 --> 00:08:28.986 A:middle
old.

00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:30.316 A:middle
And don't get me wrong, I love

00:08:30.316 --> 00:08:32.236 A:middle
old stuff, but I just won't call

00:08:32.236 --> 00:08:32.806 A:middle
it fresh.

00:08:33.766 --> 00:08:35.296 A:middle
But that's the beauty of style.

00:08:35.356 --> 00:08:37.276 A:middle
It has many layers, and new

00:08:37.276 --> 00:08:38.326 A:middle
layers of meaning get added

00:08:38.386 --> 00:08:39.056 A:middle
constantly.

00:08:39.866 --> 00:08:41.196 A:middle
To become better at picking font

00:08:41.196 --> 00:08:42.866 A:middle
styles, you need to become aware

00:08:42.866 --> 00:08:44.556 A:middle
of those layers, old and new.

00:08:47.336 --> 00:08:49.546 A:middle
So, with our growing knowledge

00:08:49.546 --> 00:08:51.096 A:middle
of typographic style, let's look

00:08:51.096 --> 00:08:52.356 A:middle
at a few strategies to pair

00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:52.716 A:middle
fonts.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.816 A:middle
Note the use of the verb "pair"

00:08:54.816 --> 00:08:55.086 A:middle
here.

00:08:55.276 --> 00:08:56.746 A:middle
There is no rule against using

00:08:56.746 --> 00:08:58.416 A:middle
more than two typefaces, but

00:08:58.416 --> 00:08:59.356 A:middle
trust me, you're better off

00:08:59.356 --> 00:09:00.106 A:middle
starting small.

00:09:00.586 --> 00:09:02.166 A:middle
You can always add style later

00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:03.286 A:middle
on if you really need them.

00:09:04.846 --> 00:09:05.966 A:middle
The first point I'd like to make

00:09:06.016 --> 00:09:07.416 A:middle
here, is about the impact of

00:09:07.486 --> 00:09:09.016 A:middle
proportions when pairing fonts.

00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:12.426 A:middle
Let's imagine for a moment, you

00:09:12.486 --> 00:09:13.946 A:middle
have to design an app for WWSC,

00:09:13.946 --> 00:09:16.526 A:middle
the Worldwide Sign Painters

00:09:16.526 --> 00:09:17.016 A:middle
Conference.

00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:19.316 A:middle
You start off nice and easy with

00:09:19.316 --> 00:09:21.186 A:middle
this system font, but we're

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.666 A:middle
missing that sign paintery-vibe.

00:09:23.366 --> 00:09:24.836 A:middle
So, we go back to the font menu

00:09:25.076 --> 00:09:26.876 A:middle
and I kid you not, there's a

00:09:26.956 --> 00:09:28.236 A:middle
sign painter typeface in there.

00:09:29.456 --> 00:09:30.496 A:middle
Sounds like a perfect match,

00:09:30.496 --> 00:09:30.736 A:middle
right?

00:09:32.626 --> 00:09:35.526 A:middle
Well, I should mention that us

00:09:35.646 --> 00:09:36.816 A:middle
type nerds have a term for that

00:09:36.816 --> 00:09:37.376 A:middle
situation.

00:09:39.376 --> 00:09:40.976 A:middle
When someone picks a typeface by

00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:43.006 A:middle
its name, we call that an LTypI,

00:09:43.006 --> 00:09:44.656 A:middle
or Lack of Typographic

00:09:44.656 --> 00:09:45.286 A:middle
Imagination.

00:09:46.806 --> 00:09:48.276 A:middle
There's nothing wrong with it,

00:09:48.516 --> 00:09:49.666 A:middle
but picking feature out just

00:09:49.666 --> 00:09:50.586 A:middle
because your app is about the

00:09:50.586 --> 00:09:51.856 A:middle
future might be too much of a

00:09:51.856 --> 00:09:52.346 A:middle
shortcut.

00:09:53.166 --> 00:09:54.446 A:middle
So, if you're going to pick it,

00:09:54.796 --> 00:09:56.246 A:middle
make sure it's because the style

00:09:56.246 --> 00:09:57.906 A:middle
is appropriate and it serves its

00:09:57.906 --> 00:09:59.536 A:middle
functional purpose.

00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:00.976 A:middle
At the end of the day, a

00:10:00.976 --> 00:10:01.746 A:middle
[inaudible] should really just

00:10:01.796 --> 00:10:02.986 A:middle
be the cherry on top of the

00:10:02.986 --> 00:10:03.246 A:middle
cake.

00:10:04.276 --> 00:10:06.126 A:middle
So, back to this cherry, I'll

00:10:06.126 --> 00:10:07.116 A:middle
risk offending a few of my

00:10:07.116 --> 00:10:07.616 A:middle
peers.

00:10:09.956 --> 00:10:11.286 A:middle
You start working on a schedule

00:10:11.286 --> 00:10:12.946 A:middle
for the event, and you decide to

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.076 A:middle
use both fonts for typographic

00:10:15.076 --> 00:10:16.756 A:middle
contrast, SF and sign painter.

00:10:17.866 --> 00:10:19.106 A:middle
But something's off.

00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:20.696 A:middle
The title's look smaller.

00:10:21.546 --> 00:10:22.896 A:middle
And to make them look matched,

00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:24.216 A:middle
we'll have to increase the point

00:10:24.216 --> 00:10:25.546 A:middle
size on that sign painter style.

00:10:26.586 --> 00:10:27.716 A:middle
Now, where does this difference

00:10:27.756 --> 00:10:28.136 A:middle
come from?

00:10:30.036 --> 00:10:31.556 A:middle
Type designers draw glyphs

00:10:31.596 --> 00:10:32.776 A:middle
within the bounds of a virtual

00:10:32.776 --> 00:10:34.416 A:middle
box called a font body.

00:10:35.326 --> 00:10:36.706 A:middle
Inside this box, proportion will

00:10:36.706 --> 00:10:38.106 A:middle
vary from one design to another.

00:10:39.656 --> 00:10:41.646 A:middle
The height of a font's body is

00:10:41.646 --> 00:10:42.856 A:middle
what is referred to as the point

00:10:42.886 --> 00:10:43.106 A:middle
size.

00:10:43.656 --> 00:10:45.526 A:middle
So, at the same point size, two

00:10:45.526 --> 00:10:46.516 A:middle
fonts can appear to have

00:10:46.776 --> 00:10:48.096 A:middle
different scales because of

00:10:48.096 --> 00:10:48.506 A:middle
their design.

00:10:49.726 --> 00:10:51.036 A:middle
Let me show you how this could

00:10:51.036 --> 00:10:51.676 A:middle
be relevant.

00:10:53.756 --> 00:10:54.736 A:middle
Let's say you're working on a

00:10:54.736 --> 00:10:55.356 A:middle
dictionary app.

00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:57.426 A:middle
Dictionaries require a lot of

00:10:57.426 --> 00:10:59.256 A:middle
typographic hierarchy, and using

00:10:59.256 --> 00:11:01.296 A:middle
only the weights and italics of

00:11:01.336 --> 00:11:01.836 A:middle
a [inaudible] might not be

00:11:01.836 --> 00:11:02.116 A:middle
enough.

00:11:02.886 --> 00:11:03.826 A:middle
You have those descriptives

00:11:03.826 --> 00:11:04.856 A:middle
stand out, for instance.

00:11:05.906 --> 00:11:07.306 A:middle
So, we decide to go look for a

00:11:07.306 --> 00:11:08.546 A:middle
serif typeface to create

00:11:08.546 --> 00:11:09.586 A:middle
typographic contrast.

00:11:10.426 --> 00:11:11.686 A:middle
And to try and avoid to tweak

00:11:11.686 --> 00:11:12.936 A:middle
point sizes left and right,

00:11:12.996 --> 00:11:14.396 A:middle
let's find a serif typeface that

00:11:14.396 --> 00:11:15.736 A:middle
has close proportions to the

00:11:15.736 --> 00:11:17.346 A:middle
[inaudible].

00:11:17.346 --> 00:11:18.836 A:middle
This is easily done by setting

00:11:18.836 --> 00:11:20.116 A:middle
all candidates side by side.

00:11:20.116 --> 00:11:21.426 A:middle
They're the same point size and

00:11:21.426 --> 00:11:22.806 A:middle
evaluating their apparent scale.

00:11:23.686 --> 00:11:24.776 A:middle
There is nothing wrong with

00:11:24.816 --> 00:11:26.546 A:middle
picking a typeface of smaller or

00:11:26.546 --> 00:11:28.406 A:middle
greater scale, but just bear in

00:11:28.406 --> 00:11:29.436 A:middle
mind that you'll have to adjust

00:11:29.516 --> 00:11:31.116 A:middle
point size if you go with that

00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:31.436 A:middle
twice.

00:11:32.056 --> 00:11:33.166 A:middle
So, let's make our life easier

00:11:33.166 --> 00:11:34.326 A:middle
here and look for the closest

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:34.936 A:middle
match available.

00:11:35.536 --> 00:11:36.316 A:middle
And we have a winner.

00:11:37.156 --> 00:11:39.166 A:middle
Now, bringing that back in our

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:41.096 A:middle
layout, we introduce typographic

00:11:41.096 --> 00:11:43.536 A:middle
contrast, and we're done.

00:11:43.846 --> 00:11:45.196 A:middle
No need to tweak point sizes.

00:11:46.096 --> 00:11:46.886 A:middle
If you're worried that this

00:11:46.886 --> 00:11:47.786 A:middle
approach might limit your

00:11:47.786 --> 00:11:49.426 A:middle
stylistic options, please don't.

00:11:50.016 --> 00:11:51.056 A:middle
There are thousands of good

00:11:51.116 --> 00:11:52.506 A:middle
typefaces out there, and quite a

00:11:52.506 --> 00:11:53.806 A:middle
few type designers release from

00:11:53.806 --> 00:11:55.486 A:middle
families, with multiple styles

00:11:55.726 --> 00:11:56.966 A:middle
of consistent proportions.

00:11:59.526 --> 00:12:00.946 A:middle
So, let's now experiment a bit

00:12:01.046 --> 00:12:02.806 A:middle
with pairing text and display

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:03.176 A:middle
styles.

00:12:03.846 --> 00:12:05.456 A:middle
So, let's start nice and easy

00:12:05.456 --> 00:12:06.836 A:middle
again with a [inaudible] in a

00:12:06.836 --> 00:12:07.856 A:middle
news story layout.

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:09.896 A:middle
This typographic layout has

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:11.516 A:middle
strong stylistic continuity.

00:12:11.746 --> 00:12:13.106 A:middle
The only difference between text

00:12:13.106 --> 00:12:14.846 A:middle
and headline, are size and the

00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:15.616 A:middle
use of italics.

00:12:16.686 --> 00:12:17.896 A:middle
But we might be after something

00:12:17.896 --> 00:12:18.956 A:middle
with a bit more of a punch.

00:12:19.886 --> 00:12:21.626 A:middle
And the first way to get there,

00:12:21.726 --> 00:12:23.066 A:middle
the easiest way to get there, is

00:12:23.066 --> 00:12:24.006 A:middle
to first leverage weight.

00:12:25.186 --> 00:12:26.586 A:middle
Sticking to a single typeface

00:12:26.586 --> 00:12:27.896 A:middle
and pairing some of its variant,

00:12:27.896 --> 00:12:29.306 A:middle
is a very efficient way to

00:12:29.306 --> 00:12:30.536 A:middle
achieve design consistency.

00:12:31.426 --> 00:12:32.196 A:middle
But since we're here to

00:12:32.196 --> 00:12:33.796 A:middle
experiment, let's keep on trying

00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:34.076 A:middle
things.

00:12:37.126 --> 00:12:38.376 A:middle
We now change the kind of

00:12:38.476 --> 00:12:40.116 A:middle
typographic contrast from a

00:12:40.116 --> 00:12:41.766 A:middle
weight difference to a stylistic

00:12:41.766 --> 00:12:42.336 A:middle
difference.

00:12:42.696 --> 00:12:43.616 A:middle
When doing these kind of

00:12:43.706 --> 00:12:45.056 A:middle
pairings, make sure that the

00:12:45.106 --> 00:12:46.576 A:middle
stylistic difference is strong

00:12:46.576 --> 00:12:47.836 A:middle
enough to be obvious.

00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:50.516 A:middle
Here we have two typestyles of

00:12:50.516 --> 00:12:52.166 A:middle
both different structures, and

00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:54.056 A:middle
stroke contrast, so we're in a

00:12:54.056 --> 00:12:54.516 A:middle
good place.

00:12:57.346 --> 00:12:58.986 A:middle
By the way, it is sometimes good

00:12:58.986 --> 00:13:00.826 A:middle
enough to have a strong display

00:13:00.826 --> 00:13:03.596 A:middle
typeface and using the system

00:13:03.636 --> 00:13:04.596 A:middle
font at the same time.

00:13:05.086 --> 00:13:06.366 A:middle
You're defining your own style,

00:13:06.416 --> 00:13:08.136 A:middle
but also taking advantage of

00:13:08.366 --> 00:13:09.176 A:middle
[inaudible] performance as a

00:13:09.176 --> 00:13:10.356 A:middle
typographic workhorse.

00:13:12.716 --> 00:13:13.916 A:middle
But let's keep on experimenting

00:13:13.916 --> 00:13:14.336 A:middle
anyway.

00:13:14.556 --> 00:13:15.736 A:middle
I think I'd like to use a serif

00:13:15.736 --> 00:13:17.876 A:middle
typeface down there.

00:13:18.836 --> 00:13:20.426 A:middle
We return to an understated and

00:13:20.496 --> 00:13:21.856 A:middle
calm effect like we had in the

00:13:21.856 --> 00:13:23.206 A:middle
beginning, but with a quite

00:13:23.206 --> 00:13:23.856 A:middle
different flavor.

00:13:24.696 --> 00:13:26.246 A:middle
This will now feel more bookish

00:13:26.246 --> 00:13:27.546 A:middle
because of the type choice, but

00:13:27.546 --> 00:13:28.776 A:middle
also because of the subdued

00:13:28.776 --> 00:13:30.486 A:middle
relationship between display and

00:13:30.536 --> 00:13:30.746 A:middle
text.

00:13:31.496 --> 00:13:33.016 A:middle
Books tend to go from

00:13:33.016 --> 00:13:34.186 A:middle
[inaudible] typographic contrast

00:13:34.186 --> 00:13:35.436 A:middle
because they're about long

00:13:35.436 --> 00:13:36.886 A:middle
reading, and of grabbing your

00:13:36.886 --> 00:13:37.596 A:middle
attention all the time.

00:13:38.476 --> 00:13:40.096 A:middle
On the other hand, a news layout

00:13:40.146 --> 00:13:41.776 A:middle
may be more [inaudible] this.

00:13:42.596 --> 00:13:44.236 A:middle
Here we're using san serif for

00:13:44.236 --> 00:13:46.006 A:middle
both display and textiles, but

00:13:46.056 --> 00:13:47.486 A:middle
their structuring weights are so

00:13:47.486 --> 00:13:49.096 A:middle
different that we still maintain

00:13:49.156 --> 00:13:50.616 A:middle
clear and strong typographic

00:13:50.616 --> 00:13:51.006 A:middle
contrast.

00:13:51.856 --> 00:13:53.066 A:middle
The display style grabbed your

00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:54.566 A:middle
attention, provides context,

00:13:54.926 --> 00:13:55.816 A:middle
this is what you're about to

00:13:55.816 --> 00:13:57.696 A:middle
read, and makes the layout look

00:13:57.696 --> 00:13:59.696 A:middle
appealing and then the textile

00:13:59.816 --> 00:14:01.166 A:middle
will let you read the content

00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:02.226 A:middle
with ease and without

00:14:02.226 --> 00:14:02.726 A:middle
disruption.

00:14:04.896 --> 00:14:05.976 A:middle
So, as you've now seen, there's

00:14:05.976 --> 00:14:07.466 A:middle
obviously a lot you can do in

00:14:07.516 --> 00:14:08.486 A:middle
terms of style pairing.

00:14:08.586 --> 00:14:09.666 A:middle
And I've only given you a

00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:11.006 A:middle
glimpse of the possibilities of

00:14:11.036 --> 00:14:11.296 A:middle
course.

00:14:12.116 --> 00:14:13.486 A:middle
The key element is typographic

00:14:13.486 --> 00:14:13.986 A:middle
contrast.

00:14:14.336 --> 00:14:15.476 A:middle
Whether I did it through size,

00:14:15.756 --> 00:14:16.876 A:middle
weight, or style.

00:14:17.846 --> 00:14:18.966 A:middle
Finally, if you want to become

00:14:18.966 --> 00:14:20.356 A:middle
better at picking fonts, there

00:14:20.356 --> 00:14:21.806 A:middle
is really no way around learning

00:14:21.806 --> 00:14:23.246 A:middle
more about typographic styles,

00:14:23.516 --> 00:14:24.766 A:middle
their histories, and evolving

00:14:24.766 --> 00:14:25.096 A:middle
trends.

00:14:26.106 --> 00:14:27.236 A:middle
This is how you'll become more

00:14:27.236 --> 00:14:28.506 A:middle
confident in front of that font

00:14:28.506 --> 00:14:28.846 A:middle
menu.

00:14:29.496 --> 00:14:30.726 A:middle
And don't worry, you won't

00:14:30.726 --> 00:14:31.896 A:middle
become typographic rock stars

00:14:31.896 --> 00:14:32.426 A:middle
overnight.

00:14:32.946 --> 00:14:34.306 A:middle
And yes, that's a thing.

00:14:35.276 --> 00:14:36.616 A:middle
But at least you know where to

00:14:36.616 --> 00:14:37.066 A:middle
start.

00:14:37.166 --> 00:14:38.446 A:middle
And I have no doubt that you'll

00:14:38.516 --> 00:14:39.636 A:middle
soon grow into tremendous

00:14:39.666 --> 00:14:40.786 A:middle
typographers yourself.

00:14:41.386 --> 00:14:42.266 A:middle
Thank you.
