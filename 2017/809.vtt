00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:22.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Whether you're a designer or

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.816 A:middle
engineer, we all want our apps

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.226 A:middle
to look and feel amazing.

00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:28.346 A:middle
We want our code to be flawless,

00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:30.096 A:middle
our assets to be pixel perfect,

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.846 A:middle
and our store ratings to be five

00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:33.096 A:middle
stars nothing less.

00:00:34.646 --> 00:00:36.656 A:middle
But let's talk about reality.

00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:39.956 A:middle
As a designer you're focused on

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:41.316 A:middle
creating delightful interfaces

00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:42.096 A:middle
and experiences.

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:44.946 A:middle
As an engineer you're focused on

00:00:44.946 --> 00:00:46.386 A:middle
making sure you code works and

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:47.156 A:middle
nothing breaks.

00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:49.496 A:middle
As a result the process becomes

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:51.126 A:middle
slow and everyone feels

00:00:51.126 --> 00:00:51.656 A:middle
frustrated.

00:00:52.296 --> 00:00:53.646 A:middle
It's friction we don't need.

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:56.246 A:middle
In the next 10 minutes we're

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.976 A:middle
going to look at four things

00:00:58.276 --> 00:00:59.086 A:middle
that will really help make

00:00:59.086 --> 00:00:59.596 A:middle
difference.

00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:00.966 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:01:02.756 --> 00:01:04.256 A:middle
The first is using the same

00:01:04.256 --> 00:01:04.886 A:middle
terminology.

00:01:06.326 --> 00:01:08.156 A:middle
This saves time, eliminates

00:01:08.156 --> 00:01:09.656 A:middle
confusion, and increases

00:01:09.656 --> 00:01:11.106 A:middle
credibility with your team and

00:01:11.106 --> 00:01:11.636 A:middle
clients.

00:01:13.196 --> 00:01:14.396 A:middle
Let's look at some examples of

00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:15.506 A:middle
how using different terms

00:01:15.506 --> 00:01:16.826 A:middle
amongst team members can create

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:17.746 A:middle
confusion down the road.

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:20.656 A:middle
All right, pop quiz time.

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:22.356 A:middle
By a show of hands, which of the

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:23.676 A:middle
following is the right term for

00:01:23.676 --> 00:01:26.276 A:middle
this piece of UI -- Is it a

00:01:26.276 --> 00:01:28.266 A:middle
pop-up?

00:01:28.516 --> 00:01:29.226 A:middle
Popover? Modal?

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:31.536 A:middle
Wow you guys are good.

00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:36.706 A:middle
And the right answer is none of

00:01:36.706 --> 00:01:36.936 A:middle
them.

00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:40.366 A:middle
The correct term is UI Alert

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.796 A:middle
Controller or more currently

00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:42.666 A:middle
called an Alert.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:45.476 A:middle
All right, another show of

00:01:45.476 --> 00:01:45.766 A:middle
hands.

00:01:46.086 --> 00:01:47.116 A:middle
Which of the following is the

00:01:47.116 --> 00:01:49.336 A:middle
right term for this bar -- Is it

00:01:49.436 --> 00:01:50.126 A:middle
a Header?

00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:54.606 A:middle
Top Tool Bar?

00:01:55.226 --> 00:01:55.976 A:middle
Navigation Bar?

00:01:57.576 --> 00:02:01.516 A:middle
The actual term is Navigation

00:02:01.516 --> 00:02:01.806 A:middle
Bar.

00:02:04.076 --> 00:02:05.756 A:middle
All right and what do we call

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:06.436 A:middle
this bar?

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.536 A:middle
Is it a Drawer?

00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:14.236 A:middle
Tool Bar? Bottom Navigation Bar?

00:02:16.176 --> 00:02:18.786 A:middle
The right term is Tool Bar.

00:02:19.256 --> 00:02:21.146 A:middle
All right last one, show of

00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:21.466 A:middle
hands.

00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:22.446 A:middle
Which of the following is the

00:02:22.446 --> 00:02:23.586 A:middle
right term for this control?

00:02:23.786 --> 00:02:25.146 A:middle
Is it a Switch?

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.396 A:middle
Is it a Toggle?

00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:30.076 A:middle
Is it a On-Off Slider?

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:34.056 A:middle
No? The actual term would be

00:02:34.246 --> 00:02:34.796 A:middle
Switch.

00:02:35.816 --> 00:02:37.976 A:middle
So these are just some of the

00:02:37.976 --> 00:02:38.906 A:middle
elements that have been called

00:02:38.906 --> 00:02:39.836 A:middle
different things by different

00:02:39.836 --> 00:02:40.186 A:middle
people.

00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:41.496 A:middle
I am sure most of you have

00:02:41.496 --> 00:02:42.956 A:middle
experienced moments where you

00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:43.986 A:middle
have had a performance stream of

00:02:43.986 --> 00:02:45.346 A:middle
mental translations when someone

00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:47.676 A:middle
asks you to implement a Toggle

00:02:47.676 --> 00:02:52.366 A:middle
and the modal trigger a pop-up.

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:53.876 A:middle
Adopting mutually understood

00:02:53.876 --> 00:02:55.446 A:middle
terminology is so important to

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:56.586 A:middle
eliminating confusion and

00:02:56.586 --> 00:02:57.256 A:middle
frustration.

00:02:58.166 --> 00:02:59.516 A:middle
It's like you said cup, when you

00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:00.796 A:middle
really meant this kind of cup.

00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:03.506 A:middle
You want to agree on terminology

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:04.806 A:middle
that doesn't require additional

00:03:04.806 --> 00:03:06.016 A:middle
brain cycles to interpret down

00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:06.336 A:middle
the road.

00:03:07.346 --> 00:03:08.546 A:middle
So here are some quick

00:03:08.546 --> 00:03:09.846 A:middle
activities that you can try with

00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:10.836 A:middle
your team to reach that goal.

00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:14.436 A:middle
Take 30 minutes with your team

00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:15.386 A:middle
or client to do an app

00:03:15.556 --> 00:03:16.876 A:middle
postmortem, just focusing on

00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:17.346 A:middle
terms.

00:03:18.626 --> 00:03:19.736 A:middle
Make it fun, turn it into a

00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:20.456 A:middle
Pictionary game.

00:03:20.996 --> 00:03:23.636 A:middle
Put things up on a whiteboard

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.176 A:middle
and spend 20 seconds doing flash

00:03:25.176 --> 00:03:25.826 A:middle
reactions to it.

00:03:26.876 --> 00:03:28.866 A:middle
And for the more formal minded,

00:03:29.206 --> 00:03:30.696 A:middle
create a report showing all the

00:03:30.696 --> 00:03:32.026 A:middle
breakdowns due to terminology

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:32.526 A:middle
confusion.

00:03:34.136 --> 00:03:35.536 A:middle
Developer to Apple.com is a

00:03:35.536 --> 00:03:36.926 A:middle
great resource for referencing

00:03:36.926 --> 00:03:38.766 A:middle
standard terminology whether in

00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:40.206 A:middle
the Human Interface Guidelines

00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:41.356 A:middle
or in the API Reference

00:03:41.356 --> 00:03:42.136 A:middle
Documentation.

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:45.116 A:middle
All right, the second thing I

00:03:45.116 --> 00:03:46.556 A:middle
want to talk about is having one

00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:47.186 A:middle
source of truth.

00:03:48.376 --> 00:03:49.716 A:middle
Ever been in a situation where

00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:50.776 A:middle
you've had to pull mockups from

00:03:50.776 --> 00:03:52.346 A:middle
a server, stings from a Project

00:03:52.346 --> 00:03:53.926 A:middle
Wiki and then doing like a last

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:55.906 A:middle
minute asset swap send via email

00:03:56.596 --> 00:03:58.406 A:middle
or coming back to an old project

00:03:58.406 --> 00:03:59.296 A:middle
and not knowing which is the

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:02.616 A:middle
right version to open.

00:04:02.736 --> 00:04:03.976 A:middle
Hashtag designer life.

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:09.686 A:middle
[ Audience Laughing ]

00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:11.946 A:middle
What if you and your team or

00:04:11.946 --> 00:04:13.836 A:middle
client could agree before hand a

00:04:13.936 --> 00:04:15.116 A:middle
single place where all of the

00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:16.586 A:middle
approved deliverables can be

00:04:16.586 --> 00:04:17.086 A:middle
accessed.

00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:18.806 A:middle
This would ensure that everyone

00:04:18.806 --> 00:04:20.276 A:middle
knows where to go to check out

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:21.136 A:middle
the necessary assets.

00:04:22.776 --> 00:04:23.996 A:middle
Unfortunately designers don't

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:25.566 A:middle
have similarly universal options

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:26.846 A:middle
as engineers currently do with

00:04:26.846 --> 00:04:28.116 A:middle
their IDE's and Version Control.

00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:31.106 A:middle
There's an increasing number of

00:04:31.106 --> 00:04:32.106 A:middle
solutions that have come in the

00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:32.936 A:middle
last few years.

00:04:33.146 --> 00:04:34.336 A:middle
So work with your designers to

00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:35.436 A:middle
find one that integrates with

00:04:35.496 --> 00:04:36.926 A:middle
their tools and yours.

00:04:38.006 --> 00:04:39.716 A:middle
All right, thirdly I want to

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:40.636 A:middle
talk about having very

00:04:40.636 --> 00:04:41.566 A:middle
thoughtful focus.

00:04:43.546 --> 00:04:44.086 A:middle
Let's be real.

00:04:44.586 --> 00:04:45.606 A:middle
There's an inherent desire to

00:04:45.606 --> 00:04:47.516 A:middle
start customizing your UI so you

00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:48.196 A:middle
can stand out from your

00:04:48.196 --> 00:04:48.816 A:middle
competition.

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:50.676 A:middle
But have you stopped to consider

00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:51.726 A:middle
the big picture first?

00:04:52.216 --> 00:04:54.836 A:middle
When designing and developing an

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.416 A:middle
app, you're creating a system

00:04:56.576 --> 00:04:57.676 A:middle
and systems have a lot of

00:04:57.676 --> 00:04:59.036 A:middle
complexity where everything is

00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:00.696 A:middle
interrelated and interdependent.

00:05:01.436 --> 00:05:03.706 A:middle
It requires all of us to think

00:05:03.706 --> 00:05:05.916 A:middle
deeply into all the use cases,

00:05:06.316 --> 00:05:07.376 A:middle
balancing that against your

00:05:07.486 --> 00:05:10.286 A:middle
time, skill, and other system

00:05:10.286 --> 00:05:11.186 A:middle
resource constraints.

00:05:11.406 --> 00:05:13.406 A:middle
It helps if you start from a

00:05:13.406 --> 00:05:14.416 A:middle
place of familiarity.

00:05:14.936 --> 00:05:17.496 A:middle
Just as most of you are more

00:05:17.496 --> 00:05:18.696 A:middle
familiar with cooking using a

00:05:18.696 --> 00:05:20.016 A:middle
non-stick pan, rather than

00:05:20.016 --> 00:05:21.146 A:middle
something more specialized like

00:05:21.146 --> 00:05:22.976 A:middle
a tandoor oven, starting with

00:05:22.976 --> 00:05:24.466 A:middle
standard patterns and resources

00:05:24.626 --> 00:05:25.926 A:middle
you get for free in the SDK

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.326 A:middle
helps to speed up the entire

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:27.896 A:middle
process.

00:05:28.716 --> 00:05:30.716 A:middle
Here's an example of a standard

00:05:30.716 --> 00:05:31.066 A:middle
table.

00:05:32.646 --> 00:05:33.826 A:middle
Starting with a standard table

00:05:33.826 --> 00:05:35.216 A:middle
view with this accompanying

00:05:35.216 --> 00:05:36.566 A:middle
disclosure indicator accessory,

00:05:37.096 --> 00:05:38.076 A:middle
would free up time to work on

00:05:38.076 --> 00:05:39.336 A:middle
ensuring that the implementation

00:05:39.336 --> 00:05:39.866 A:middle
is stable.

00:05:40.566 --> 00:05:42.416 A:middle
This also ensures that the app

00:05:42.466 --> 00:05:43.936 A:middle
will work with accessibility

00:05:43.936 --> 00:05:45.516 A:middle
features in the OS, which is a

00:05:45.516 --> 00:05:47.226 A:middle
huge plus for many people.

00:05:48.276 --> 00:05:49.636 A:middle
Then when you want to start

00:05:49.636 --> 00:05:51.276 A:middle
creating Custom UI, you'll be in

00:05:51.276 --> 00:05:52.736 A:middle
a more empathetic state of mind

00:05:52.736 --> 00:05:55.376 A:middle
to ask is it worth the effort?

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.906 A:middle
Here are some activities I want

00:05:58.906 --> 00:06:00.056 A:middle
you to do before going down any

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:00.906 A:middle
path.

00:06:02.526 --> 00:06:03.986 A:middle
Thoroughly consider all the

00:06:03.986 --> 00:06:05.446 A:middle
intended and etch use cases.

00:06:06.036 --> 00:06:06.606 A:middle
Write them down.

00:06:07.026 --> 00:06:08.666 A:middle
Better yet do this together with

00:06:08.756 --> 00:06:09.606 A:middle
your team or client.

00:06:11.616 --> 00:06:13.156 A:middle
Find out what resources with the

00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:14.386 A:middle
OS or your tools that come for

00:06:14.386 --> 00:06:15.986 A:middle
free and leverage that as a

00:06:15.986 --> 00:06:17.906 A:middle
starting point and build

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:20.256 A:middle
accessibility considerations up

00:06:20.316 --> 00:06:20.596 A:middle
front.

00:06:21.086 --> 00:06:22.326 A:middle
This will ensure even more

00:06:22.706 --> 00:06:24.566 A:middle
people can enjoy your app.

00:06:25.136 --> 00:06:27.186 A:middle
All right finally I want to talk

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:28.086 A:middle
about show and tell.

00:06:28.676 --> 00:06:33.236 A:middle
Or rather show more than tell.

00:06:33.456 --> 00:06:34.606 A:middle
Designers can be guilty of

00:06:34.606 --> 00:06:36.226 A:middle
throwing static mockups inspects

00:06:36.226 --> 00:06:37.506 A:middle
over to engineers, especially in

00:06:37.506 --> 00:06:38.206 A:middle
a time crunch.

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:39.916 A:middle
Or engineers can blindly

00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:41.286 A:middle
implement the specs without

00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:42.306 A:middle
seeking clarification.

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.106 A:middle
Then when the app is being

00:06:44.106 --> 00:06:45.326 A:middle
reviewed by the team, there's

00:06:45.326 --> 00:06:46.866 A:middle
invariably complaints from the

00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:48.026 A:middle
designer that implementation

00:06:48.026 --> 00:06:49.586 A:middle
didn't match the intent, or

00:06:49.586 --> 00:06:50.566 A:middle
frustration from the engineer

00:06:50.566 --> 00:06:52.306 A:middle
that the spec wasn't detailed

00:06:52.306 --> 00:06:53.386 A:middle
enough to fill in the mental

00:06:53.386 --> 00:06:53.836 A:middle
gaps.

00:06:54.336 --> 00:06:55.776 A:middle
More often than not,

00:06:56.346 --> 00:06:57.756 A:middle
demonstrating with a video or a

00:06:57.756 --> 00:06:59.246 A:middle
small interactive prototype can

00:06:59.246 --> 00:07:00.566 A:middle
be extremely valuable in

00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:02.316 A:middle
communicating the intent or

00:07:02.546 --> 00:07:03.816 A:middle
better yet, sparking a

00:07:03.816 --> 00:07:05.346 A:middle
conversation on constraints,

00:07:05.836 --> 00:07:07.406 A:middle
possible solutions, and next

00:07:07.406 --> 00:07:07.796 A:middle
steps.

00:07:09.616 --> 00:07:10.516 A:middle
Here's an example of an

00:07:10.516 --> 00:07:11.916 A:middle
animation spec for transitioning

00:07:11.916 --> 00:07:13.186 A:middle
into a full screen sketch on the

00:07:13.186 --> 00:07:14.826 A:middle
Notes app, the designer could be

00:07:14.826 --> 00:07:15.796 A:middle
delivering to an engineer.

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:18.566 A:middle
Showing graphical

00:07:18.566 --> 00:07:20.046 A:middle
representations of the curves,

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:21.616 A:middle
the related parameter value

00:07:21.616 --> 00:07:23.826 A:middle
pairs or better yet, the exact

00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:25.306 A:middle
API reference, coupled with a

00:07:25.306 --> 00:07:26.856 A:middle
video of the design animation

00:07:26.856 --> 00:07:27.736 A:middle
will ensure that the

00:07:27.736 --> 00:07:28.996 A:middle
implementation will certainly

00:07:28.996 --> 00:07:29.676 A:middle
match the intent.

00:07:31.316 --> 00:07:32.866 A:middle
Designers, you can do this.

00:07:33.306 --> 00:07:34.526 A:middle
There are powerful prototyping

00:07:34.526 --> 00:07:35.886 A:middle
tools out there like Principle,

00:07:35.886 --> 00:07:37.356 A:middle
Flinto, or even Apple Keynote

00:07:37.736 --> 00:07:39.236 A:middle
that are really easy to use, so

00:07:39.236 --> 00:07:40.296 A:middle
I highly encourage you to try

00:07:40.296 --> 00:07:40.506 A:middle
them.

00:07:41.316 --> 00:07:42.786 A:middle
And if you want to gain extra

00:07:42.786 --> 00:07:43.996 A:middle
credit ability of the engineer,

00:07:44.346 --> 00:07:45.366 A:middle
try using Xcode.

00:07:46.176 --> 00:07:47.846 A:middle
See how engineers use it to

00:07:47.846 --> 00:07:49.206 A:middle
bring your designs to life.

00:07:50.106 --> 00:07:51.316 A:middle
Diving in doesn't even require

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:51.836 A:middle
any coding.

00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:55.016 A:middle
You can open Xcode, select any

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:57.606 A:middle
app option, track your assets

00:07:57.606 --> 00:07:59.016 A:middle
into the asset catalog to see

00:07:59.016 --> 00:08:00.646 A:middle
for example how your app icons

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:01.466 A:middle
will be implemented.

00:08:02.176 --> 00:08:03.526 A:middle
Or try the storyboard feature to

00:08:03.576 --> 00:08:04.706 A:middle
create simple flows.

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:06.816 A:middle
Hint -- you can import your

00:08:06.816 --> 00:08:08.066 A:middle
static mockups in here to create

00:08:08.116 --> 00:08:09.026 A:middle
interactive prototypes.

00:08:09.506 --> 00:08:12.026 A:middle
Use the object liability to see

00:08:12.026 --> 00:08:13.796 A:middle
how built in controls work and

00:08:14.716 --> 00:08:15.586 A:middle
what they're really called.

00:08:17.036 --> 00:08:20.146 A:middle
And look at all these states and

00:08:20.146 --> 00:08:22.126 A:middle
properties for the table view

00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:23.146 A:middle
accessory that UI Kit is

00:08:23.146 --> 00:08:26.296 A:middle
providing for free.

00:08:26.526 --> 00:08:27.846 A:middle
Using the same tool helps build

00:08:27.846 --> 00:08:29.916 A:middle
empathy, keeps you informed, and

00:08:29.916 --> 00:08:31.196 A:middle
thereby build credibility.

00:08:31.526 --> 00:08:32.846 A:middle
It can also initiate

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:33.796 A:middle
conversations that can be

00:08:33.796 --> 00:08:34.996 A:middle
helpful to improving the app

00:08:34.996 --> 00:08:35.906 A:middle
that you're both working on.

00:08:36.826 --> 00:08:38.776 A:middle
So here are some activities I

00:08:38.776 --> 00:08:40.516 A:middle
want you to try with your team.

00:08:41.746 --> 00:08:43.196 A:middle
Set short face-to-face times and

00:08:43.196 --> 00:08:44.016 A:middle
run through your prototypes with

00:08:44.016 --> 00:08:44.416 A:middle
each other.

00:08:46.006 --> 00:08:47.946 A:middle
Use that time to tweak values or

00:08:47.946 --> 00:08:49.056 A:middle
use the opportunity to explore

00:08:49.056 --> 00:08:49.766 A:middle
alternatives.

00:08:51.186 --> 00:08:52.546 A:middle
And schedule feedback sessions

00:08:52.646 --> 00:08:53.696 A:middle
while you're in context.

00:08:53.856 --> 00:08:55.306 A:middle
For example, grab your designer

00:08:55.306 --> 00:08:56.816 A:middle
or engineer teammate while your

00:08:56.816 --> 00:08:58.276 A:middle
project is still open and before

00:08:58.276 --> 00:08:59.136 A:middle
you're about to check in your

00:08:59.536 --> 00:08:59.656 A:middle
work.

00:09:00.146 --> 00:09:01.586 A:middle
Quick timely communication

00:09:01.586 --> 00:09:03.336 A:middle
reduces errors and mitigates

00:09:03.336 --> 00:09:04.906 A:middle
potentially bad situations down

00:09:04.906 --> 00:09:06.416 A:middle
the road when your app is in

00:09:06.416 --> 00:09:07.406 A:middle
your users hands.

00:09:08.676 --> 00:09:11.026 A:middle
So in summary, here are the four

00:09:11.026 --> 00:09:11.946 A:middle
things to start working on --

00:09:13.396 --> 00:09:14.776 A:middle
agree on the same terminology,

00:09:16.286 --> 00:09:17.836 A:middle
decide on a single source where

00:09:17.836 --> 00:09:19.086 A:middle
everyone knows where to post and

00:09:19.086 --> 00:09:21.876 A:middle
check out deliverables, have a

00:09:21.926 --> 00:09:23.696 A:middle
thoughtful focus on use cases,

00:09:24.456 --> 00:09:25.826 A:middle
resource capabilities and

00:09:25.826 --> 00:09:29.126 A:middle
accessibility and demonstrating

00:09:29.126 --> 00:09:30.576 A:middle
with dynamic prototypes rather

00:09:30.576 --> 00:09:31.756 A:middle
than static screenshots.

00:09:32.916 --> 00:09:34.106 A:middle
Doing these four things will

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:34.986 A:middle
really help with infective

00:09:35.026 --> 00:09:35.726 A:middle
communication.

00:09:36.566 --> 00:09:37.676 A:middle
You'll get clarity on what needs

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:38.996 A:middle
to be done and you'll gain

00:09:38.996 --> 00:09:40.196 A:middle
credibility with your team,

00:09:40.766 --> 00:09:42.236 A:middle
client, and users.

00:09:43.186 --> 00:09:43.516 A:middle
Thank you.
