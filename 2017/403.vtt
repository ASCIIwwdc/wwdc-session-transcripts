00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:26.246 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:26.246 --> 00:00:26.476 A:middle
Thank you.

00:00:26.476 --> 00:00:28.966 A:middle
It's good to be here.

00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:31.396 A:middle
We have some very great stuff

00:00:32.586 --> 00:00:35.306 A:middle
for you, today.

00:00:35.516 --> 00:00:38.976 A:middle
Last year we unveiled automatic

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:39.426 A:middle
signing.

00:00:40.076 --> 00:00:40.646 A:middle
And it's great.

00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:43.916 A:middle
Automatic signing was a major

00:00:43.916 --> 00:00:45.536 A:middle
leap forward in the ease of use

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:47.846 A:middle
for how you sign your app.

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.696 A:middle
Today, we're taking the next

00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:51.886 A:middle
step.

00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:53.346 A:middle
We're making it possible to use

00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:54.696 A:middle
automatic signing for

00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:58.276 A:middle
distribution, XCode Build, and

00:00:58.276 --> 00:00:58.976 A:middle
XCode Server.

00:01:01.196 --> 00:01:03.216 A:middle
So, what exactly are we going to

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:05.166 A:middle
talk about, today?

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.616 A:middle
First thing, is I'm going to

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:07.846 A:middle
very briefly review the

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:09.356 A:middle
fundamentals of signing and how

00:01:09.356 --> 00:01:10.586 A:middle
it works on our platforms.

00:01:11.756 --> 00:01:14.166 A:middle
Next, I'm going to show you how

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.186 A:middle
to set up XCode Server to

00:01:16.186 --> 00:01:17.606 A:middle
perform development signing so

00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:19.386 A:middle
that you can regularly run tests

00:01:19.386 --> 00:01:20.126 A:middle
on the device.

00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:23.016 A:middle
Then, I'm going to show you some

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.056 A:middle
of the great changes that we've

00:01:24.056 --> 00:01:25.586 A:middle
been making to manual signing.

00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:28.546 A:middle
Itai is going to come up and

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:29.956 A:middle
show you all of the great

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:31.046 A:middle
changes we've been making to

00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:32.406 A:middle
distribution and distribution

00:01:32.406 --> 00:01:32.786 A:middle
signing.

00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:35.506 A:middle
And Brent will come up to show

00:01:35.506 --> 00:01:37.126 A:middle
you how to set up XCode Server,

00:01:37.126 --> 00:01:38.446 A:middle
and for the first time, perform

00:01:38.446 --> 00:01:39.386 A:middle
distribution signing.

00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:43.676 A:middle
So, before we get in too deep, I

00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:44.726 A:middle
would like to take a moment to

00:01:44.726 --> 00:01:46.076 A:middle
remind us why we do this.

00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:47.186 A:middle
Why do we code sign?

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:50.326 A:middle
Well, the simple answer is that

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:52.386 A:middle
code signing protects us.

00:01:52.496 --> 00:01:54.366 A:middle
It protects us as users, it

00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:55.706 A:middle
protects us as developers.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:57.316 A:middle
And all of us are users.

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:58.926 A:middle
All of us download apps from the

00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:00.456 A:middle
store, and we're sure that, that

00:02:00.456 --> 00:02:01.846 A:middle
app came from the developer that

00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:04.646 A:middle
wrote it, because of code

00:02:04.796 --> 00:02:04.986 A:middle
signing.

00:02:04.986 --> 00:02:06.666 A:middle
And every app that we download

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:09.026 A:middle
from the store, we're sure that

00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:11.306 A:middle
Apple has approved that, that

00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:12.496 A:middle
app is allowed to use special

00:02:12.496 --> 00:02:13.476 A:middle
system services.

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:16.196 A:middle
We can trust the security and

00:02:16.196 --> 00:02:18.196 A:middle
the privacy of our devices

00:02:18.246 --> 00:02:19.246 A:middle
because of code signing.

00:02:19.796 --> 00:02:21.866 A:middle
So, how does this actually work?

00:02:22.616 --> 00:02:23.746 A:middle
Well, every app had a code

00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:24.186 A:middle
signature.

00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:26.166 A:middle
And when the app is run, the

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:27.246 A:middle
system checks for a couple

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:27.606 A:middle
things.

00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:29.046 A:middle
It first checks that, that

00:02:29.046 --> 00:02:30.016 A:middle
signature is valid.

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:31.736 A:middle
That it hasn't been tampered

00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:32.766 A:middle
with since it came from the

00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:33.616 A:middle
original developer.

00:02:34.936 --> 00:02:37.066 A:middle
And that, that app is allowed to

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:38.606 A:middle
use special system services,

00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:39.436 A:middle
like App Groups.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.646 A:middle
And the signature also tells us

00:02:42.756 --> 00:02:43.966 A:middle
if it's been provisioned for

00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:44.636 A:middle
this device.

00:02:44.636 --> 00:02:46.066 A:middle
If it's for development, it's

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:47.736 A:middle
been provisioned for a couple

00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:48.286 A:middle
devices.

00:02:48.286 --> 00:02:49.696 A:middle
And if it's for the App Store,

00:02:50.346 --> 00:02:51.656 A:middle
that code signature says it can

00:02:51.656 --> 00:02:52.616 A:middle
run on any device.

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:55.976 A:middle
Now, composing this signature,

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:58.246 A:middle
XCode uses three essential

00:02:58.246 --> 00:02:58.946 A:middle
ingredients.

00:02:59.416 --> 00:03:01.256 A:middle
Our good friends, the signing

00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:03.426 A:middle
certificate, a provisioning

00:03:03.426 --> 00:03:05.836 A:middle
profile, and entitlements.

00:03:06.996 --> 00:03:08.246 A:middle
Now, I'm going to spare you a

00:03:08.246 --> 00:03:09.786 A:middle
very detailed explanation of how

00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:10.736 A:middle
all of this works.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.496 A:middle
But I would like to refer you to

00:03:13.496 --> 00:03:15.316 A:middle
last year's talk, What's New in

00:03:15.316 --> 00:03:17.026 A:middle
XCode App Signing, where we go

00:03:17.026 --> 00:03:18.506 A:middle
into great detail about how this

00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:19.646 A:middle
works with our platforms.

00:03:19.646 --> 00:03:21.206 A:middle
And how it works with XCode 8.

00:03:21.706 --> 00:03:25.216 A:middle
What I will say is that

00:03:25.796 --> 00:03:27.566 A:middle
collecting all of these assets,

00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:30.246 A:middle
it's not that much fun.

00:03:30.246 --> 00:03:31.136 A:middle
It's complex.

00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:33.946 A:middle
Which is why in XCode 8, we

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:35.366 A:middle
introduced a solution to manage

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:36.446 A:middle
all of this complexity,

00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:38.536 A:middle
automatic signing.

00:03:40.096 --> 00:03:41.406 A:middle
When you enable automatically

00:03:41.406 --> 00:03:43.056 A:middle
managed signing, XCode will

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.066 A:middle
automatically create app IDs.

00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:46.356 A:middle
It will create certificates.

00:03:46.356 --> 00:03:47.636 A:middle
It will update provisioning

00:03:47.636 --> 00:03:48.416 A:middle
profiles.

00:03:48.636 --> 00:03:49.856 A:middle
It will update entitlements.

00:03:49.856 --> 00:03:51.316 A:middle
It will do all of that stuff you

00:03:51.316 --> 00:03:52.866 A:middle
don't want to deal with, so that

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:53.666 A:middle
you can get on with your

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:54.186 A:middle
development.

00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:57.156 A:middle
Enabling automatic signing is

00:03:57.156 --> 00:03:57.926 A:middle
really the way to go.

00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:01.226 A:middle
And I'm pleased to announce that

00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:04.056 A:middle
in XCode 9, all of this great

00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:06.156 A:middle
functionality is available in

00:04:06.186 --> 00:04:06.966 A:middle
XCode Server.

00:04:07.496 --> 00:04:10.446 A:middle
And we know that there are

00:04:10.446 --> 00:04:11.746 A:middle
certain situations in which

00:04:11.746 --> 00:04:12.676 A:middle
you'd like to directly

00:04:12.676 --> 00:04:13.766 A:middle
manipulate your signing

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:14.586 A:middle
configuration.

00:04:14.846 --> 00:04:17.026 A:middle
So, we also have manual signing

00:04:17.026 --> 00:04:18.556 A:middle
support in XCode Server.

00:04:20.756 --> 00:04:22.396 A:middle
So, for those of you who don't

00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:23.706 A:middle
know, I hope you know that XCode

00:04:23.706 --> 00:04:24.936 A:middle
Server is the continuous

00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:26.846 A:middle
integration service powered by

00:04:26.846 --> 00:04:27.246 A:middle
XCode.

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:30.496 A:middle
And now, it is built right into

00:04:30.496 --> 00:04:31.006 A:middle
XCode.

00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:32.126 A:middle
You no longer need to have

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:33.196 A:middle
Server app installed.

00:04:33.196 --> 00:04:34.596 A:middle
If you've used this before, this

00:04:34.596 --> 00:04:35.986 A:middle
is a huge convenience.

00:04:35.986 --> 00:04:37.426 A:middle
It has never been easier to get

00:04:37.456 --> 00:04:38.446 A:middle
going with continuous

00:04:38.446 --> 00:04:39.016 A:middle
integration.

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:43.326 A:middle
And XCode Server allows you to

00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:45.496 A:middle
very easily set up testing on

00:04:45.496 --> 00:04:49.306 A:middle
the Simulator and on the device.

00:04:49.306 --> 00:04:51.176 A:middle
Now, testing on the device

00:04:51.176 --> 00:04:52.296 A:middle
requires code signing.

00:04:53.636 --> 00:04:56.166 A:middle
So, I'd like to explain how code

00:04:56.166 --> 00:04:57.126 A:middle
signing fits into the greater

00:04:57.126 --> 00:04:58.286 A:middle
picture of XCode Server.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.516 A:middle
When you're working on your app

00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:05.326 A:middle
in XCode, you work on a project

00:05:05.646 --> 00:05:07.176 A:middle
and you upload updates to that

00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:08.986 A:middle
project to a remote repository.

00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:11.436 A:middle
You then, set up XCode Server

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:12.776 A:middle
with a bot to pull from that

00:05:12.776 --> 00:05:15.296 A:middle
repository, build your app, and

00:05:15.296 --> 00:05:16.756 A:middle
run tests on the device.

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:19.546 A:middle
And running on a device requires

00:05:19.546 --> 00:05:20.306 A:middle
a code signature.

00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:23.616 A:middle
And XCode composes that code

00:05:23.616 --> 00:05:24.986 A:middle
signature using those essential

00:05:24.986 --> 00:05:26.136 A:middle
ingredients, the provisioning

00:05:26.136 --> 00:05:27.616 A:middle
profile and a signing

00:05:27.616 --> 00:05:28.226 A:middle
certificate.

00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:29.606 A:middle
So, how are we going to get

00:05:29.606 --> 00:05:31.146 A:middle
those onto XCode Server?

00:05:32.506 --> 00:05:35.216 A:middle
Well, the good news is if you

00:05:35.216 --> 00:05:36.496 A:middle
have targets enabled with

00:05:36.496 --> 00:05:38.406 A:middle
automatic signing, this can just

00:05:38.406 --> 00:05:39.146 A:middle
happen for you.

00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:41.916 A:middle
XCode Server will automatically

00:05:42.036 --> 00:05:43.346 A:middle
create certificates, it will

00:05:43.346 --> 00:05:44.916 A:middle
update provisioning profiles, it

00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:46.216 A:middle
will register devices.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:47.936 A:middle
All so, that signing can be

00:05:47.936 --> 00:05:48.506 A:middle
performed.

00:05:48.506 --> 00:05:49.666 A:middle
This is really fantastic.

00:05:51.266 --> 00:05:53.026 A:middle
And if you have manual setup for

00:05:53.026 --> 00:05:53.776 A:middle
your targets.

00:05:54.856 --> 00:05:56.646 A:middle
XCode Server now has UI for you

00:05:56.646 --> 00:05:58.346 A:middle
to send any certificates from

00:05:58.346 --> 00:06:01.496 A:middle
your administrative Mac over to

00:06:01.596 --> 00:06:02.776 A:middle
the server that will be

00:06:02.776 --> 00:06:04.166 A:middle
performing integrations and code

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:04.546 A:middle
signing.

00:06:05.216 --> 00:06:08.186 A:middle
So, XCode Server now has support

00:06:08.616 --> 00:06:09.896 A:middle
for automatic and manual

00:06:09.896 --> 00:06:10.246 A:middle
signing.

00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:14.826 A:middle
Now, XCode Server is able to

00:06:14.826 --> 00:06:16.336 A:middle
make use of automatic signing,

00:06:16.336 --> 00:06:18.606 A:middle
because you join XCode Server to

00:06:18.606 --> 00:06:20.016 A:middle
your team as another member.

00:06:20.076 --> 00:06:21.496 A:middle
You do this during XCode Server

00:06:21.496 --> 00:06:23.386 A:middle
setup, if you're a team agent or

00:06:23.386 --> 00:06:23.746 A:middle
admin.

00:06:24.866 --> 00:06:27.036 A:middle
And XCode Server now supports

00:06:27.036 --> 00:06:29.126 A:middle
logins from Apple IDs with

00:06:29.126 --> 00:06:30.316 A:middle
two-factor authentication.

00:06:31.496 --> 00:06:33.676 A:middle
Now, all of this great signing

00:06:33.676 --> 00:06:35.056 A:middle
functionality is available to

00:06:35.056 --> 00:06:37.496 A:middle
XCode Server because XCode

00:06:37.496 --> 00:06:38.856 A:middle
Server, under the hood, calls

00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:40.196 A:middle
out to the command line tool,

00:06:40.626 --> 00:06:41.326 A:middle
XCode Build.

00:06:42.396 --> 00:06:44.976 A:middle
Which means that XCode Build now

00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:46.736 A:middle
offers command line support for

00:06:46.736 --> 00:06:48.046 A:middle
automatic signing repairs.

00:06:48.396 --> 00:06:49.206 A:middle
And this is huge.

00:06:50.416 --> 00:06:52.426 A:middle
Now, if you have a third-party

00:06:52.426 --> 00:06:53.956 A:middle
continuous integration service,

00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:54.866 A:middle
you should listen up.

00:06:54.936 --> 00:06:56.416 A:middle
Because what this means is that

00:06:57.206 --> 00:06:58.776 A:middle
XCode Build can now update

00:06:58.776 --> 00:07:00.286 A:middle
provisioning profiles, it can

00:07:00.616 --> 00:07:01.906 A:middle
download them, it can create

00:07:01.906 --> 00:07:02.546 A:middle
certificates.

00:07:02.546 --> 00:07:03.856 A:middle
All that magic that happens in

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:05.286 A:middle
the UI, can now happen on the

00:07:05.286 --> 00:07:05.906 A:middle
command line.

00:07:07.516 --> 00:07:12.886 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:07:13.386 --> 00:07:14.846 A:middle
And you enable this in XCode

00:07:14.846 --> 00:07:16.496 A:middle
Build by passing the flag

00:07:16.556 --> 00:07:18.126 A:middle
allowProvisioningUpdates.

00:07:19.316 --> 00:07:20.406 A:middle
And we've added some extra

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:21.076 A:middle
automation.

00:07:21.276 --> 00:07:22.546 A:middle
If you have a device connected

00:07:22.546 --> 00:07:24.606 A:middle
to your Mac, you can have it

00:07:24.606 --> 00:07:25.876 A:middle
automatically registered with

00:07:25.876 --> 00:07:27.386 A:middle
your team without interaction,

00:07:27.436 --> 00:07:28.716 A:middle
if you also pass the flag

00:07:28.946 --> 00:07:30.446 A:middle
allowProvisioningDevice

00:07:30.446 --> 00:07:31.056 A:middle
Registration.

00:07:32.116 --> 00:07:32.796 A:middle
So, very cool.

00:07:33.806 --> 00:07:36.596 A:middle
So, as I've said, setting up

00:07:36.646 --> 00:07:38.736 A:middle
XCode Server is super easy, now

00:07:38.736 --> 00:07:40.556 A:middle
that it's built right into XCode

00:07:40.556 --> 00:07:40.916 A:middle
9.

00:07:41.316 --> 00:07:42.826 A:middle
I'd like to show you how you set

00:07:42.826 --> 00:07:44.576 A:middle
up XCode Server, briefly, so

00:07:44.576 --> 00:07:46.026 A:middle
that I can show you how to set

00:07:46.026 --> 00:07:47.126 A:middle
up signing for that server.

00:07:48.386 --> 00:07:50.996 A:middle
So, the first step is opening up

00:07:51.076 --> 00:07:52.926 A:middle
the Preferences of XCode.

00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:54.176 A:middle
And all the way to the right, we

00:07:54.176 --> 00:07:55.896 A:middle
have a new tab, Server and Bots.

00:07:56.146 --> 00:07:57.426 A:middle
That's where you turn on XCode

00:07:57.426 --> 00:07:57.746 A:middle
Server.

00:07:58.636 --> 00:08:01.126 A:middle
The next step is opening up the

00:08:01.126 --> 00:08:04.056 A:middle
Accounts pane, where you can add

00:08:04.196 --> 00:08:05.136 A:middle
a client account.

00:08:05.496 --> 00:08:07.156 A:middle
That way you can view your

00:08:07.156 --> 00:08:07.916 A:middle
server working.

00:08:09.756 --> 00:08:11.186 A:middle
The next step is opening up your

00:08:11.186 --> 00:08:12.856 A:middle
project and using the Product

00:08:12.856 --> 00:08:14.186 A:middle
menu to create a Bot.

00:08:14.346 --> 00:08:16.456 A:middle
And then, in the Reports

00:08:16.456 --> 00:08:18.136 A:middle
navigator, you can view all the

00:08:18.136 --> 00:08:19.426 A:middle
integrations that your Bot have

00:08:19.426 --> 00:08:19.956 A:middle
been running.

00:08:20.516 --> 00:08:21.846 A:middle
You can see all the servers and

00:08:21.846 --> 00:08:22.246 A:middle
Bots.

00:08:22.526 --> 00:08:23.926 A:middle
And each integration, you can

00:08:23.926 --> 00:08:25.116 A:middle
see whether your project is

00:08:25.116 --> 00:08:27.936 A:middle
built, whether tests you have,

00:08:27.936 --> 00:08:29.356 A:middle
have run, whether they've

00:08:29.356 --> 00:08:30.326 A:middle
succeeded or failed.

00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:33.646 A:middle
That's what you can see, here.

00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:35.686 A:middle
And now, when you set up XCode

00:08:35.686 --> 00:08:37.386 A:middle
Server, there's a new tab, the

00:08:37.386 --> 00:08:38.316 A:middle
Signing tab.

00:08:38.316 --> 00:08:39.166 A:middle
This is what it looks like.

00:08:40.136 --> 00:08:42.226 A:middle
This gives a number of options

00:08:42.226 --> 00:08:43.546 A:middle
so that you can set up XCode

00:08:43.546 --> 00:08:45.466 A:middle
Server to be powered to use

00:08:45.516 --> 00:08:46.316 A:middle
automatic signing.

00:08:46.866 --> 00:08:48.636 A:middle
This first checkbox, Allow XCode

00:08:48.636 --> 00:08:50.106 A:middle
Server to manage my certificates

00:08:50.106 --> 00:08:51.646 A:middle
and profile, will give XCode

00:08:51.646 --> 00:08:52.966 A:middle
Server the power to use

00:08:53.006 --> 00:08:54.516 A:middle
automatic signing for any of

00:08:54.516 --> 00:08:55.566 A:middle
those targets in which it's

00:08:55.566 --> 00:08:55.936 A:middle
enabled.

00:08:56.806 --> 00:08:58.206 A:middle
And you authorize that, again,

00:08:58.206 --> 00:08:59.976 A:middle
by adding XCode Server to your

00:08:59.976 --> 00:09:00.376 A:middle
team.

00:09:00.376 --> 00:09:01.226 A:middle
And you do that, here.

00:09:01.786 --> 00:09:03.696 A:middle
And then, there is this other

00:09:03.696 --> 00:09:05.276 A:middle
checkbox, Automatically add

00:09:05.276 --> 00:09:06.786 A:middle
missing devices to my developer

00:09:06.786 --> 00:09:07.116 A:middle
team.

00:09:07.116 --> 00:09:08.586 A:middle
This will automatically register

00:09:08.586 --> 00:09:10.166 A:middle
any devices connected to your

00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:12.186 A:middle
Mac, without interaction.

00:09:12.336 --> 00:09:14.106 A:middle
And those two checkboxes in the

00:09:14.106 --> 00:09:16.206 A:middle
UI mirror those flags, allow

00:09:16.206 --> 00:09:17.596 A:middle
provisioning updates, and allow

00:09:17.636 --> 00:09:19.056 A:middle
provisioning device registration

00:09:19.056 --> 00:09:20.126 A:middle
for XCode Build.

00:09:21.046 --> 00:09:22.586 A:middle
So, I've said enough.

00:09:22.736 --> 00:09:23.626 A:middle
Why don't I actually show you

00:09:23.626 --> 00:09:23.976 A:middle
this working?

00:09:29.466 --> 00:09:33.866 A:middle
Okay. So, I have opened up XCode

00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:35.436 A:middle
to my project, ChocolateChip.

00:09:36.966 --> 00:09:38.876 A:middle
And I've already set up Server

00:09:39.476 --> 00:09:41.196 A:middle
with a Bot to perform

00:09:41.196 --> 00:09:43.116 A:middle
integrations on the Simulator.

00:09:43.776 --> 00:09:45.136 A:middle
So, I've just purchased this

00:09:45.136 --> 00:09:46.516 A:middle
shiny new device, and I'd like

00:09:46.516 --> 00:09:48.176 A:middle
to run tests on the device.

00:09:48.726 --> 00:09:50.396 A:middle
In order to do that, I need to

00:09:50.396 --> 00:09:52.166 A:middle
enable XCode Server to make use

00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:53.056 A:middle
of automatic signing.

00:09:53.806 --> 00:09:56.456 A:middle
So, first step is clicking on

00:09:56.456 --> 00:09:57.456 A:middle
the Reports navigator.

00:09:57.456 --> 00:09:58.826 A:middle
And you can see here, the server

00:09:58.826 --> 00:09:59.606 A:middle
that I've created.

00:09:59.606 --> 00:09:59.976 A:middle
The Bot.

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:01.796 A:middle
And the one integration that's

00:10:01.796 --> 00:10:02.126 A:middle
run.

00:10:02.976 --> 00:10:04.896 A:middle
And I'm going to Control Click

00:10:05.406 --> 00:10:06.866 A:middle
and bring up the Bot editor.

00:10:07.386 --> 00:10:09.016 A:middle
So, my first step will be

00:10:09.016 --> 00:10:10.376 A:middle
clicking on the Devices tab,

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:11.566 A:middle
where you can see that I've set

00:10:11.566 --> 00:10:14.316 A:middle
up XCode Server to run tests on

00:10:14.316 --> 00:10:15.846 A:middle
the iPhone SE Simulator.

00:10:16.086 --> 00:10:17.056 A:middle
I'm going to change that,

00:10:17.056 --> 00:10:18.716 A:middle
instead, to run on any device

00:10:18.716 --> 00:10:19.936 A:middle
that's connected to the Mac.

00:10:20.776 --> 00:10:23.366 A:middle
Next, in the Signing tab, you

00:10:23.366 --> 00:10:24.536 A:middle
can see what we've been talking

00:10:24.536 --> 00:10:24.826 A:middle
about.

00:10:25.546 --> 00:10:27.836 A:middle
I'm going to allow XCode Server

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:29.086 A:middle
to create certificates and

00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:29.886 A:middle
profiles.

00:10:30.226 --> 00:10:32.396 A:middle
I'm going to add XCode Server to

00:10:32.396 --> 00:10:33.266 A:middle
my team.

00:10:33.906 --> 00:10:35.516 A:middle
And I'm going to allow XCode

00:10:35.516 --> 00:10:36.996 A:middle
Server to automatically register

00:10:36.996 --> 00:10:38.316 A:middle
any device that's connected,

00:10:38.316 --> 00:10:39.106 A:middle
including this one.

00:10:40.426 --> 00:10:40.756 A:middle
All right.

00:10:40.756 --> 00:10:42.326 A:middle
So, we're all ready to get

00:10:42.326 --> 00:10:43.886 A:middle
started testing on the device.

00:10:43.996 --> 00:10:45.676 A:middle
I'm going to manually initiate

00:10:45.676 --> 00:10:46.416 A:middle
an integration.

00:10:47.326 --> 00:10:49.276 A:middle
So, what's happening, now, is

00:10:49.276 --> 00:10:52.026 A:middle
XCode Server is downloading the

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:53.536 A:middle
project from the repository.

00:10:53.596 --> 00:10:54.596 A:middle
It's building the app.

00:10:55.486 --> 00:10:57.086 A:middle
It's creating a certificate,

00:10:57.086 --> 00:10:59.176 A:middle
registering my device, adding

00:10:59.176 --> 00:11:00.456 A:middle
that device to the profile,

00:11:00.456 --> 00:11:01.576 A:middle
downloading the profile and

00:11:01.576 --> 00:11:02.176 A:middle
signing it.

00:11:03.066 --> 00:11:04.506 A:middle
All so that we can run tests on

00:11:04.506 --> 00:11:05.116 A:middle
the device.

00:11:05.736 --> 00:11:07.766 A:middle
And normally, I would say, don't

00:11:07.766 --> 00:11:08.866 A:middle
watch your Bot, it's not that

00:11:08.866 --> 00:11:09.486 A:middle
much fun.

00:11:09.546 --> 00:11:11.206 A:middle
You can let this automate itself

00:11:11.476 --> 00:11:12.296 A:middle
in another room.

00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:15.046 A:middle
But after a certain amount of

00:11:15.046 --> 00:11:16.446 A:middle
bake time, our cookies will be

00:11:16.446 --> 00:11:16.816 A:middle
done.

00:11:17.456 --> 00:11:21.156 A:middle
And there we go.

00:11:21.426 --> 00:11:23.236 A:middle
All two of my tests have passed.

00:11:23.566 --> 00:11:24.476 A:middle
I'm in very good shape.

00:11:30.536 --> 00:11:32.816 A:middle
So, you've just seen how you can

00:11:32.816 --> 00:11:35.266 A:middle
set up XCode Server to

00:11:35.266 --> 00:11:36.406 A:middle
automatically perform

00:11:36.406 --> 00:11:37.696 A:middle
development signing so that you

00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:42.036 A:middle
can run tests on the device.

00:11:42.196 --> 00:11:45.126 A:middle
Now, we really like automatic

00:11:45.126 --> 00:11:45.616 A:middle
signing.

00:11:45.616 --> 00:11:48.176 A:middle
We don't want you to be consumed

00:11:48.176 --> 00:11:49.396 A:middle
with managing all of these

00:11:49.396 --> 00:11:50.086 A:middle
assets.

00:11:50.086 --> 00:11:51.196 A:middle
We want to be coding.

00:11:51.196 --> 00:11:52.266 A:middle
We want you to be coding, as

00:11:52.266 --> 00:11:52.556 A:middle
well.

00:11:53.586 --> 00:11:54.816 A:middle
Setting automatic signing.

00:11:54.816 --> 00:11:55.436 A:middle
I do t it.

00:11:55.646 --> 00:11:56.846 A:middle
We suggest everyone do it.

00:11:58.086 --> 00:11:59.506 A:middle
However, we know that there are

00:11:59.506 --> 00:12:01.046 A:middle
certain situations in which you

00:12:01.046 --> 00:12:03.096 A:middle
may want to directly manipulate

00:12:03.096 --> 00:12:04.326 A:middle
your signing configuration.

00:12:04.596 --> 00:12:06.566 A:middle
And for that, we have manual

00:12:06.566 --> 00:12:06.946 A:middle
signing.

00:12:07.196 --> 00:12:08.676 A:middle
And now, we've improved it.

00:12:10.106 --> 00:12:12.746 A:middle
We've added some improvements to

00:12:12.746 --> 00:12:14.766 A:middle
the certificates sheet in the

00:12:14.766 --> 00:12:15.886 A:middle
Accounts Preferences.

00:12:16.586 --> 00:12:18.726 A:middle
Now, this sheet will tell you

00:12:18.866 --> 00:12:20.616 A:middle
what certificates you've created

00:12:21.406 --> 00:12:23.126 A:middle
on your Mac and other Macs that

00:12:23.126 --> 00:12:23.506 A:middle
you own.

00:12:24.036 --> 00:12:25.986 A:middle
That's the developer's

00:12:25.986 --> 00:12:26.876 A:middle
certificates, above.

00:12:27.086 --> 00:12:28.586 A:middle
And in the section below, you

00:12:28.586 --> 00:12:30.216 A:middle
can see all of the distribution

00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:31.666 A:middle
certificates that have been

00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:33.276 A:middle
created by anyone on your team.

00:12:33.896 --> 00:12:34.916 A:middle
Whether they're on your machine

00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:35.286 A:middle
or not.

00:12:35.686 --> 00:12:36.446 A:middle
And we've improved the

00:12:36.446 --> 00:12:37.326 A:middle
visibility, here.

00:12:37.326 --> 00:12:39.716 A:middle
Now, you can see when a

00:12:39.716 --> 00:12:41.146 A:middle
certificate is missing a private

00:12:41.176 --> 00:12:42.396 A:middle
key or it's been revoked.

00:12:42.676 --> 00:12:44.136 A:middle
And we even include the creator

00:12:44.136 --> 00:12:45.776 A:middle
of the certificate, and you can

00:12:45.776 --> 00:12:47.096 A:middle
email the creator of that

00:12:47.096 --> 00:12:48.126 A:middle
certificate, right from the

00:12:48.126 --> 00:12:49.736 A:middle
sheet and ask them to share it

00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:49.976 A:middle
with you.

00:12:50.516 --> 00:12:55.936 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:56.436 --> 00:12:57.706 A:middle
In the Project Editor when

00:12:57.706 --> 00:12:59.336 A:middle
you're using manual, you select

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:00.596 A:middle
a profile, yourself.

00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:02.556 A:middle
And we've added a new menu item,

00:13:02.626 --> 00:13:03.746 A:middle
Download Profile.

00:13:03.746 --> 00:13:04.766 A:middle
It'll bring up a sheet that

00:13:04.766 --> 00:13:05.466 A:middle
looks like this.

00:13:06.026 --> 00:13:07.316 A:middle
And you can see, on the left, a

00:13:07.366 --> 00:13:09.736 A:middle
list of eligible profiles from

00:13:09.736 --> 00:13:11.286 A:middle
profiles that I've created on

00:13:11.286 --> 00:13:11.776 A:middle
the portal.

00:13:12.296 --> 00:13:13.826 A:middle
And these are profiles that are

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:15.096 A:middle
eligible for my target.

00:13:15.716 --> 00:13:16.866 A:middle
When I've selected one, you can

00:13:16.866 --> 00:13:18.776 A:middle
see a detailed view of that

00:13:18.776 --> 00:13:20.546 A:middle
profile and see how it compares

00:13:20.546 --> 00:13:21.266 A:middle
with your target.

00:13:22.006 --> 00:13:23.516 A:middle
Whether the capabilities match.

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:25.206 A:middle
Even if the device is connected,

00:13:25.206 --> 00:13:26.396 A:middle
you can see if that device is in

00:13:26.396 --> 00:13:27.056 A:middle
the profile.

00:13:27.356 --> 00:13:28.746 A:middle
This is a major improvement for

00:13:28.816 --> 00:13:30.796 A:middle
finding the right profile before

00:13:30.796 --> 00:13:31.976 A:middle
you select it and try to sign

00:13:31.976 --> 00:13:32.216 A:middle
with it.

00:13:32.726 --> 00:13:34.566 A:middle
And if you have a profile

00:13:34.566 --> 00:13:37.216 A:middle
selected, already, but it's not

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:38.186 A:middle
installed locally on your

00:13:38.186 --> 00:13:39.886 A:middle
machine, XCode will offer to

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:41.576 A:middle
download that profile for you.

00:13:42.316 --> 00:13:43.596 A:middle
Which, we know it will work.

00:13:44.126 --> 00:13:45.196 A:middle
Now, we know that you're still

00:13:45.196 --> 00:13:45.686 A:middle
in manual.

00:13:45.686 --> 00:13:46.836 A:middle
We're not interested in touching

00:13:46.836 --> 00:13:47.876 A:middle
your project state or your

00:13:47.876 --> 00:13:48.406 A:middle
portal state.

00:13:48.406 --> 00:13:49.446 A:middle
We're very clear about this

00:13:49.446 --> 00:13:49.996 A:middle
distinction.

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.346 A:middle
This is really just a

00:13:51.346 --> 00:13:51.936 A:middle
convenience.

00:13:52.676 --> 00:13:55.676 A:middle
And of course, in XCode Server,

00:13:55.676 --> 00:13:57.096 A:middle
we also have manual support.

00:13:58.046 --> 00:13:59.356 A:middle
Under the Signing tab you'll see

00:13:59.356 --> 00:14:00.706 A:middle
tab that's like this, the

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:02.276 A:middle
Certificates and Profiles tab,

00:14:02.276 --> 00:14:03.496 A:middle
where you can see a list of the

00:14:03.496 --> 00:14:05.586 A:middle
certificates and profiles

00:14:05.586 --> 00:14:07.566 A:middle
installed on your local machine.

00:14:07.766 --> 00:14:09.096 A:middle
That you can send over to your

00:14:09.096 --> 00:14:10.366 A:middle
server to perform manual

00:14:10.366 --> 00:14:10.726 A:middle
signing.

00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:14.526 A:middle
So, when you are using manual

00:14:14.526 --> 00:14:16.036 A:middle
signing, we recommend using the

00:14:16.036 --> 00:14:18.156 A:middle
General tab to make any changes

00:14:18.156 --> 00:14:19.196 A:middle
to your signing setup.

00:14:20.006 --> 00:14:23.116 A:middle
However, if you have automation

00:14:23.266 --> 00:14:25.656 A:middle
or you just don't want to use

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:28.616 A:middle
the UI, we have build settings

00:14:28.696 --> 00:14:29.906 A:middle
for extra flexibility.

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:31.966 A:middle
In XCode 8, we introduced

00:14:32.326 --> 00:14:34.136 A:middle
Development Team, that's to set

00:14:34.136 --> 00:14:35.126 A:middle
the team identifier.

00:14:36.446 --> 00:14:38.336 A:middle
Provisioning Profile Specifier,

00:14:38.676 --> 00:14:41.396 A:middle
to set the profile by name, and

00:14:41.396 --> 00:14:43.996 A:middle
Code Sign Identity, to set the

00:14:43.996 --> 00:14:44.606 A:middle
certificate.

00:14:46.056 --> 00:14:47.716 A:middle
And in XCode 9, we're

00:14:47.716 --> 00:14:49.986 A:middle
introducing a new build setting,

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:51.986 A:middle
Code Sign Style.

00:14:53.126 --> 00:14:55.096 A:middle
You can use Code Sign Style to

00:14:55.096 --> 00:14:58.016 A:middle
set the style to automatic or

00:14:58.016 --> 00:15:00.416 A:middle
manual at the target or build

00:15:00.416 --> 00:15:01.476 A:middle
configuration level.

00:15:02.756 --> 00:15:03.976 A:middle
We think that this is exciting,

00:15:03.976 --> 00:15:05.916 A:middle
but it's for advanced use cases.

00:15:05.976 --> 00:15:07.846 A:middle
For most cases, you should be

00:15:07.846 --> 00:15:09.616 A:middle
able to set your entire target,

00:15:09.616 --> 00:15:11.166 A:middle
keep it set, to automatic.

00:15:13.036 --> 00:15:15.246 A:middle
Well, you've seen just about all

00:15:15.246 --> 00:15:16.236 A:middle
there is for development

00:15:16.236 --> 00:15:16.666 A:middle
signing.

00:15:17.296 --> 00:15:18.266 A:middle
We've made a lot of great

00:15:18.266 --> 00:15:19.956 A:middle
improvements to distribution and

00:15:19.956 --> 00:15:20.976 A:middle
distribution signing.

00:15:21.536 --> 00:15:22.876 A:middle
For more on that, please give a

00:15:22.876 --> 00:15:24.906 A:middle
warm welcome to my friend Itai

00:15:25.496 --> 00:15:25.976 A:middle
Rom.

00:15:26.516 --> 00:15:33.406 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:33.906 --> 00:15:34.626 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Chris.

00:15:34.876 --> 00:15:35.856 A:middle
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:15:36.706 --> 00:15:37.886 A:middle
So, Chris just showed you all

00:15:37.886 --> 00:15:39.446 A:middle
the improvements we've made when

00:15:39.446 --> 00:15:40.566 A:middle
you're development signing your

00:15:40.566 --> 00:15:40.786 A:middle
app.

00:15:41.216 --> 00:15:42.516 A:middle
I'd like to change gears a bit,

00:15:42.516 --> 00:15:44.386 A:middle
and talk about distribution.

00:15:45.306 --> 00:15:46.576 A:middle
Now, when you're ready to share

00:15:46.576 --> 00:15:48.036 A:middle
your app with others, the first

00:15:48.036 --> 00:15:49.466 A:middle
thing you need to do is build an

00:15:49.466 --> 00:15:49.996 A:middle
archive.

00:15:51.336 --> 00:15:53.136 A:middle
An archive is a special release

00:15:53.186 --> 00:15:54.306 A:middle
build of your application.

00:15:54.716 --> 00:15:56.096 A:middle
And we recommend development

00:15:56.096 --> 00:15:56.596 A:middle
signing it.

00:15:56.896 --> 00:15:58.076 A:middle
In fact, that's the default

00:15:58.076 --> 00:15:58.466 A:middle
setting.

00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:00.286 A:middle
Now, the reason that we

00:16:00.286 --> 00:16:01.856 A:middle
recommend that is so that any

00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:03.446 A:middle
developer on your team can

00:16:03.446 --> 00:16:04.666 A:middle
easily build an archive and

00:16:04.666 --> 00:16:05.416 A:middle
share it with other.

00:16:05.766 --> 00:16:07.196 A:middle
Without needing access to any

00:16:07.196 --> 00:16:08.866 A:middle
special distribution signing

00:16:08.866 --> 00:16:09.526 A:middle
certificates.

00:16:10.496 --> 00:16:13.116 A:middle
The archive contains both the

00:16:13.116 --> 00:16:14.666 A:middle
machine code and bitcode of your

00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:16.116 A:middle
app, as well as your debugging

00:16:16.116 --> 00:16:18.186 A:middle
symbols, all bundled up

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:18.616 A:middle
together.

00:16:18.706 --> 00:16:19.996 A:middle
And once you've built one of

00:16:19.996 --> 00:16:21.866 A:middle
these you can use XCode's

00:16:21.866 --> 00:16:23.606 A:middle
Organizer window to generate an

00:16:23.696 --> 00:16:25.136 A:middle
IPA and upload it to the App

00:16:25.136 --> 00:16:25.456 A:middle
Store.

00:16:26.846 --> 00:16:28.736 A:middle
When you generate that IPA,

00:16:28.736 --> 00:16:30.296 A:middle
XCode will distribution sign

00:16:30.296 --> 00:16:32.236 A:middle
your app according to App Store

00:16:32.236 --> 00:16:32.896 A:middle
requirements.

00:16:33.236 --> 00:16:34.866 A:middle
So, this is the other part of

00:16:34.866 --> 00:16:35.866 A:middle
why you can development sign

00:16:35.866 --> 00:16:36.466 A:middle
your archives.

00:16:36.556 --> 00:16:37.986 A:middle
Because XCode will resign your

00:16:37.986 --> 00:16:39.566 A:middle
app when you distribute it.

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:41.856 A:middle
In fact, you can distribute your

00:16:41.856 --> 00:16:43.226 A:middle
archive in a variety of ways.

00:16:43.896 --> 00:16:45.816 A:middle
You can ad hoc distribution sign

00:16:45.816 --> 00:16:47.516 A:middle
it if you want to share the app

00:16:47.516 --> 00:16:48.826 A:middle
with other people on your team

00:16:48.826 --> 00:16:50.056 A:middle
or your QA engineers.

00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:51.476 A:middle
Or if you're a member of the

00:16:51.476 --> 00:16:52.996 A:middle
Enterprise Developer program,

00:16:53.386 --> 00:16:55.456 A:middle
you can enterprise sign it and

00:16:55.456 --> 00:16:56.526 A:middle
share the app with other

00:16:56.526 --> 00:16:57.506 A:middle
employees in your company.

00:16:58.126 --> 00:17:00.346 A:middle
Now, in addition to the

00:17:00.346 --> 00:17:01.906 A:middle
distribution method there are a

00:17:01.906 --> 00:17:03.106 A:middle
lot of other choices you need to

00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:04.166 A:middle
make when you distribute your

00:17:04.166 --> 00:17:04.306 A:middle
app.

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:06.296 A:middle
You need to choose how you want

00:17:06.296 --> 00:17:07.676 A:middle
to sign it, which profiles to

00:17:07.676 --> 00:17:08.776 A:middle
use, which entitlements it

00:17:08.776 --> 00:17:09.076 A:middle
needs.

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:11.486 A:middle
If you're using bitcode app

00:17:11.486 --> 00:17:13.626 A:middle
thinning or on-demand resources,

00:17:13.916 --> 00:17:15.066 A:middle
then you also need to decide how

00:17:15.066 --> 00:17:15.926 A:middle
you want to handle those

00:17:15.926 --> 00:17:16.396 A:middle
features.

00:17:16.636 --> 00:17:17.576 A:middle
And if you're uploading to the

00:17:17.576 --> 00:17:18.686 A:middle
App Store, then you need to

00:17:18.686 --> 00:17:19.596 A:middle
decide whether you want to

00:17:19.596 --> 00:17:20.626 A:middle
include symbols or not.

00:17:21.816 --> 00:17:23.286 A:middle
So, this can get quite complex.

00:17:24.596 --> 00:17:25.916 A:middle
I'm pleased to announce that in

00:17:25.916 --> 00:17:27.206 A:middle
XCode 9 we've made some major

00:17:27.206 --> 00:17:28.586 A:middle
improvements to the distribution

00:17:28.586 --> 00:17:30.156 A:middle
workflow that'll make is easier

00:17:30.156 --> 00:17:31.426 A:middle
than ever before to share your

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:32.276 A:middle
apps with others.

00:17:32.906 --> 00:17:34.416 A:middle
While also giving you more power

00:17:34.416 --> 00:17:35.856 A:middle
and control over the process.

00:17:36.516 --> 00:17:37.946 A:middle
Now, the first thing we've added

00:17:38.226 --> 00:17:39.396 A:middle
is automatic signing.

00:17:39.986 --> 00:17:42.896 A:middle
This works just like during

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:43.446 A:middle
development.

00:17:43.446 --> 00:17:44.986 A:middle
So, XCode will take care of all

00:17:44.986 --> 00:17:46.486 A:middle
the distribution signing details

00:17:46.486 --> 00:17:47.006 A:middle
for you.

00:17:47.486 --> 00:17:48.496 A:middle
And you can focus on other

00:17:48.496 --> 00:17:49.016 A:middle
tasks.

00:17:49.586 --> 00:17:51.046 A:middle
In addition to automatic

00:17:51.046 --> 00:17:53.026 A:middle
signing, for those of you who

00:17:53.026 --> 00:17:54.476 A:middle
want full control we've added

00:17:54.526 --> 00:17:55.696 A:middle
manual signing to the

00:17:55.696 --> 00:17:56.706 A:middle
distribution workflow.

00:17:57.506 --> 00:17:59.066 A:middle
So, now you can create your own

00:17:59.066 --> 00:18:00.456 A:middle
distribution profiles and tell

00:18:00.456 --> 00:18:01.586 A:middle
XCode which ones to use.

00:18:01.946 --> 00:18:03.336 A:middle
But XCode will never create or

00:18:03.336 --> 00:18:05.086 A:middle
modify any of those profiles.

00:18:06.456 --> 00:18:09.426 A:middle
In addition to automatic and

00:18:09.426 --> 00:18:10.666 A:middle
manual signing, we've made a lot

00:18:10.666 --> 00:18:11.616 A:middle
of other improvements.

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:12.836 A:middle
We've streamlined the

00:18:12.836 --> 00:18:13.846 A:middle
distribution workflow.

00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:16.086 A:middle
So, for example, XCode won't ask

00:18:16.086 --> 00:18:17.106 A:middle
you which development team you

00:18:17.106 --> 00:18:17.956 A:middle
want to use, anymore.

00:18:18.346 --> 00:18:19.216 A:middle
Because it already knows the

00:18:19.216 --> 00:18:19.606 A:middle
answer.

00:18:21.316 --> 00:18:21.506 A:middle
Yeah.

00:18:22.516 --> 00:18:25.776 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:26.276 --> 00:18:27.126 A:middle
We've also improved the

00:18:27.126 --> 00:18:28.606 A:middle
visibility of errors.

00:18:28.886 --> 00:18:30.376 A:middle
So, now it's easier to tell what

00:18:30.376 --> 00:18:31.546 A:middle
went wrong when you run into a

00:18:31.546 --> 00:18:32.796 A:middle
problem, and what you need to do

00:18:32.796 --> 00:18:34.126 A:middle
to resolve it.

00:18:35.396 --> 00:18:36.486 A:middle
We've enhanced export

00:18:36.486 --> 00:18:37.176 A:middle
functionality.

00:18:37.536 --> 00:18:39.726 A:middle
So, now in XCode 9, once you've

00:18:39.726 --> 00:18:41.246 A:middle
uploaded your app to the App

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:43.056 A:middle
Store, you can save a copy of

00:18:43.056 --> 00:18:44.236 A:middle
your IPA in case you need to

00:18:44.236 --> 00:18:45.546 A:middle
refer back to it, later on.

00:18:46.686 --> 00:18:48.796 A:middle
And finally, we've enhanced the

00:18:48.796 --> 00:18:50.066 A:middle
command line support in XCode

00:18:50.066 --> 00:18:51.276 A:middle
Build, so that you can take

00:18:51.276 --> 00:18:52.416 A:middle
advantage of all of these new

00:18:52.466 --> 00:18:54.136 A:middle
features in your automation.

00:18:54.746 --> 00:18:57.136 A:middle
Let's dive into automatic

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:58.036 A:middle
signing, a little bit more.

00:18:58.776 --> 00:19:00.536 A:middle
This works just like development

00:19:00.536 --> 00:19:00.946 A:middle
signing.

00:19:01.186 --> 00:19:03.446 A:middle
XCode will create XCode managed

00:19:03.656 --> 00:19:04.816 A:middle
distribution profiles.

00:19:05.126 --> 00:19:06.086 A:middle
These are profiles that are

00:19:06.086 --> 00:19:07.456 A:middle
completely under XCode's

00:19:07.456 --> 00:19:07.916 A:middle
control.

00:19:07.956 --> 00:19:10.436 A:middle
And they're the only profiles

00:19:10.436 --> 00:19:11.506 A:middle
that XCode will use for

00:19:11.506 --> 00:19:12.896 A:middle
automatic distribution signing.

00:19:12.976 --> 00:19:14.746 A:middle
It will never touch or use any

00:19:14.746 --> 00:19:16.346 A:middle
of your manually made profiles.

00:19:17.676 --> 00:19:18.926 A:middle
In addition, XCode will make it

00:19:18.926 --> 00:19:20.066 A:middle
easy to create and share your

00:19:20.066 --> 00:19:21.126 A:middle
distribution certificates.

00:19:21.576 --> 00:19:22.456 A:middle
These are different from

00:19:22.456 --> 00:19:23.516 A:middle
development certificates,

00:19:23.516 --> 00:19:24.756 A:middle
because they're team owned

00:19:24.756 --> 00:19:25.606 A:middle
signing assets.

00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:26.986 A:middle
So, it's really important that

00:19:26.986 --> 00:19:28.236 A:middle
you know when you've created one

00:19:28.506 --> 00:19:30.206 A:middle
and you save it, so that you can

00:19:30.206 --> 00:19:31.486 A:middle
reinstall it later or share it

00:19:31.486 --> 00:19:32.066 A:middle
with others.

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:34.576 A:middle
And finally, last but not least,

00:19:35.076 --> 00:19:36.446 A:middle
for those of you with carefully

00:19:36.446 --> 00:19:38.626 A:middle
crafted signing setups, in XCode

00:19:38.626 --> 00:19:40.236 A:middle
9, XCode will never offer to

00:19:40.236 --> 00:19:41.186 A:middle
revoke a distribution

00:19:41.186 --> 00:19:41.736 A:middle
certificate.

00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:45.116 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:19:45.616 --> 00:19:46.726 A:middle
Yeah. So, we're all very happy

00:19:46.726 --> 00:19:47.286 A:middle
about that one.

00:19:47.696 --> 00:19:48.486 A:middle
So, you don't have to worry

00:19:48.486 --> 00:19:49.966 A:middle
about any enterprising member of

00:19:49.966 --> 00:19:51.656 A:middle
your team ruining your carefully

00:19:51.656 --> 00:19:53.006 A:middle
crafted setup through XCode,

00:19:53.006 --> 00:19:53.346 A:middle
anymore.

00:19:55.296 --> 00:19:56.676 A:middle
So, here's an example of the

00:19:56.676 --> 00:19:57.916 A:middle
improved Air presentation.

00:19:57.916 --> 00:19:59.356 A:middle
This is a common and potentially

00:19:59.356 --> 00:19:59.976 A:middle
confusing situation.

00:20:00.236 --> 00:20:02.556 A:middle
Someone on your team has already

00:20:02.556 --> 00:20:03.656 A:middle
created a distribution

00:20:03.656 --> 00:20:05.226 A:middle
certificate, but you don't have

00:20:05.226 --> 00:20:05.926 A:middle
that certificate.

00:20:06.356 --> 00:20:08.056 A:middle
Or, more likely, you don't have

00:20:08.056 --> 00:20:08.806 A:middle
its private key.

00:20:09.506 --> 00:20:10.956 A:middle
Well, now XCode 9 tells you

00:20:10.956 --> 00:20:12.096 A:middle
exactly who created those

00:20:12.096 --> 00:20:13.696 A:middle
certificates, makes it really

00:20:13.696 --> 00:20:14.716 A:middle
easy to contact them.

00:20:15.096 --> 00:20:16.266 A:middle
So, you can get the information

00:20:16.266 --> 00:20:17.556 A:middle
you need to finish the workflow.

00:20:18.626 --> 00:20:19.736 A:middle
Now, that's just one example.

00:20:19.736 --> 00:20:20.846 A:middle
There are many others throughout

00:20:20.846 --> 00:20:22.226 A:middle
the distribution workflow of

00:20:22.226 --> 00:20:23.196 A:middle
improved errors.

00:20:25.196 --> 00:20:26.276 A:middle
The enhanced export

00:20:26.276 --> 00:20:26.906 A:middle
functionality.

00:20:27.646 --> 00:20:29.526 A:middle
So, as I mentioned earlier, now

00:20:29.526 --> 00:20:31.056 A:middle
it's easy to save aside a copy

00:20:31.056 --> 00:20:32.116 A:middle
of your IPA after you've

00:20:32.116 --> 00:20:33.716 A:middle
uploaded it to the App Store.

00:20:34.006 --> 00:20:34.936 A:middle
But you get more than that.

00:20:35.566 --> 00:20:36.846 A:middle
We also give you a distribution

00:20:36.846 --> 00:20:37.546 A:middle
summary PLIST.

00:20:37.546 --> 00:20:39.276 A:middle
So, just like a receipt it shows

00:20:39.276 --> 00:20:40.926 A:middle
you all the content in your IPA,

00:20:41.106 --> 00:20:42.636 A:middle
how XCode resigned it, which

00:20:42.636 --> 00:20:44.666 A:middle
entitlements it has, and so on.

00:20:45.546 --> 00:20:46.816 A:middle
You also get a packaging log,

00:20:46.816 --> 00:20:47.906 A:middle
which is like a build log.

00:20:48.296 --> 00:20:50.176 A:middle
It shows you, step by step, all

00:20:50.176 --> 00:20:51.316 A:middle
of the commands that XCode

00:20:51.316 --> 00:20:52.926 A:middle
issued when it transformed your

00:20:52.926 --> 00:20:54.786 A:middle
archive into an IPA.

00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:58.386 A:middle
And you get an export options

00:20:58.386 --> 00:20:58.996 A:middle
PLIST.

00:20:59.796 --> 00:21:01.946 A:middle
So, this last one is kind of

00:21:01.946 --> 00:21:02.446 A:middle
interesting.

00:21:03.026 --> 00:21:04.716 A:middle
An export options PLIST is like

00:21:04.716 --> 00:21:05.306 A:middle
a recipe.

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:06.806 A:middle
It describes how you want to

00:21:06.806 --> 00:21:08.946 A:middle
transform your archive into an

00:21:09.026 --> 00:21:09.626 A:middle
IPA.

00:21:10.016 --> 00:21:12.016 A:middle
And when you want to automate

00:21:12.016 --> 00:21:13.566 A:middle
the process of generating IPAs,

00:21:13.566 --> 00:21:14.976 A:middle
which you do, is you invoke

00:21:14.976 --> 00:21:16.326 A:middle
XCode Build and give it one of

00:21:16.326 --> 00:21:17.826 A:middle
these export options PLISTs.

00:21:18.346 --> 00:21:19.736 A:middle
Now, in XCode 9, it's really

00:21:19.736 --> 00:21:21.166 A:middle
easy to create these, because

00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:22.606 A:middle
the distribution workflow will

00:21:22.606 --> 00:21:23.576 A:middle
generate one for you.

00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:24.976 A:middle
So, you don't need to manually

00:21:24.976 --> 00:21:26.266 A:middle
edit these PLISTs, anymore.

00:21:27.546 --> 00:21:28.526 A:middle
Here's an example of what one

00:21:28.526 --> 00:21:28.976 A:middle
looks like.

00:21:29.696 --> 00:21:31.086 A:middle
This is a really simple export

00:21:31.086 --> 00:21:31.796 A:middle
options PLIST.

00:21:31.796 --> 00:21:33.566 A:middle
As you can see, I've set up

00:21:33.676 --> 00:21:35.356 A:middle
automatic signing and I'm

00:21:35.356 --> 00:21:36.576 A:middle
exporting for the App Store.

00:21:37.526 --> 00:21:38.746 A:middle
And this last key in their

00:21:38.746 --> 00:21:39.926 A:middle
upload symbols, I actually don't

00:21:39.926 --> 00:21:40.846 A:middle
even need to include that.

00:21:40.846 --> 00:21:42.136 A:middle
Because it defaults to Yes.

00:21:42.656 --> 00:21:44.036 A:middle
Now, there are a lot of options

00:21:44.126 --> 00:21:45.386 A:middle
that you can specify in these

00:21:45.386 --> 00:21:45.806 A:middle
files.

00:21:46.206 --> 00:21:47.876 A:middle
You can invoke XCode Build dash

00:21:47.876 --> 00:21:49.636 A:middle
Help in terminal, to see

00:21:49.636 --> 00:21:50.786 A:middle
everything that you can include

00:21:50.786 --> 00:21:52.006 A:middle
in an export options PLIST.

00:21:52.326 --> 00:21:53.356 A:middle
But most of the options have

00:21:53.356 --> 00:21:54.336 A:middle
sensible defaults.

00:21:55.916 --> 00:21:56.896 A:middle
When you're ready to use this,

00:21:56.896 --> 00:21:58.486 A:middle
all you do is invoke XCode Build

00:21:58.566 --> 00:22:00.476 A:middle
dash export archive, pass the

00:22:00.476 --> 00:22:01.486 A:middle
path of your archive and the

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:02.736 A:middle
path to your export options

00:22:02.776 --> 00:22:03.226 A:middle
PLIST.

00:22:03.796 --> 00:22:05.266 A:middle
And XCode Build will generate an

00:22:05.426 --> 00:22:06.076 A:middle
IPA for you.

00:22:06.726 --> 00:22:08.676 A:middle
Now, there's one other thing.

00:22:08.766 --> 00:22:09.966 A:middle
As you'll recall from Chris's

00:22:09.966 --> 00:22:11.936 A:middle
section, we've added a new flag

00:22:11.976 --> 00:22:12.986 A:middle
to XCode Build called

00:22:12.986 --> 00:22:14.346 A:middle
allowProvisioningUpdates.

00:22:14.616 --> 00:22:15.616 A:middle
And you can use that here, as

00:22:15.616 --> 00:22:15.996 A:middle
well.

00:22:16.266 --> 00:22:17.406 A:middle
So, that XCode Build will

00:22:17.406 --> 00:22:18.606 A:middle
automatically generate

00:22:18.876 --> 00:22:19.966 A:middle
distribution provisioning

00:22:19.966 --> 00:22:20.826 A:middle
profiles for you.

00:22:21.206 --> 00:22:22.426 A:middle
Anything that's necessary in

00:22:22.426 --> 00:22:24.476 A:middle
order to generate your IPA.

00:22:25.116 --> 00:22:26.626 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the new

00:22:26.626 --> 00:22:27.956 A:middle
distribution workflow in action.

00:22:35.456 --> 00:22:36.716 A:middle
Okay. So, here's our

00:22:36.716 --> 00:22:37.716 A:middle
ChocolateChip app, which we've

00:22:37.716 --> 00:22:38.886 A:middle
been working on for a while.

00:22:39.666 --> 00:22:40.586 A:middle
And as you can see, our

00:22:40.586 --> 00:22:41.926 A:middle
extensive two test suite is

00:22:41.926 --> 00:22:42.476 A:middle
passing.

00:22:42.476 --> 00:22:43.686 A:middle
So, now we're ready to upload it

00:22:43.686 --> 00:22:44.346 A:middle
to the App Store.

00:22:45.126 --> 00:22:46.416 A:middle
I'm going to start that off by

00:22:46.416 --> 00:22:48.726 A:middle
clicking product and creating an

00:22:48.726 --> 00:22:49.236 A:middle
archive.

00:22:49.916 --> 00:22:51.606 A:middle
And XCode's going to do that

00:22:51.606 --> 00:22:53.396 A:middle
release build of my app, bundle

00:22:53.396 --> 00:22:55.226 A:middle
it all up, and then show me the

00:22:55.226 --> 00:22:56.886 A:middle
archive once it's completed, in

00:22:56.886 --> 00:22:57.776 A:middle
the Organizer window.

00:22:58.866 --> 00:23:00.856 A:middle
From here, I can easily upload

00:23:00.856 --> 00:23:02.116 A:middle
it to the App Store by clicking

00:23:02.116 --> 00:23:04.886 A:middle
this very shiny enticing blue

00:23:04.886 --> 00:23:05.236 A:middle
button.

00:23:06.256 --> 00:23:07.286 A:middle
And when I click that, the

00:23:07.286 --> 00:23:08.546 A:middle
distribution workflow will drop

00:23:08.546 --> 00:23:08.876 A:middle
down.

00:23:09.796 --> 00:23:11.526 A:middle
Now, XCode's going to start by

00:23:11.526 --> 00:23:12.886 A:middle
analyzing some of the content in

00:23:12.886 --> 00:23:13.436 A:middle
my archive.

00:23:13.846 --> 00:23:15.216 A:middle
And that includes how my app was

00:23:15.266 --> 00:23:15.676 A:middle
signed.

00:23:15.786 --> 00:23:17.286 A:middle
So, that's how XCode knows which

00:23:17.286 --> 00:23:18.346 A:middle
development team I'm using.

00:23:18.696 --> 00:23:20.306 A:middle
It just reads the signature of

00:23:20.306 --> 00:23:21.086 A:middle
my archived app.

00:23:22.186 --> 00:23:23.706 A:middle
It also determines which options

00:23:23.746 --> 00:23:25.176 A:middle
to show me on the next screen.

00:23:25.906 --> 00:23:27.256 A:middle
This content is going to vary,

00:23:27.256 --> 00:23:28.746 A:middle
depending on what's in your

00:23:28.746 --> 00:23:30.096 A:middle
archive, as well as the

00:23:30.096 --> 00:23:31.496 A:middle
distribution method you choose.

00:23:31.896 --> 00:23:33.196 A:middle
So, if I had chosen ad hoc

00:23:33.236 --> 00:23:35.306 A:middle
distribution, then I'd see some

00:23:35.306 --> 00:23:36.196 A:middle
different options in here.

00:23:37.306 --> 00:23:38.346 A:middle
so, in this case, I have a

00:23:38.346 --> 00:23:39.946 A:middle
bitcode option, because my app

00:23:39.946 --> 00:23:40.766 A:middle
contains bitcode.

00:23:41.546 --> 00:23:44.876 A:middle
I also have a new Scrip Swift

00:23:44.876 --> 00:23:45.616 A:middle
symbols option.

00:23:46.716 --> 00:23:48.286 A:middle
What this is going to do, is it

00:23:48.286 --> 00:23:50.156 A:middle
allows the App Store to scrip

00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:51.956 A:middle
Swift symbols from the Swift

00:23:51.956 --> 00:23:53.206 A:middle
standard libraries in my app.

00:23:54.006 --> 00:23:54.916 A:middle
And that's going to greatly

00:23:54.916 --> 00:23:56.306 A:middle
reduce the download size of my

00:23:56.306 --> 00:23:57.426 A:middle
app for my customers.

00:23:57.426 --> 00:23:58.726 A:middle
So, I'm going to leave that on.

00:23:58.726 --> 00:24:01.216 A:middle
I also have the option to upload

00:24:01.216 --> 00:24:03.106 A:middle
symbols, which will allow me to

00:24:03.106 --> 00:24:04.396 A:middle
receive symbolicated crash

00:24:04.396 --> 00:24:05.296 A:middle
reports from Apple.

00:24:05.296 --> 00:24:06.536 A:middle
So, I'll leave that on, as well.

00:24:06.816 --> 00:24:07.396 A:middle
And click Next.

00:24:08.616 --> 00:24:09.836 A:middle
The next step is where I can

00:24:09.836 --> 00:24:11.106 A:middle
choose how I want to resign my

00:24:11.106 --> 00:24:11.346 A:middle
app.

00:24:11.796 --> 00:24:12.876 A:middle
I'll talk a little bit more

00:24:12.876 --> 00:24:14.596 A:middle
about manual signing, later.

00:24:14.896 --> 00:24:15.656 A:middle
For now, we'll stick to

00:24:15.656 --> 00:24:16.196 A:middle
automatic.

00:24:17.306 --> 00:24:18.486 A:middle
And XCode's going to start

00:24:18.486 --> 00:24:19.886 A:middle
talking to the developer website

00:24:20.146 --> 00:24:22.556 A:middle
and figure out how to resign my

00:24:22.556 --> 00:24:22.796 A:middle
app.

00:24:23.386 --> 00:24:24.756 A:middle
The first thing it looks for is

00:24:24.756 --> 00:24:25.726 A:middle
a distribution signing

00:24:25.726 --> 00:24:26.306 A:middle
certificate.

00:24:26.926 --> 00:24:27.946 A:middle
Now, in this case, my team

00:24:27.946 --> 00:24:29.226 A:middle
hasn't actually created one,

00:24:29.226 --> 00:24:29.426 A:middle
yet.

00:24:30.056 --> 00:24:31.376 A:middle
So, XCode tells me about that

00:24:31.986 --> 00:24:33.296 A:middle
and asks me if I want to create

00:24:33.296 --> 00:24:33.566 A:middle
one.

00:24:34.296 --> 00:24:35.656 A:middle
So, now XCode won't just create

00:24:35.656 --> 00:24:36.446 A:middle
one behind my back.

00:24:36.446 --> 00:24:38.066 A:middle
I'm fully aware that I'll have a

00:24:38.066 --> 00:24:39.866 A:middle
distribution certificate, and

00:24:39.866 --> 00:24:41.096 A:middle
all I need to do is give XCode

00:24:41.096 --> 00:24:42.286 A:middle
permission and click Next.

00:24:42.636 --> 00:24:44.626 A:middle
And XCode will generate it.

00:24:44.626 --> 00:24:46.796 A:middle
After that, XCode will ask me if

00:24:46.796 --> 00:24:48.366 A:middle
I want to export my certificate.

00:24:48.676 --> 00:24:49.746 A:middle
Like I said earlier, this is

00:24:49.746 --> 00:24:50.836 A:middle
really important, because these

00:24:50.836 --> 00:24:52.766 A:middle
are team owned assets.

00:24:52.926 --> 00:24:53.916 A:middle
And there might be other people

00:24:53.916 --> 00:24:55.126 A:middle
on my team who need to also

00:24:55.126 --> 00:24:56.036 A:middle
distribution sign.

00:24:56.406 --> 00:24:57.726 A:middle
Or I might need to reinstall the

00:24:57.726 --> 00:24:58.626 A:middle
certificate, later.

00:24:58.936 --> 00:24:59.966 A:middle
So, we really recommend

00:24:59.966 --> 00:25:01.016 A:middle
exporting a copy of your

00:25:01.016 --> 00:25:01.626 A:middle
certificate.

00:25:02.266 --> 00:25:03.786 A:middle
For now, since this is a demo,

00:25:03.786 --> 00:25:04.716 A:middle
I'll click Next.

00:25:05.656 --> 00:25:07.046 A:middle
And now, XCode's going to

00:25:07.046 --> 00:25:08.546 A:middle
continue talking to the portal,

00:25:08.796 --> 00:25:10.266 A:middle
generating my distribution

00:25:10.266 --> 00:25:11.206 A:middle
provisioning profiles.

00:25:11.206 --> 00:25:13.086 A:middle
I'll allow Codesign to use my

00:25:13.246 --> 00:25:14.266 A:middle
newly created signing

00:25:14.266 --> 00:25:14.776 A:middle
certificate.

00:25:14.776 --> 00:25:15.776 A:middle
That's how you can tell this is

00:25:15.776 --> 00:25:16.096 A:middle
live.

00:25:16.466 --> 00:25:19.926 A:middle
And once XCode is done it'll

00:25:19.926 --> 00:25:21.686 A:middle
show me details about the IPA

00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:22.336 A:middle
that it's created.

00:25:23.196 --> 00:25:24.666 A:middle
I can see all the content in my

00:25:24.666 --> 00:25:26.786 A:middle
IPA, including my framework, my

00:25:26.786 --> 00:25:28.246 A:middle
app extension, and my watch app.

00:25:28.706 --> 00:25:29.966 A:middle
Right in here I can see how

00:25:29.966 --> 00:25:31.576 A:middle
they're signed, and I can double

00:25:31.576 --> 00:25:32.596 A:middle
check that the entitlements are

00:25:32.596 --> 00:25:33.076 A:middle
correct.

00:25:33.666 --> 00:25:34.816 A:middle
So, this gives me a chance to

00:25:34.816 --> 00:25:36.856 A:middle
make sure my app is all correct

00:25:36.856 --> 00:25:38.796 A:middle
before I upload it to the App

00:25:38.796 --> 00:25:39.056 A:middle
Store.

00:25:40.206 --> 00:25:41.816 A:middle
Once I'm sure it fine, I'll

00:25:41.816 --> 00:25:43.386 A:middle
click Upload and XCode will

00:25:43.386 --> 00:25:44.626 A:middle
upload my app to the store.

00:25:45.396 --> 00:25:47.386 A:middle
Now, in the past, once this

00:25:47.386 --> 00:25:48.966 A:middle
completes this is where the

00:25:48.966 --> 00:25:50.296 A:middle
workflow would end in XCode.

00:25:51.246 --> 00:25:52.196 A:middle
But now, there's one additional

00:25:52.196 --> 00:25:53.006 A:middle
thing I can do, here.

00:25:53.256 --> 00:25:54.126 A:middle
I can export.

00:25:54.126 --> 00:25:58.526 A:middle
So, when I select Export and

00:25:58.526 --> 00:26:01.886 A:middle
save to the desktop, XCode will

00:26:01.886 --> 00:26:03.116 A:middle
generate a new directory

00:26:03.616 --> 00:26:07.486 A:middle
containing my IPA as well as all

00:26:07.486 --> 00:26:08.736 A:middle
of those other files, including

00:26:08.736 --> 00:26:10.146 A:middle
an export options PLIST that I

00:26:10.146 --> 00:26:10.886 A:middle
mentioned, earlier.

00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:14.716 A:middle
So, that's the new distribution

00:26:14.766 --> 00:26:16.676 A:middle
workflow using automatic signing

00:26:16.676 --> 00:26:17.416 A:middle
in XCode 9.

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:20.276 A:middle
Now, let's talk a little bit

00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:23.426 A:middle
about manual signing.

00:26:23.536 --> 00:26:25.256 A:middle
Manual signing also works just

00:26:25.256 --> 00:26:26.276 A:middle
like during development.

00:26:27.106 --> 00:26:28.476 A:middle
You or someone on your team will

00:26:28.476 --> 00:26:30.076 A:middle
create provisioning profiles,

00:26:30.076 --> 00:26:32.206 A:middle
and then you can select them in

00:26:32.206 --> 00:26:33.756 A:middle
the XCode distribution workflow.

00:26:34.906 --> 00:26:36.336 A:middle
XCode won't ever create or

00:26:36.336 --> 00:26:38.206 A:middle
modify any of these manual

00:26:38.206 --> 00:26:38.826 A:middle
profiles.

00:26:38.826 --> 00:26:39.896 A:middle
So, you're in full control.

00:26:41.656 --> 00:26:43.186 A:middle
This is fully compatible with

00:26:43.186 --> 00:26:43.736 A:middle
XCode Build.

00:26:43.926 --> 00:26:45.906 A:middle
So, you can still automate the

00:26:45.906 --> 00:26:47.216 A:middle
creation of your IPAs if you

00:26:47.216 --> 00:26:48.266 A:middle
want to use manual signing.

00:26:48.586 --> 00:26:49.356 A:middle
But there's one note.

00:26:49.736 --> 00:26:51.136 A:middle
If your archive was manually

00:26:51.136 --> 00:26:52.496 A:middle
signed when you built it, then

00:26:52.496 --> 00:26:53.816 A:middle
you also need to manually sign

00:26:53.816 --> 00:26:54.606 A:middle
when you distribute.

00:26:55.486 --> 00:26:56.796 A:middle
So, how do you use manual

00:26:56.796 --> 00:26:57.216 A:middle
signing?

00:26:58.736 --> 00:27:00.156 A:middle
You'll recall this screen from

00:27:00.156 --> 00:27:01.156 A:middle
my demo, a moment ago.

00:27:01.306 --> 00:27:02.786 A:middle
If you choose manual signing,

00:27:02.786 --> 00:27:03.336 A:middle
click Next.

00:27:04.526 --> 00:27:05.356 A:middle
Then, you'll be greeted with

00:27:05.356 --> 00:27:06.066 A:middle
this interface.

00:27:06.546 --> 00:27:07.906 A:middle
This is really similar to the

00:27:07.906 --> 00:27:09.706 A:middle
signing UI that you see in the

00:27:09.706 --> 00:27:11.246 A:middle
General tab in XCode's project

00:27:11.246 --> 00:27:11.616 A:middle
editor.

00:27:12.256 --> 00:27:13.446 A:middle
You can select the distribution

00:27:13.446 --> 00:27:14.566 A:middle
certificate you want to use.

00:27:14.946 --> 00:27:16.726 A:middle
And then, profiles for each of

00:27:16.726 --> 00:27:18.846 A:middle
the items in your app.

00:27:19.136 --> 00:27:20.366 A:middle
When you pop open those popup

00:27:20.366 --> 00:27:22.386 A:middle
menus, you see the profiles that

00:27:22.386 --> 00:27:23.876 A:middle
are eligible, ineligible.

00:27:23.876 --> 00:27:25.326 A:middle
You can import profiles or

00:27:25.326 --> 00:27:26.806 A:middle
download profiles form the

00:27:26.806 --> 00:27:28.346 A:middle
portal directly within the

00:27:28.346 --> 00:27:29.346 A:middle
distribution workflow.

00:27:30.176 --> 00:27:31.796 A:middle
And if you select an ineligible

00:27:31.796 --> 00:27:33.366 A:middle
profile you'll see issues

00:27:33.366 --> 00:27:34.846 A:middle
associated with that selection

00:27:35.136 --> 00:27:36.426 A:middle
right underneath your selection.

00:27:37.476 --> 00:27:38.706 A:middle
Once you've selected valid

00:27:38.706 --> 00:27:39.986 A:middle
profiles for everything in your

00:27:39.986 --> 00:27:41.136 A:middle
app, you can click Next and

00:27:41.136 --> 00:27:42.206 A:middle
continue with the workflow.

00:27:42.776 --> 00:27:45.846 A:middle
And as I said, this is all fully

00:27:45.846 --> 00:27:47.866 A:middle
compatible with XCode Build.

00:27:47.866 --> 00:27:49.236 A:middle
All you need to do is specify a

00:27:49.276 --> 00:27:50.786 A:middle
couple of additional keys in

00:27:50.786 --> 00:27:52.016 A:middle
your export options PLIST.

00:27:52.586 --> 00:27:54.006 A:middle
So, you can see here, I've set

00:27:54.006 --> 00:27:55.476 A:middle
Signing Style to manual.

00:27:56.386 --> 00:27:57.906 A:middle
And I've also provided a

00:27:57.936 --> 00:27:59.616 A:middle
provisioning profiles entry that

00:27:59.616 --> 00:28:01.586 A:middle
lists all the items in my app by

00:28:01.586 --> 00:28:03.056 A:middle
bundle identifier, and all the

00:28:03.056 --> 00:28:04.166 A:middle
profiles I want to use.

00:28:04.586 --> 00:28:05.376 A:middle
And that's it.

00:28:05.376 --> 00:28:06.896 A:middle
Now, I'm set up for automation.

00:28:07.486 --> 00:28:10.126 A:middle
So, that's the new distribution

00:28:10.126 --> 00:28:11.196 A:middle
workflow in XCode 9.

00:28:11.516 --> 00:28:12.376 A:middle
We think you're all really going

00:28:12.376 --> 00:28:12.776 A:middle
to love it.

00:28:13.056 --> 00:28:14.306 A:middle
And now, I'd like to invite

00:28:14.306 --> 00:28:15.756 A:middle
Brent onstage to talk about

00:28:15.756 --> 00:28:17.256 A:middle
distribution signing in XCode

00:28:17.256 --> 00:28:17.616 A:middle
Server.

00:28:18.516 --> 00:28:22.816 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:28:23.316 --> 00:28:24.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, everyone.

00:28:24.376 --> 00:28:25.666 A:middle
I'm really excited to be here,

00:28:25.666 --> 00:28:27.096 A:middle
today, because for the first

00:28:27.096 --> 00:28:28.796 A:middle
time in public we're going to

00:28:28.796 --> 00:28:30.116 A:middle
show you how you can use an

00:28:30.116 --> 00:28:32.606 A:middle
XCode Server to automatically

00:28:32.606 --> 00:28:34.786 A:middle
create distribution signed IPAs

00:28:34.786 --> 00:28:35.196 A:middle
for you.

00:28:35.196 --> 00:28:36.186 A:middle
This is really exciting.

00:28:36.406 --> 00:28:37.226 A:middle
It's a missing piece of the

00:28:37.226 --> 00:28:39.086 A:middle
puzzle and we finally delivered

00:28:39.086 --> 00:28:40.226 A:middle
it, and it's really great.

00:28:40.766 --> 00:28:43.026 A:middle
But first, how did we do this?

00:28:43.766 --> 00:28:45.606 A:middle
Well, in XCode 8 and XCode 9, we

00:28:45.606 --> 00:28:47.236 A:middle
introduced great automatic

00:28:47.276 --> 00:28:48.456 A:middle
signing workflows in XCode.

00:28:48.876 --> 00:28:50.216 A:middle
And XCode Server gets all of

00:28:50.216 --> 00:28:51.066 A:middle
that for free.

00:28:51.726 --> 00:28:53.076 A:middle
Likewise, all of the

00:28:53.076 --> 00:28:54.596 A:middle
distribution workflows and that

00:28:54.596 --> 00:28:56.786 A:middle
underlying technology, XCode

00:28:56.786 --> 00:28:58.226 A:middle
Server also gets that from

00:28:58.226 --> 00:28:58.596 A:middle
XCode.

00:28:58.966 --> 00:29:00.456 A:middle
So, we have automatic signing,

00:29:00.666 --> 00:29:02.086 A:middle
we have distribution, we have

00:29:02.086 --> 00:29:03.586 A:middle
XCode Server, we have great

00:29:03.586 --> 00:29:05.006 A:middle
workflows for development.

00:29:05.006 --> 00:29:06.126 A:middle
And distribution signing.

00:29:06.126 --> 00:29:09.866 A:middle
How does this all work?

00:29:10.066 --> 00:29:11.676 A:middle
So, Chris showed you a slide

00:29:11.676 --> 00:29:12.746 A:middle
that looked a little bit like

00:29:12.816 --> 00:29:13.116 A:middle
this.

00:29:13.456 --> 00:29:14.676 A:middle
And it's important to understand

00:29:14.786 --> 00:29:16.526 A:middle
how XCode Server does this job.

00:29:16.526 --> 00:29:21.086 A:middle
In order to sign an archive to

00:29:21.086 --> 00:29:22.306 A:middle
create an IPA from it for

00:29:22.306 --> 00:29:24.336 A:middle
distribution, XCode Server needs

00:29:24.336 --> 00:29:25.316 A:middle
some special assets.

00:29:25.716 --> 00:29:27.126 A:middle
Just like for development, it

00:29:27.126 --> 00:29:28.486 A:middle
needs signing certificates and

00:29:28.486 --> 00:29:30.056 A:middle
it needs provisioning profiles.

00:29:30.606 --> 00:29:32.336 A:middle
Now fortunately, we've made this

00:29:32.336 --> 00:29:32.896 A:middle
very easy.

00:29:33.446 --> 00:29:34.776 A:middle
If you allow XCode Server to

00:29:34.776 --> 00:29:36.136 A:middle
communicate with the developer

00:29:36.136 --> 00:29:38.806 A:middle
portal on your behalf, it can

00:29:38.806 --> 00:29:39.896 A:middle
get most of these things for

00:29:39.896 --> 00:29:40.066 A:middle
you.

00:29:40.066 --> 00:29:40.826 A:middle
It can get the provisioning

00:29:40.826 --> 00:29:42.266 A:middle
profiles automatically.

00:29:43.116 --> 00:29:44.106 A:middle
But there's one thing it can't

00:29:44.106 --> 00:29:45.626 A:middle
get, and that's the distribution

00:29:45.826 --> 00:29:46.606 A:middle
signing certificate.

00:29:47.336 --> 00:29:48.086 A:middle
That's really no big deal,

00:29:48.086 --> 00:29:49.186 A:middle
because we provide a great

00:29:49.186 --> 00:29:50.476 A:middle
experience for you to share this

00:29:50.476 --> 00:29:51.096 A:middle
with your server.

00:29:51.696 --> 00:29:53.896 A:middle
So, once your XCode Server has

00:29:53.896 --> 00:29:55.666 A:middle
all of these assets it can build

00:29:55.666 --> 00:29:56.226 A:middle
an archive.

00:29:56.226 --> 00:29:57.556 A:middle
And then, it can transform that

00:29:57.556 --> 00:30:00.066 A:middle
archive into an IPA for

00:30:00.226 --> 00:30:01.906 A:middle
distribution to the App Store.

00:30:02.046 --> 00:30:07.606 A:middle
So, what do you need to do?

00:30:08.186 --> 00:30:09.326 A:middle
You need to copy distribution

00:30:09.326 --> 00:30:10.586 A:middle
certificates to the server.

00:30:11.056 --> 00:30:12.596 A:middle
You need to make sure that

00:30:12.596 --> 00:30:14.266 A:middle
automatic signing is turned on.

00:30:14.266 --> 00:30:15.306 A:middle
But this will also work for

00:30:15.306 --> 00:30:15.746 A:middle
manual.

00:30:15.746 --> 00:30:16.306 A:middle
I'll show you that.

00:30:16.886 --> 00:30:17.936 A:middle
And then, thirdly, there's this

00:30:17.936 --> 00:30:19.686 A:middle
export options PLIST that I

00:30:19.686 --> 00:30:20.296 A:middle
talked to you about.

00:30:20.506 --> 00:30:22.766 A:middle
So, what's that all about?

00:30:22.766 --> 00:30:24.146 A:middle
Well, the export options PLIST

00:30:24.146 --> 00:30:25.856 A:middle
is just a simple recipe for how

00:30:25.856 --> 00:30:27.216 A:middle
you want XCode Server to

00:30:27.216 --> 00:30:29.086 A:middle
transform your archive into an

00:30:29.126 --> 00:30:29.446 A:middle
IPA.

00:30:29.786 --> 00:30:30.896 A:middle
They can be very simple, and the

00:30:30.896 --> 00:30:32.656 A:middle
can also scale up to some more

00:30:32.816 --> 00:30:34.446 A:middle
complex manual signing

00:30:34.826 --> 00:30:35.486 A:middle
scenarios, too.

00:30:37.006 --> 00:30:38.006 A:middle
So, I've been saying App Store a

00:30:38.006 --> 00:30:39.436 A:middle
lot, but I want to emphasize

00:30:39.856 --> 00:30:41.516 A:middle
that what we've built here, lets

00:30:41.516 --> 00:30:43.766 A:middle
you distribute for all of the

00:30:43.766 --> 00:30:44.526 A:middle
distribution methods.

00:30:44.526 --> 00:30:45.576 A:middle
So, if you're doing enterprise

00:30:45.896 --> 00:30:47.086 A:middle
or ad hoc or App Store, or

00:30:47.086 --> 00:30:48.286 A:middle
whatever, this would just work.

00:30:48.516 --> 00:30:49.266 A:middle
So, we think that's really

00:30:49.266 --> 00:30:49.486 A:middle
great.

00:30:50.796 --> 00:30:51.976 A:middle
So, let's see this in action.

00:30:58.836 --> 00:31:00.536 A:middle
So, here's our ChocolateChip Bot

00:31:00.536 --> 00:31:01.916 A:middle
that's been dutifully building

00:31:01.916 --> 00:31:04.126 A:middle
our app and running tests on

00:31:04.126 --> 00:31:05.606 A:middle
devices for two months, now.

00:31:06.236 --> 00:31:07.316 A:middle
So, what I want to do is I want

00:31:07.316 --> 00:31:09.706 A:middle
to repurpose this Bot to build

00:31:10.226 --> 00:31:11.306 A:middle
IPAs for me.

00:31:11.756 --> 00:31:13.316 A:middle
Now, we recommend as a best

00:31:13.316 --> 00:31:14.196 A:middle
practice that you create a

00:31:14.196 --> 00:31:15.916 A:middle
dedicated Bot for this purpose,

00:31:15.986 --> 00:31:17.166 A:middle
for creating IPAs.

00:31:17.376 --> 00:31:18.266 A:middle
But I'm just going to repurpose

00:31:18.266 --> 00:31:19.926 A:middle
this one for demo purposed,

00:31:19.926 --> 00:31:20.286 A:middle
today.

00:31:20.756 --> 00:31:22.326 A:middle
So, we'll go and edit the Bot.

00:31:22.806 --> 00:31:23.636 A:middle
There a lot of options in the

00:31:23.636 --> 00:31:24.216 A:middle
Bot editor.

00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:25.446 A:middle
But what we need to do today is

00:31:25.446 --> 00:31:26.036 A:middle
pretty simple.

00:31:26.546 --> 00:31:27.756 A:middle
First, we're going to visit the

00:31:27.756 --> 00:31:28.676 A:middle
Configuration tab.

00:31:29.106 --> 00:31:30.496 A:middle
And in here, we're going to turn

00:31:30.496 --> 00:31:31.376 A:middle
on Archiving.

00:31:32.136 --> 00:31:33.656 A:middle
Now, ever since XCode 5, when we

00:31:33.656 --> 00:31:35.226 A:middle
introduced XCode Server, it's

00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:36.786 A:middle
been able to create archives for

00:31:36.786 --> 00:31:36.976 A:middle
you.

00:31:36.976 --> 00:31:37.866 A:middle
And there have been a lot of

00:31:37.866 --> 00:31:38.906 A:middle
great workflows, there.

00:31:39.326 --> 00:31:40.376 A:middle
For example, you can create

00:31:40.376 --> 00:31:41.506 A:middle
archives and then do

00:31:41.626 --> 00:31:43.166 A:middle
over-the-air installs with XCode

00:31:43.166 --> 00:31:43.496 A:middle
Server.

00:31:43.496 --> 00:31:44.426 A:middle
And that's been great.

00:31:44.426 --> 00:31:45.506 A:middle
You can still do that.

00:31:45.756 --> 00:31:47.556 A:middle
But there's one new option that

00:31:47.556 --> 00:31:48.316 A:middle
we've added, here.

00:31:48.776 --> 00:31:50.076 A:middle
And that's what enables XCode

00:31:50.076 --> 00:31:51.486 A:middle
Server to create this

00:31:51.486 --> 00:31:53.806 A:middle
distribution signed IPA for you.

00:31:54.306 --> 00:31:55.256 A:middle
So, that's the final option,

00:31:55.256 --> 00:31:55.456 A:middle
here.

00:31:55.706 --> 00:31:57.606 A:middle
Use custom export options PLIST.

00:31:57.606 --> 00:31:59.086 A:middle
Well, where do I get one of

00:31:59.086 --> 00:31:59.356 A:middle
those?

00:32:00.326 --> 00:32:01.626 A:middle
Itai, being the great guy that

00:32:01.626 --> 00:32:03.836 A:middle
he is, you may remember he

00:32:03.836 --> 00:32:05.756 A:middle
exported that for me after he

00:32:05.756 --> 00:32:07.196 A:middle
uploaded his app to the App

00:32:07.196 --> 00:32:07.516 A:middle
Store.

00:32:07.986 --> 00:32:09.406 A:middle
So, I'll go and I'll select

00:32:09.406 --> 00:32:09.756 A:middle
that, now.

00:32:10.256 --> 00:32:12.186 A:middle
So, it's a good idea at this

00:32:12.186 --> 00:32:13.716 A:middle
point, that you verify that this

00:32:13.716 --> 00:32:14.756 A:middle
is the right export options

00:32:14.756 --> 00:32:15.116 A:middle
PLIST.

00:32:15.116 --> 00:32:16.826 A:middle
So, conveniently, you can just

00:32:16.826 --> 00:32:17.276 A:middle
click like it.

00:32:17.986 --> 00:32:19.556 A:middle
This is a pretty simple example

00:32:19.806 --> 00:32:21.146 A:middle
of an export options PLIST.

00:32:21.566 --> 00:32:22.856 A:middle
But you may remember from one of

00:32:22.856 --> 00:32:25.196 A:middle
Itai's slides, if you have some

00:32:25.226 --> 00:32:26.986 A:middle
more complex manual workflows

00:32:27.486 --> 00:32:29.356 A:middle
you would end up, perhaps,

00:32:29.516 --> 00:32:30.776 A:middle
having specific provisioning

00:32:30.776 --> 00:32:31.916 A:middle
profiles, here.

00:32:31.956 --> 00:32:33.186 A:middle
And other things you can do.

00:32:33.186 --> 00:32:33.976 A:middle
So, it's a good idea.

00:32:33.976 --> 00:32:34.926 A:middle
Just verify that this is the

00:32:34.926 --> 00:32:36.266 A:middle
right export options PLIST.

00:32:36.806 --> 00:32:37.466 A:middle
So, we've done that.

00:32:37.466 --> 00:32:39.216 A:middle
And that's it for the

00:32:39.216 --> 00:32:40.036 A:middle
Configuration tab.

00:32:40.876 --> 00:32:41.936 A:middle
Let's visit the Signing tab.

00:32:43.256 --> 00:32:44.536 A:middle
So, this is brand new in XCode

00:32:44.536 --> 00:32:45.536 A:middle
9, and we're pretty excited.

00:32:45.536 --> 00:32:46.606 A:middle
Because this is how you

00:32:46.606 --> 00:32:48.516 A:middle
configure XCode Server to do

00:32:48.616 --> 00:32:49.676 A:middle
both development signing and

00:32:49.676 --> 00:32:50.516 A:middle
distribution signing.

00:32:51.066 --> 00:32:53.496 A:middle
So, these two checkboxes at the

00:32:53.496 --> 00:32:54.766 A:middle
top, Chris already checked for

00:32:54.766 --> 00:32:54.976 A:middle
us.

00:32:55.226 --> 00:32:56.536 A:middle
And remember, the top one lets

00:32:56.536 --> 00:32:57.796 A:middle
XCode Server communicate with

00:32:57.796 --> 00:32:59.306 A:middle
the developer website on my

00:32:59.306 --> 00:32:59.756 A:middle
behalf.

00:33:00.206 --> 00:33:01.396 A:middle
My team is already added to the

00:33:01.396 --> 00:33:01.786 A:middle
server.

00:33:01.966 --> 00:33:03.766 A:middle
And even if you have a manual

00:33:03.766 --> 00:33:05.246 A:middle
distribution workflow, it's

00:33:05.246 --> 00:33:06.416 A:middle
really a good idea that you

00:33:06.416 --> 00:33:07.426 A:middle
still have this checkbox

00:33:07.576 --> 00:33:07.756 A:middle
checked.

00:33:08.206 --> 00:33:10.006 A:middle
So, now let's visit the

00:33:10.006 --> 00:33:11.496 A:middle
Certificates and Profiles tab.

00:33:12.146 --> 00:33:12.726 A:middle
So, what's in here?

00:33:13.226 --> 00:33:14.886 A:middle
There are two tables at the top.

00:33:15.456 --> 00:33:16.596 A:middle
Shows me all the certificates

00:33:16.596 --> 00:33:17.426 A:middle
that are installed on this

00:33:17.426 --> 00:33:17.816 A:middle
machine.

00:33:17.816 --> 00:33:18.906 A:middle
And the bottom are the

00:33:18.906 --> 00:33:19.816 A:middle
provisioning profiles.

00:33:20.356 --> 00:33:21.436 A:middle
And what I need to do, is I need

00:33:21.436 --> 00:33:23.026 A:middle
to share the distribution

00:33:23.026 --> 00:33:24.106 A:middle
certificate with my server.

00:33:24.656 --> 00:33:25.346 A:middle
That's real easy.

00:33:25.726 --> 00:33:27.206 A:middle
Just click add the server, and

00:33:27.206 --> 00:33:27.526 A:middle
it's done.

00:33:27.726 --> 00:33:28.626 A:middle
That's all I need to do.

00:33:28.626 --> 00:33:30.416 A:middle
And now, XCode Server has access

00:33:30.416 --> 00:33:31.146 A:middle
to that distribution

00:33:31.146 --> 00:33:31.716 A:middle
certificate.

00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:33.186 A:middle
And because I've allowed it to

00:33:33.186 --> 00:33:34.556 A:middle
talk to the developer website on

00:33:34.556 --> 00:33:36.406 A:middle
my behalf, it can get all the

00:33:36.406 --> 00:33:38.256 A:middle
assets it needs to create that

00:33:38.256 --> 00:33:38.466 A:middle
IPA.

00:33:38.826 --> 00:33:41.226 A:middle
You may be wondering what I need

00:33:41.226 --> 00:33:42.346 A:middle
to do with the provisioning

00:33:42.436 --> 00:33:43.156 A:middle
profiles table.

00:33:43.156 --> 00:33:44.436 A:middle
Well, for most of you if you're

00:33:44.436 --> 00:33:45.776 A:middle
doing automatic code signing,

00:33:45.776 --> 00:33:46.876 A:middle
and you're doing App Store

00:33:46.876 --> 00:33:48.166 A:middle
distribution, you don't need to

00:33:48.166 --> 00:33:48.706 A:middle
do anything.

00:33:49.156 --> 00:33:50.606 A:middle
But if you're targeting one of

00:33:50.606 --> 00:33:51.626 A:middle
those other distribution

00:33:51.626 --> 00:33:53.776 A:middle
methods, or you've specified

00:33:53.776 --> 00:33:55.236 A:middle
particular profiles in that

00:33:55.236 --> 00:33:56.566 A:middle
export options PLIST that we

00:33:56.566 --> 00:33:56.966 A:middle
looked at.

00:33:57.516 --> 00:33:58.576 A:middle
You're on the hook for making

00:33:58.576 --> 00:33:59.726 A:middle
sure your server has those

00:33:59.726 --> 00:34:00.716 A:middle
provisioning profiles.

00:34:01.136 --> 00:34:02.136 A:middle
Again, that's really easy.

00:34:02.486 --> 00:34:03.706 A:middle
Any profile you want to share,

00:34:03.806 --> 00:34:04.946 A:middle
you just click Add the Server,

00:34:04.946 --> 00:34:06.206 A:middle
and that will share it with your

00:34:06.206 --> 00:34:06.746 A:middle
XCode Server.

00:34:07.506 --> 00:34:08.146 A:middle
So, that's it.

00:34:08.526 --> 00:34:10.026 A:middle
I've visited the Signing tab and

00:34:10.026 --> 00:34:11.056 A:middle
the Configuration tab.

00:34:11.056 --> 00:34:12.636 A:middle
And now, this is the moment

00:34:12.636 --> 00:34:13.366 A:middle
you've been waiting for.

00:34:13.476 --> 00:34:15.156 A:middle
Let's integrate this Bot and

00:34:15.196 --> 00:34:16.956 A:middle
watch it create two things.

00:34:16.956 --> 00:34:17.936 A:middle
It's going to create an archive.

00:34:17.986 --> 00:34:18.856 A:middle
And then, it's going to

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:21.236 A:middle
transform that archive into a

00:34:21.236 --> 00:34:23.326 A:middle
distribution signed IPA that I

00:34:23.326 --> 00:34:24.466 A:middle
can then upload to the App

00:34:24.466 --> 00:34:24.756 A:middle
Store.

00:34:30.166 --> 00:34:31.036 A:middle
And there it is.

00:34:31.256 --> 00:34:32.296 A:middle
So, for the first time.

00:34:32.576 --> 00:34:33.936 A:middle
This is a really exciting

00:34:33.936 --> 00:34:35.606 A:middle
development in XCode Server, and

00:34:35.726 --> 00:34:36.746 A:middle
it's going to save you a lot of

00:34:36.746 --> 00:34:36.976 A:middle
time.

00:34:37.516 --> 00:34:44.986 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:34:45.486 --> 00:34:46.216 A:middle
So, code signing.

00:34:46.366 --> 00:34:47.546 A:middle
Code signing is really

00:34:47.546 --> 00:34:48.106 A:middle
important.

00:34:48.476 --> 00:34:49.626 A:middle
And we should feel fortunate as

00:34:49.626 --> 00:34:51.316 A:middle
developers and users that we're

00:34:51.316 --> 00:34:52.516 A:middle
using platforms where code

00:34:52.516 --> 00:34:54.416 A:middle
signing is an integral part of

00:34:54.416 --> 00:34:55.056 A:middle
the experience.

00:34:55.856 --> 00:34:56.866 A:middle
It keeps us safe.

00:34:57.256 --> 00:34:58.176 A:middle
It keeps us secure.

00:34:58.686 --> 00:34:59.636 A:middle
We know it's hard to get right.

00:35:00.006 --> 00:35:02.176 A:middle
But in XCode 8 and XCode 9 we've

00:35:02.176 --> 00:35:04.006 A:middle
put a ton of work into providing

00:35:04.006 --> 00:35:05.296 A:middle
really great solutions for you.

00:35:05.296 --> 00:35:06.536 A:middle
And we think it's easier than

00:35:06.536 --> 00:35:06.776 A:middle
ever.

00:35:07.446 --> 00:35:08.866 A:middle
So, we have development signing

00:35:08.866 --> 00:35:10.316 A:middle
with XCode Server, for your day

00:35:10.316 --> 00:35:11.086 A:middle
to day development.

00:35:11.356 --> 00:35:12.396 A:middle
And testing on devices.

00:35:13.956 --> 00:35:15.126 A:middle
We've also done a lot of work

00:35:15.126 --> 00:35:16.266 A:middle
for manual signing, because we

00:35:16.266 --> 00:35:17.206 A:middle
know that's important to a lot

00:35:17.206 --> 00:35:17.456 A:middle
of you.

00:35:17.616 --> 00:35:20.696 A:middle
We've made bit improvements to

00:35:20.696 --> 00:35:21.826 A:middle
the distribution workflow in

00:35:21.826 --> 00:35:22.276 A:middle
XCode.

00:35:22.626 --> 00:35:23.876 A:middle
And of course, we've brought

00:35:23.876 --> 00:35:25.416 A:middle
that distribution workflow to

00:35:25.416 --> 00:35:26.076 A:middle
XCode Server.

00:35:27.246 --> 00:35:27.746 A:middle
So, that's it.

00:35:27.746 --> 00:35:30.016 A:middle
There are a lot more related

00:35:30.016 --> 00:35:31.126 A:middle
session, this week, no this

00:35:31.126 --> 00:35:31.746 A:middle
topic.

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:32.866 A:middle
Thanks for attending.

00:35:33.116 --> 00:35:33.776 A:middle
Have a great week.
