00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.966 A:middle
&gt;&gt; In the next 10 minutes, we

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.356 A:middle
will learn how to use alerts to

00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:27.366 A:middle
make your app better, your users

00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:29.596 A:middle
happier, and your ratings and

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:30.616 A:middle
revenues higher.

00:00:31.386 --> 00:00:32.816 A:middle
Good alerts can accomplish that

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:34.746 A:middle
because they are one of the most

00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:36.766 A:middle
efficient problem-solving tools

00:00:36.916 --> 00:00:37.976 A:middle
at your disposal.

00:00:38.646 --> 00:00:40.236 A:middle
They help people enjoy your app,

00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:42.986 A:middle
and navigate it easily, instead

00:00:42.986 --> 00:00:44.346 A:middle
of getting stuck in some

00:00:44.346 --> 00:00:46.306 A:middle
suboptimal state, getting

00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:48.976 A:middle
frustrated, confused, quitting

00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:50.606 A:middle
your app, de-installing your

00:00:50.606 --> 00:00:52.306 A:middle
app, and giving you one-star

00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:52.896 A:middle
ratings.

00:00:53.706 --> 00:00:56.096 A:middle
So how do you create alerts that

00:00:56.096 --> 00:00:56.386 A:middle
work?

00:00:57.286 --> 00:00:58.916 A:middle
Before you get to the creating

00:00:58.916 --> 00:01:01.846 A:middle
part, you should ask yourself a

00:01:01.846 --> 00:01:03.256 A:middle
very important question.

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:06.006 A:middle
Should I be using an alert at

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:06.516 A:middle
all?

00:01:07.226 --> 00:01:09.076 A:middle
Is this the best way to achieve

00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:09.666 A:middle
my goal?

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:12.466 A:middle
Let's look at some examples of

00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.266 A:middle
good alert use.

00:01:15.246 --> 00:01:16.626 A:middle
The most common one you are

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:18.606 A:middle
familiar with is to correct

00:01:18.606 --> 00:01:20.086 A:middle
errors, like this one.

00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.836 A:middle
Alerts are also used to request

00:01:24.836 --> 00:01:27.306 A:middle
access to user data, such as

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:30.156 A:middle
contacts, location, or financial

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:30.966 A:middle
information.

00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:33.396 A:middle
We provided a format for your

00:01:33.396 --> 00:01:35.536 A:middle
use, and put a lot of thought in

00:01:35.536 --> 00:01:36.346 A:middle
its content.

00:01:37.126 --> 00:01:38.836 A:middle
It explains concisely and

00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:41.126 A:middle
clearly what data is requested,

00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:42.616 A:middle
and how it will be used.

00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:48.166 A:middle
Alerts are also used to notify

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:50.906 A:middle
people of major updates, such as

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:53.146 A:middle
significant feature releases, or

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:54.756 A:middle
critical security fixes.

00:01:55.586 --> 00:01:56.896 A:middle
These announcements should be

00:01:56.896 --> 00:01:59.096 A:middle
used judiciously and sparingly.

00:01:59.806 --> 00:02:02.326 A:middle
Reserve them only for problems

00:02:02.326 --> 00:02:04.096 A:middle
that merit immediate attention

00:02:04.486 --> 00:02:06.056 A:middle
or features that would really

00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:08.736 A:middle
benefit your audience, certainly

00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:10.396 A:middle
not every update merits an

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:13.146 A:middle
alert, and on that note, let's

00:02:13.186 --> 00:02:14.646 A:middle
talk about when alerts should

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:15.456 A:middle
not be used.

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:19.616 A:middle
I will introduce this topic with

00:02:19.616 --> 00:02:21.546 A:middle
a very important point I would

00:02:21.546 --> 00:02:22.696 A:middle
like you to remember.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:26.886 A:middle
Alerts are disruptive by design.

00:02:26.886 --> 00:02:29.836 A:middle
Oops, what are you doing here?

00:02:29.836 --> 00:02:31.066 A:middle
Can't you see I'm in the middle

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:31.646 A:middle
of a talk?

00:02:32.956 --> 00:02:34.246 A:middle
Don't you wish you could do this

00:02:34.316 --> 00:02:35.676 A:middle
to all annoying alerts?

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.356 A:middle
So the lesson here is, do not

00:02:38.356 --> 00:02:40.146 A:middle
use alerts for non-essential

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:40.866 A:middle
content.

00:02:41.686 --> 00:02:43.566 A:middle
Before putting any content in an

00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:46.616 A:middle
alert, ask yourself, do people

00:02:46.616 --> 00:02:48.556 A:middle
really need to know this, and do

00:02:48.556 --> 00:02:49.846 A:middle
they need to know this now.

00:02:50.776 --> 00:02:52.486 A:middle
If the answer to that question

00:02:52.886 --> 00:02:54.476 A:middle
is not an absolute resounding

00:02:54.476 --> 00:02:56.486 A:middle
yes, do not interrupt your

00:02:56.486 --> 00:02:56.986 A:middle
audience.

00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:01.376 A:middle
The next important point I would

00:03:01.376 --> 00:03:03.276 A:middle
like you to remember is that

00:03:03.276 --> 00:03:05.506 A:middle
alerts are lightweight by

00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:06.286 A:middle
design.

00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:09.566 A:middle
Their small format reflects and

00:03:09.566 --> 00:03:11.066 A:middle
serves the purpose of

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.916 A:middle
facilitating quick, informed

00:03:12.996 --> 00:03:15.786 A:middle
decisions, so that people can

00:03:15.786 --> 00:03:17.836 A:middle
make a choice, and move on with

00:03:17.836 --> 00:03:19.026 A:middle
whatever they were doing.

00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:22.166 A:middle
Therefore, do not overload

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:24.996 A:middle
alerts with lengthy content, or

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:26.106 A:middle
too many choices.

00:03:26.756 --> 00:03:29.026 A:middle
These tasks are better left to

00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:30.456 A:middle
larger UI elements.

00:03:30.826 --> 00:03:32.506 A:middle
Let's look at some examples.

00:03:34.856 --> 00:03:37.296 A:middle
Alerts are not settings, nor are

00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:38.926 A:middle
they multiple choice questions.

00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:42.146 A:middle
You can see that the actions are

00:03:42.146 --> 00:03:43.416 A:middle
struggling to fit into the

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:45.556 A:middle
provided format, and here is a

00:03:45.556 --> 00:03:46.416 A:middle
hint for you.

00:03:47.216 --> 00:03:49.126 A:middle
If your alert takes most of the

00:03:49.126 --> 00:03:51.276 A:middle
supported view port, it is time

00:03:51.276 --> 00:03:53.516 A:middle
to cut down or relegate some of

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:55.526 A:middle
the tasks to larger elements.

00:03:58.416 --> 00:04:00.636 A:middle
Alerts are full-scale diagnostic

00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:01.086 A:middle
tools.

00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:04.286 A:middle
Do not use them to expose

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:06.606 A:middle
technical data, especially error

00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:07.056 A:middle
codes.

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:11.116 A:middle
Alerts are not afterthoughts.

00:04:11.676 --> 00:04:13.326 A:middle
Do not use them to fix

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:14.516 A:middle
preventable problems.

00:04:15.236 --> 00:04:16.726 A:middle
For example, if you have

00:04:16.816 --> 00:04:19.116 A:middle
password rules, articulate them

00:04:19.116 --> 00:04:21.196 A:middle
clearly on the main screen.

00:04:21.726 --> 00:04:23.996 A:middle
You can also disallow invalid

00:04:24.036 --> 00:04:25.006 A:middle
character input.

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:28.206 A:middle
However, the thing to not do is

00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:30.286 A:middle
to make users memorize a long,

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:32.076 A:middle
complicated list of characters,

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:34.096 A:middle
and then go back to fix the

00:04:34.136 --> 00:04:35.736 A:middle
problem that should not have

00:04:35.736 --> 00:04:37.126 A:middle
occurred in the first place.

00:04:40.366 --> 00:04:42.146 A:middle
To summarize, the dos and don'ts

00:04:42.146 --> 00:04:44.336 A:middle
of alerts, use them to correct

00:04:44.336 --> 00:04:46.686 A:middle
errors, request access to

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:49.756 A:middle
customer data, or notify people

00:04:49.796 --> 00:04:50.906 A:middle
of major updates.

00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:54.026 A:middle
Do not use them for

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:55.166 A:middle
non-essential or lengthy

00:04:55.166 --> 00:04:55.826 A:middle
content.

00:04:56.476 --> 00:04:57.816 A:middle
Do not offer complicated

00:04:57.856 --> 00:04:58.436 A:middle
choices.

00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:00.596 A:middle
And do not duplicate the tasks

00:05:01.046 --> 00:05:02.616 A:middle
of other UI elements.

00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:05.826 A:middle
Now, you have considered all

00:05:05.826 --> 00:05:07.926 A:middle
these factors and decided that

00:05:07.926 --> 00:05:09.336 A:middle
you need an alert after all.

00:05:10.296 --> 00:05:12.486 A:middle
So how do you go about writing a

00:05:12.526 --> 00:05:13.376 A:middle
successful one?

00:05:14.316 --> 00:05:16.016 A:middle
It turns out that the structure

00:05:16.016 --> 00:05:17.936 A:middle
of the alert, with its clear

00:05:17.936 --> 00:05:19.806 A:middle
separation of visual elements

00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:22.426 A:middle
already sets you on this path of

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:22.876 A:middle
success.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.166 A:middle
Let's go back to our good alert

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:28.736 A:middle
example, and see how we can make

00:05:28.736 --> 00:05:29.836 A:middle
use of that structure.

00:05:30.586 --> 00:05:34.596 A:middle
In the title, state your main

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:37.096 A:middle
point in one sentence or less.

00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:41.746 A:middle
In the message details, provide

00:05:41.746 --> 00:05:43.546 A:middle
brief additional information if

00:05:43.546 --> 00:05:45.646 A:middle
necessary, such as the cause of

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:47.436 A:middle
the error, or the reason for

00:05:47.436 --> 00:05:48.246 A:middle
your request.

00:05:50.596 --> 00:05:52.726 A:middle
Offer actions that are easy to

00:05:52.726 --> 00:05:54.076 A:middle
understand and perform.

00:05:54.926 --> 00:05:56.346 A:middle
If you have to take people

00:05:56.386 --> 00:05:58.326 A:middle
outside the app, or to a

00:05:58.326 --> 00:06:00.306 A:middle
different state, make sure to

00:06:00.306 --> 00:06:01.416 A:middle
navigate them there.

00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:03.416 A:middle
Do not leave this job to the

00:06:03.416 --> 00:06:05.226 A:middle
Back button, the Home button,

00:06:05.326 --> 00:06:07.656 A:middle
the main screen, or otherwise

00:06:08.016 --> 00:06:09.586 A:middle
leave users to find their way.

00:06:11.626 --> 00:06:13.446 A:middle
If people scan the title and the

00:06:13.446 --> 00:06:15.876 A:middle
actions, ideally, they should be

00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:17.446 A:middle
able to understand what is going

00:06:17.446 --> 00:06:19.196 A:middle
on without paying too much

00:06:19.196 --> 00:06:20.296 A:middle
attention to the message

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:20.946 A:middle
details.

00:06:21.646 --> 00:06:22.646 A:middle
While this is not always

00:06:22.646 --> 00:06:24.666 A:middle
possible, it is a good goal to

00:06:24.666 --> 00:06:25.686 A:middle
aspire to.

00:06:27.766 --> 00:06:29.286 A:middle
And if you need a quick mnemonic

00:06:29.286 --> 00:06:31.876 A:middle
rule, a good alert answers three

00:06:31.876 --> 00:06:32.736 A:middle
key questions.

00:06:33.456 --> 00:06:34.276 A:middle
What happened?

00:06:34.856 --> 00:06:36.216 A:middle
Why people are seeing this?

00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:38.256 A:middle
And how this should proceed

00:06:38.686 --> 00:06:40.066 A:middle
based on the information they've

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:40.616 A:middle
received.

00:06:42.396 --> 00:06:43.646 A:middle
Now that you've mastered the

00:06:43.646 --> 00:06:45.476 A:middle
structure of the alert, let's

00:06:45.516 --> 00:06:47.596 A:middle
practice and apply these

00:06:47.596 --> 00:06:49.286 A:middle
guidelines to fix some common

00:06:49.286 --> 00:06:49.826 A:middle
problems.

00:06:50.466 --> 00:06:51.476 A:middle
Let's read through this one.

00:06:52.966 --> 00:06:55.146 A:middle
"App name" cannot open this

00:06:55.276 --> 00:06:55.846 A:middle
file.

00:06:56.886 --> 00:06:58.886 A:middle
The title is accurate, but not

00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:00.006 A:middle
especially helpful.

00:07:00.876 --> 00:07:02.066 A:middle
Which file do we mean?

00:07:02.596 --> 00:07:03.606 A:middle
People may be working with

00:07:03.606 --> 00:07:04.496 A:middle
multiple files.

00:07:05.846 --> 00:07:07.446 A:middle
You may need to download the

00:07:07.446 --> 00:07:09.146 A:middle
latest available updates for the

00:07:09.176 --> 00:07:09.316 A:middle
app.

00:07:09.706 --> 00:07:11.156 A:middle
Do you want to visit the "app

00:07:11.156 --> 00:07:12.226 A:middle
name" website for more

00:07:12.226 --> 00:07:13.626 A:middle
information and troubleshooting

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:13.956 A:middle
tips?

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:16.706 A:middle
These instructions are vague and

00:07:16.706 --> 00:07:18.846 A:middle
tentative, and suggest multiple

00:07:18.846 --> 00:07:20.966 A:middle
outcomes, and that is also a lot

00:07:20.966 --> 00:07:21.626 A:middle
of text.

00:07:22.526 --> 00:07:25.946 A:middle
No. Yes. The actions are

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:28.026 A:middle
difficult to understand without

00:07:28.026 --> 00:07:29.916 A:middle
going back and reading said

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:30.996 A:middle
lengthy instructions.

00:07:31.956 --> 00:07:33.096 A:middle
Let's see how we can improve

00:07:33.096 --> 00:07:33.316 A:middle
this.

00:07:35.586 --> 00:07:37.696 A:middle
First, let's specify the file

00:07:37.696 --> 00:07:39.206 A:middle
name for clarity.

00:07:41.266 --> 00:07:43.416 A:middle
Next, let's pare down the

00:07:43.416 --> 00:07:45.386 A:middle
instructions for simplicity.

00:07:47.036 --> 00:07:49.016 A:middle
Finally, let's offer clear

00:07:49.016 --> 00:07:51.026 A:middle
actionable choices, so that

00:07:51.086 --> 00:07:52.656 A:middle
people understand what happens

00:07:53.116 --> 00:07:54.756 A:middle
when they tap on any one of

00:07:54.756 --> 00:07:55.116 A:middle
them.

00:07:56.896 --> 00:07:58.196 A:middle
Here is your before and after.

00:07:58.886 --> 00:08:01.226 A:middle
Which one do you think looks

00:08:01.796 --> 00:08:01.956 A:middle
better?

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:02.606 A:middle
Thought so.

00:08:04.956 --> 00:08:06.616 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at an

00:08:06.616 --> 00:08:08.786 A:middle
alert that seems to be written

00:08:08.786 --> 00:08:10.436 A:middle
with all the guidelines in mind.

00:08:11.686 --> 00:08:12.776 A:middle
Let's read through this one.

00:08:14.226 --> 00:08:15.746 A:middle
Cancel download?

00:08:16.816 --> 00:08:19.026 A:middle
If you cancel now, you will not

00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:20.216 A:middle
receive this file.

00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:22.596 A:middle
Cancel? Okay [laughter].

00:08:24.046 --> 00:08:25.896 A:middle
There is nothing wrong with any

00:08:25.896 --> 00:08:28.796 A:middle
individual part, the title

00:08:28.796 --> 00:08:30.886 A:middle
states the question, the message

00:08:30.936 --> 00:08:33.186 A:middle
describes the consequences, and

00:08:33.186 --> 00:08:35.246 A:middle
even the actions use the

00:08:35.246 --> 00:08:36.736 A:middle
recommended terminology.

00:08:37.086 --> 00:08:38.726 A:middle
Cancel and okay.

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:41.496 A:middle
However, this is a classic

00:08:41.496 --> 00:08:43.366 A:middle
example of a confusing alert

00:08:43.646 --> 00:08:45.666 A:middle
that happens even to the most

00:08:45.666 --> 00:08:47.006 A:middle
experienced developers.

00:08:47.856 --> 00:08:50.236 A:middle
So the lesson here is, even when

00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:52.226 A:middle
using guidelines, always check

00:08:52.276 --> 00:08:55.006 A:middle
the result for any ambiguity or

00:08:55.006 --> 00:08:55.816 A:middle
confusion.

00:08:56.576 --> 00:08:57.836 A:middle
Let's see how we can clarify

00:08:57.836 --> 00:08:58.396 A:middle
this one.

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:02.626 A:middle
First, let's rephrase the title

00:09:03.066 --> 00:09:05.446 A:middle
to remove ambiguity and mention

00:09:05.526 --> 00:09:06.806 A:middle
the filename to be more

00:09:06.806 --> 00:09:07.456 A:middle
specific.

00:09:09.446 --> 00:09:11.426 A:middle
Next, let's apply similar

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:13.066 A:middle
changes to the message details.

00:09:14.766 --> 00:09:16.276 A:middle
And for good measure, let's

00:09:16.276 --> 00:09:17.716 A:middle
reiterate the choices and the

00:09:17.716 --> 00:09:19.566 A:middle
actions, so people understand

00:09:19.566 --> 00:09:21.406 A:middle
what happens if they click on

00:09:21.406 --> 00:09:22.086 A:middle
any of them.

00:09:24.136 --> 00:09:25.466 A:middle
Here is your before and after.

00:09:26.086 --> 00:09:28.216 A:middle
And I hope you would agree that

00:09:28.456 --> 00:09:29.696 A:middle
the after looks a bit better

00:09:29.696 --> 00:09:30.406 A:middle
than the before.

00:09:33.316 --> 00:09:34.876 A:middle
Now, you have learned how to

00:09:34.876 --> 00:09:37.246 A:middle
make use of the structure, let's

00:09:37.246 --> 00:09:38.406 A:middle
talk a bit about style and

00:09:38.406 --> 00:09:39.206 A:middle
quality.

00:09:39.606 --> 00:09:42.616 A:middle
Here, I have a couple of tips

00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:43.916 A:middle
for you.

00:09:44.206 --> 00:09:46.416 A:middle
Avoid platitudes, jargon or

00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:46.996 A:middle
fillers.

00:09:47.396 --> 00:09:48.896 A:middle
All they do is take space

00:09:48.896 --> 00:09:51.026 A:middle
without adding any return value.

00:09:52.836 --> 00:09:54.336 A:middle
Use correct formatting,

00:09:54.436 --> 00:09:56.406 A:middle
spelling, and punctuation.

00:09:56.786 --> 00:09:58.296 A:middle
This seems like a very basic

00:09:58.296 --> 00:10:00.386 A:middle
piece of advice, but it will go

00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:02.246 A:middle
a very long way toward making

00:10:02.246 --> 00:10:04.446 A:middle
your alerts and your app look

00:10:04.446 --> 00:10:06.106 A:middle
polished and professional.

00:10:07.336 --> 00:10:09.466 A:middle
Finally, consider your audience.

00:10:10.086 --> 00:10:11.146 A:middle
Whether you are writing for

00:10:11.146 --> 00:10:13.176 A:middle
medical professionals, special

00:10:13.176 --> 00:10:15.206 A:middle
needs students, or even a very

00:10:15.286 --> 00:10:17.066 A:middle
smart cat who just learned how

00:10:17.066 --> 00:10:19.746 A:middle
to use an iPad, make sure that

00:10:19.746 --> 00:10:21.756 A:middle
your editorial voice matches

00:10:21.756 --> 00:10:23.446 A:middle
their needs and expectations.

00:10:25.566 --> 00:10:27.366 A:middle
In conclusion, here are the

00:10:27.366 --> 00:10:28.786 A:middle
three simple things you can do

00:10:28.786 --> 00:10:31.496 A:middle
now to make your alerts awesome.

00:10:33.426 --> 00:10:34.906 A:middle
Keep them simple and helpful.

00:10:36.456 --> 00:10:37.206 A:middle
Go practice.

00:10:37.836 --> 00:10:39.436 A:middle
Take what you learned, go

00:10:39.436 --> 00:10:41.136 A:middle
through your app, see if you

00:10:41.136 --> 00:10:42.506 A:middle
need all the alerts that you

00:10:42.506 --> 00:10:45.386 A:middle
created, and if you do, see how

00:10:45.386 --> 00:10:46.836 A:middle
you can make them work harder.

00:10:48.076 --> 00:10:50.046 A:middle
And for more information and an

alerts for iOS and macOS, read

00:10:55.316 --> 00:10:57.976 A:middle

00:10:57.976 --> 00:10:58.626 A:middle
website.

00:10:59.226 --> 00:10:59.616 A:middle
Thank you.
