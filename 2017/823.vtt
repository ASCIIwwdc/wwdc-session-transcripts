[ Applause ]

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:20.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let's talk about designing

00:00:20.356 --> 00:00:22.566 A:middle
glyphs, and I think a good place

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.916 A:middle
to start is what is a glyph?

00:00:24.536 --> 00:00:26.646 A:middle
A glyph, traditionally, is a

00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:28.346 A:middle
topographical character, but it

00:00:28.396 --> 00:00:32.306 A:middle
could also be a symbol or a

00:00:32.376 --> 00:00:33.886 A:middle
simple shape of a real world

00:00:33.886 --> 00:00:37.766 A:middle
object, or it can be a

00:00:37.956 --> 00:00:39.956 A:middle
combination of shapes to

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:41.866 A:middle
represent function or a concept.

00:00:43.136 --> 00:00:44.046 A:middle
But you might be thinking what

00:00:44.046 --> 00:00:45.666 A:middle
is the difference between this

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:46.276 A:middle
and an icon.

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:48.496 A:middle
So, to help illustrate the

00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:50.006 A:middle
difference, let's take a look at

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:51.476 A:middle
this example of four iPhone

00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:51.896 A:middle
icons.

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:56.096 A:middle
An icon can refer to a broad set

00:00:56.096 --> 00:00:58.516 A:middle
of assets ranging from simple

00:00:58.516 --> 00:00:59.766 A:middle
low fidelity shapes like you can

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.916 A:middle
see on the left to illustrative,

00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:05.756 A:middle
colorful, and highly rendered

00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:07.256 A:middle
assets that you can see on the

00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:07.546 A:middle
right.

00:01:08.796 --> 00:01:11.156 A:middle
The two assets on the left can

00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:13.866 A:middle
also be defined as glyphs, and

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:14.366 A:middle
that's because of their

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.426 A:middle
simplicity, and for the most

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:18.676 A:middle
part, glyphs are monochromatic

00:01:18.676 --> 00:01:19.686 A:middle
and should be colorized

00:01:19.686 --> 00:01:20.366 A:middle
programmatically.

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:25.866 A:middle
This is the iOS wallet app icon,

00:01:26.556 --> 00:01:27.636 A:middle
and you can see a nice use of

00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:30.176 A:middle
color and some subtle shading.

00:01:31.996 --> 00:01:33.776 A:middle
And here's the app represented

00:01:33.776 --> 00:01:34.166 A:middle
as a glyph.

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:37.526 A:middle
So, you get the idea, but let's

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:38.626 A:middle
take a look at one more example.

00:01:40.706 --> 00:01:43.576 A:middle
This is the phone app icon, and

00:01:43.576 --> 00:01:44.946 A:middle
if we take away that iconic

00:01:44.946 --> 00:01:48.846 A:middle
shape and the color, you see

00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:49.806 A:middle
where I'm going with this, we're

00:01:49.806 --> 00:01:50.636 A:middle
left with this glyph.

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:52.466 A:middle
So, in this case, the glyph is

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:53.586 A:middle
actually part of what makes up

00:01:53.586 --> 00:01:54.086 A:middle
the icon.

00:01:56.636 --> 00:01:58.836 A:middle
Now, effective glyphs have some

00:01:58.836 --> 00:01:59.706 A:middle
key characteristics.

00:02:00.906 --> 00:02:02.116 A:middle
They're highly simplified in

00:02:02.196 --> 00:02:02.556 A:middle
form.

00:02:03.996 --> 00:02:05.776 A:middle
They're conceptually universal,

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:09.266 A:middle
and they're quickly readable in

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:11.046 A:middle
context as to their function or

00:02:11.046 --> 00:02:11.426 A:middle
purpose.

00:02:15.296 --> 00:02:16.606 A:middle
Many of us have experienced

00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:17.676 A:middle
being in a foreign place,

00:02:18.636 --> 00:02:19.966 A:middle
somewhere where we don't, you

00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:21.396 A:middle
know, relate to the culture or

00:02:21.396 --> 00:02:23.746 A:middle
another language, and it can be

00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:24.696 A:middle
quite a relief when we see a

00:02:24.696 --> 00:02:25.816 A:middle
symbol that we recognize.

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:27.906 A:middle
So, in this case, you don't have

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:31.106 A:middle
to know German to know the right

00:02:31.106 --> 00:02:33.896 A:middle
way to the airport, and that's

00:02:34.016 --> 00:02:36.786 A:middle
thanks to this simple universal

00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:38.546 A:middle
shape, which in this context we

00:02:38.546 --> 00:02:40.596 A:middle
understand to represent airport.

00:02:42.216 --> 00:02:44.006 A:middle
So, glyphs are a powerful

00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:45.036 A:middle
communication tool, and that's

00:02:45.126 --> 00:02:46.156 A:middle
why we make them part of our

00:02:46.156 --> 00:02:46.976 A:middle
design language in UI.

00:02:52.436 --> 00:02:53.586 A:middle
So, let's go through a quick

00:02:53.586 --> 00:02:55.776 A:middle
exercise to conceptualize an

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:56.566 A:middle
effective glyph.

00:02:57.706 --> 00:02:58.756 A:middle
Let's say we need one to

00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:00.266 A:middle
represent delicious.

00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:02.916 A:middle
The first thing you might think

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:06.766 A:middle
of is a cheeseburger, and you

00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:07.826 A:middle
would have no argument from me.

00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:09.046 A:middle
I do think cheeseburgers are

00:03:09.046 --> 00:03:09.566 A:middle
delicious.

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:12.486 A:middle
But believe it or not, some

00:03:12.486 --> 00:03:13.726 A:middle
people do not like

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:14.256 A:middle
cheeseburgers.

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:15.796 A:middle
So, what's better than a

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:16.316 A:middle
cheeseburger?

00:03:17.816 --> 00:03:20.716 A:middle
Pizza? I see some people shaking

00:03:20.716 --> 00:03:21.056 A:middle
their heads.

00:03:21.056 --> 00:03:21.866 A:middle
I don't know.

00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:23.836 A:middle
Okay. I think I got one that we

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:24.906 A:middle
can all relate to.

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:26.006 A:middle
How about ice cream?

00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:29.066 A:middle
No. Well, all right, well, I

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:30.336 A:middle
think I could -- you got the

00:03:30.336 --> 00:03:32.246 A:middle
idea here -- not everyone

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:34.776 A:middle
relates to these specific food

00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:36.106 A:middle
items in the same way.

00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:39.076 A:middle
So, these aren't effective.

00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:40.216 A:middle
So, let's try something a little

00:03:40.216 --> 00:03:42.906 A:middle
bit different, and what about

00:03:42.906 --> 00:03:44.166 A:middle
something to get to the core of

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:45.406 A:middle
what delicious might make us

00:03:45.406 --> 00:03:45.706 A:middle
feel.

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.086 A:middle
Something like a facial

00:03:49.086 --> 00:03:49.566 A:middle
expression.

00:03:50.156 --> 00:03:51.606 A:middle
It's cute and relatable,

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:55.046 A:middle
expressive, but we should be

00:03:55.046 --> 00:03:56.106 A:middle
mindful here that in some

00:03:56.106 --> 00:04:00.066 A:middle
cultures using like a face, a

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:01.926 A:middle
mouth, or a body part can be

00:04:01.926 --> 00:04:05.536 A:middle
seen as inappropriate; so, be

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:06.326 A:middle
mindful of that.

00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:09.006 A:middle
So, what is a universal symbol

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:09.756 A:middle
for delicious?

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:14.196 A:middle
What about a heart?

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:16.626 A:middle
We love cheeseburgers.

00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:17.456 A:middle
Some people like pizza.

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:19.356 A:middle
Some people love ice cream.

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:22.086 A:middle
The association of love with

00:04:22.086 --> 00:04:23.776 A:middle
delicious is much more universal

00:04:23.776 --> 00:04:24.646 A:middle
than our other options.

00:04:26.176 --> 00:04:27.176 A:middle
So, this is a nice effective

00:04:27.176 --> 00:04:27.636 A:middle
solution.

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:31.366 A:middle
Okay. So, let's take a look at

00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:33.236 A:middle
some examples of where we use

00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:37.686 A:middle
glyphs on our platforms, on the

00:04:37.686 --> 00:04:43.416 A:middle
Mac, in the menu bar, in tool

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:48.126 A:middle
bars, and in sidebars, and most

00:04:48.126 --> 00:04:50.966 A:middle
recently, in the touch bar.

00:04:52.116 --> 00:04:57.966 A:middle
On iOS, in tab bars, list views,

00:04:59.676 --> 00:05:01.066 A:middle
and home screen quick action

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:01.306 A:middle
menus.

00:05:01.876 --> 00:05:03.246 A:middle
So, you can see, glyphs are

00:05:03.246 --> 00:05:05.826 A:middle
everywhere, and also notice that

00:05:05.826 --> 00:05:07.166 A:middle
they rarely ever stand alone.

00:05:08.076 --> 00:05:09.746 A:middle
So, that's why we need to be

00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:10.656 A:middle
mindful of some design

00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:12.866 A:middle
considerations when, you know,

00:05:12.866 --> 00:05:14.266 A:middle
we're crafting a set of glyphs.

00:05:16.556 --> 00:05:18.646 A:middle
Our goal should be to make them

00:05:18.696 --> 00:05:20.646 A:middle
feel like a family, and a family

00:05:20.646 --> 00:05:21.536 A:middle
has a shared set of

00:05:21.536 --> 00:05:22.256 A:middle
characteristics.

00:05:23.726 --> 00:05:25.266 A:middle
So, we're going to look at

00:05:25.316 --> 00:05:30.106 A:middle
optical weight, lines, and

00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:30.566 A:middle
positioning.

00:05:34.586 --> 00:05:37.536 A:middle
In this example, the set feels a

00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:38.316 A:middle
bit right heavy.

00:05:39.346 --> 00:05:42.716 A:middle
The two glyphs on the left just

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.576 A:middle
are optically smaller, and

00:05:44.646 --> 00:05:46.166 A:middle
consequently they feel a bit

00:05:46.166 --> 00:05:46.806 A:middle
less significant.

00:05:46.806 --> 00:05:49.226 A:middle
So, if we turn on our guides, we

00:05:49.226 --> 00:05:50.526 A:middle
can see that we've constrained

00:05:50.526 --> 00:05:51.696 A:middle
ourselves to these vertical

00:05:51.696 --> 00:05:52.076 A:middle
bounds.

00:05:53.106 --> 00:05:54.926 A:middle
Let's turn those off and scale

00:05:54.926 --> 00:05:58.626 A:middle
the up optically, and that feels

00:05:58.626 --> 00:05:59.046 A:middle
much better.

00:06:00.556 --> 00:06:04.166 A:middle
Here's the before and the after.

00:06:05.606 --> 00:06:07.256 A:middle
Because the elliptical shape of

00:06:07.256 --> 00:06:09.366 A:middle
messages and the narrow shape of

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:12.136 A:middle
phone have less surface area, we

00:06:12.136 --> 00:06:13.766 A:middle
can use scale to achieve this

00:06:13.896 --> 00:06:14.656 A:middle
optical balance.

00:06:16.656 --> 00:06:18.056 A:middle
And let's notice another subtle

00:06:18.056 --> 00:06:19.516 A:middle
detail in the set here that

00:06:19.516 --> 00:06:20.506 A:middle
helps the family of these

00:06:20.506 --> 00:06:20.906 A:middle
glyphs.

00:06:22.096 --> 00:06:24.156 A:middle
Look at the gap in the video

00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:27.236 A:middle
camera and the negative space in

00:06:27.236 --> 00:06:27.756 A:middle
the envelope.

00:06:28.016 --> 00:06:29.126 A:middle
They share the same line weight.

00:06:29.126 --> 00:06:30.636 A:middle
So, let's look at lines next.

00:06:36.786 --> 00:06:38.026 A:middle
Here, it looks like the glyphs

00:06:38.026 --> 00:06:39.026 A:middle
might have been scaled from

00:06:39.026 --> 00:06:41.196 A:middle
various places to fit together

00:06:41.256 --> 00:06:41.966 A:middle
at the size.

00:06:42.966 --> 00:06:44.526 A:middle
But because they don't share a

00:06:44.526 --> 00:06:46.676 A:middle
consistent line weight, some

00:06:46.676 --> 00:06:48.186 A:middle
look more emphasized than

00:06:48.186 --> 00:06:49.006 A:middle
others, and this can be

00:06:49.006 --> 00:06:52.196 A:middle
confusing, and they just don't

00:06:52.196 --> 00:06:52.686 A:middle
family well.

00:06:54.356 --> 00:06:55.516 A:middle
So, when we normalize these,

00:06:56.446 --> 00:06:57.486 A:middle
we've created a much more

00:06:57.486 --> 00:06:58.256 A:middle
coherent set.

00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:05.456 A:middle
Here's the before and the after.

00:07:06.106 --> 00:07:07.516 A:middle
A subtle change like this can

00:07:07.516 --> 00:07:08.976 A:middle
really affect the integrity of

00:07:08.976 --> 00:07:09.276 A:middle
your app.

00:07:10.716 --> 00:07:11.646 A:middle
Let's move on to positioning.

00:07:13.206 --> 00:07:15.456 A:middle
And this is a great example here

00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:17.646 A:middle
of optical positioning, which

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:19.866 A:middle
can sometimes be overlooked, and

00:07:19.866 --> 00:07:21.126 A:middle
we can really see it when we

00:07:21.126 --> 00:07:23.536 A:middle
introduce this centered circle

00:07:23.536 --> 00:07:24.396 A:middle
around that Play glyph.

00:07:25.536 --> 00:07:27.726 A:middle
Notice, that art is perfectly

00:07:27.796 --> 00:07:29.946 A:middle
centered within that space, but

00:07:30.056 --> 00:07:31.516 A:middle
optically, it just, it just

00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:31.926 A:middle
looks off.

00:07:32.106 --> 00:07:34.226 A:middle
So, if we nudge that over a few

00:07:34.226 --> 00:07:37.896 A:middle
pixels to the right, we achieve

00:07:37.896 --> 00:07:39.046 A:middle
a much more balanced result.

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:43.086 A:middle
So, here's the before and the

00:07:43.336 --> 00:07:44.106 A:middle
after.

00:07:45.676 --> 00:07:47.316 A:middle
And optical positioning can

00:07:47.426 --> 00:07:49.326 A:middle
apply to almost any asset that's

00:07:49.326 --> 00:07:51.816 A:middle
asymmetrical or heavier on one

00:07:51.816 --> 00:07:52.576 A:middle
side than the other.

00:07:52.676 --> 00:07:55.816 A:middle
In this example, the share glyph

00:07:56.516 --> 00:07:57.916 A:middle
is, again, perfectly centered

00:07:57.916 --> 00:07:59.916 A:middle
within that space, but it just

00:07:59.916 --> 00:08:01.406 A:middle
looks like it's sitting a bit

00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:01.786 A:middle
too low.

00:08:03.276 --> 00:08:04.726 A:middle
So, by nudging it up a few

00:08:04.726 --> 00:08:06.156 A:middle
pixels, we achieve, again, a

00:08:06.156 --> 00:08:07.896 A:middle
much more considered result.

00:08:10.716 --> 00:08:11.896 A:middle
And by the way, you can bake

00:08:11.896 --> 00:08:12.916 A:middle
this padding right into the

00:08:12.916 --> 00:08:13.366 A:middle
asset.

00:08:14.376 --> 00:08:15.826 A:middle
So, when you go to integrate,

00:08:16.776 --> 00:08:17.906 A:middle
you just center that asset

00:08:17.966 --> 00:08:20.336 A:middle
perfectly in that space, and any

00:08:20.336 --> 00:08:22.466 A:middle
adjustments that are needed be

00:08:22.466 --> 00:08:23.576 A:middle
done with a simple [inaudible]

00:08:23.576 --> 00:08:24.056 A:middle
as well.

00:08:26.296 --> 00:08:27.316 A:middle
So, when you're crafting your

00:08:27.316 --> 00:08:31.116 A:middle
glyphs, build them as sets.

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:35.546 A:middle
Test them in context, and always

00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:36.876 A:middle
preview them on device, and this

00:08:36.876 --> 00:08:37.466 A:middle
will help you achieve these

00:08:37.466 --> 00:08:37.976 A:middle
results.

00:08:44.296 --> 00:08:45.116 A:middle
So, when you're creating

00:08:45.116 --> 00:08:46.056 A:middle
something from scratch, it can

00:08:46.056 --> 00:08:47.716 A:middle
often be hard to find a starting

00:08:47.786 --> 00:08:47.976 A:middle
point.

00:08:47.976 --> 00:08:49.056 A:middle
It could be overwhelming.

00:08:49.846 --> 00:08:52.156 A:middle
So, how do you get started?

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:53.136 A:middle
Let's look at a couple of

00:08:53.136 --> 00:08:54.266 A:middle
considerations that can help.

00:08:55.466 --> 00:08:57.096 A:middle
When designing for spaces inside

00:08:57.096 --> 00:08:59.076 A:middle
of your app, you know, such as

00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:01.346 A:middle
list views or buttons, consider

00:09:01.346 --> 00:09:02.876 A:middle
the relationship between type

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:03.926 A:middle
and the glyphs.

00:09:05.356 --> 00:09:06.666 A:middle
If you have a light type style,

00:09:07.106 --> 00:09:08.386 A:middle
consider matching your lines to

00:09:08.386 --> 00:09:09.196 A:middle
the weight of the type.

00:09:10.346 --> 00:09:11.616 A:middle
If you have a heavy type style,

00:09:11.616 --> 00:09:13.396 A:middle
or more weighted, or filled

00:09:13.396 --> 00:09:14.516 A:middle
glyph style, it might be more

00:09:14.516 --> 00:09:14.916 A:middle
appropriate.

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:19.196 A:middle
Here's an example from Airbnb.

00:09:19.196 --> 00:09:21.926 A:middle
Notice the lines of the glyphs

00:09:21.926 --> 00:09:23.106 A:middle
match the fonts nicely.

00:09:23.576 --> 00:09:24.376 A:middle
Looks like they really

00:09:24.376 --> 00:09:25.466 A:middle
considered that relationship

00:09:25.466 --> 00:09:26.696 A:middle
between type and glyphs, and it

00:09:26.696 --> 00:09:26.946 A:middle
looks nice.

00:09:31.366 --> 00:09:34.126 A:middle
Now, for system spaces, such as

00:09:34.566 --> 00:09:36.986 A:middle
the Touch Bar on the Mac or Home

00:09:36.986 --> 00:09:38.956 A:middle
screen quick action menus on

00:09:39.116 --> 00:09:41.256 A:middle
iOS, and the central resource

00:09:41.386 --> 00:09:42.916 A:middle
can be the existing system

00:09:43.636 --> 00:09:44.036 A:middle
assets.

00:09:46.616 --> 00:09:48.056 A:middle
In Airbnb's Home screen quick

00:09:48.056 --> 00:09:49.136 A:middle
action menu, we can see the

00:09:49.136 --> 00:09:51.296 A:middle
consistency between their custom

00:09:51.296 --> 00:09:53.916 A:middle
glyphs and the platforms shared

00:09:53.916 --> 00:09:54.136 A:middle
glyphs.

00:09:56.626 --> 00:09:57.956 A:middle
And notice, these glyphs are a

00:09:57.956 --> 00:09:59.466 A:middle
bit larger and heavier than

00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:00.546 A:middle
their in-app counterparts.

00:10:02.506 --> 00:10:03.846 A:middle
So, this is an excellent example

00:10:03.846 --> 00:10:05.586 A:middle
of craftsmanship here by Airbnb.

00:10:07.976 --> 00:10:10.316 A:middle
Now, we have templates on the

00:10:10.316 --> 00:10:11.916 A:middle
human interface guidelines to

00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:14.656 A:middle
help you match optical weight

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:15.766 A:middle
lines and positioning.

00:10:16.876 --> 00:10:19.106 A:middle
This will help you save time, be

00:10:19.346 --> 00:10:20.706 A:middle
harmonious with the established

00:10:20.706 --> 00:10:22.596 A:middle
design language, and you can

00:10:22.596 --> 00:10:23.986 A:middle
even output your assets directly

00:10:23.986 --> 00:10:24.746 A:middle
from these templates, which is

00:10:24.746 --> 00:10:24.976 A:middle
really nice.

00:10:28.756 --> 00:10:29.436 A:middle
All right.

00:10:29.436 --> 00:10:30.756 A:middle
So, we've gone over a bunch of

00:10:30.756 --> 00:10:32.126 A:middle
things here in a short period of

00:10:32.126 --> 00:10:32.346 A:middle
time.

00:10:32.346 --> 00:10:33.456 A:middle
Let's do a quick recap.

00:10:34.626 --> 00:10:35.986 A:middle
When conceptualizing a glyph,

00:10:36.966 --> 00:10:38.886 A:middle
simplify and think globally.

00:10:40.866 --> 00:10:42.946 A:middle
When crafting them, build them

00:10:43.126 --> 00:10:45.376 A:middle
as sets and test them in context

00:10:45.836 --> 00:10:47.026 A:middle
to make them feel like a family.

00:10:49.326 --> 00:10:52.346 A:middle
Consider the relationship of

00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:53.826 A:middle
type in your glyphs.

00:10:56.186 --> 00:10:58.966 A:middle
And finally, adapt your assets

00:10:59.416 --> 00:11:00.436 A:middle
for system spaces.

00:11:01.816 --> 00:11:03.266 A:middle
So, I hope that these tips will

00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:04.786 A:middle
help you build more effective

00:11:04.786 --> 00:11:06.496 A:middle
and delightful experiences.

00:11:07.276 --> 00:11:08.366 A:middle
But wait a minute, something

00:11:08.366 --> 00:11:09.046 A:middle
looks wrong here.

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:10.926 A:middle
That's much better.

00:11:10.926 --> 00:11:11.976 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:11:12.516 --> 00:11:21.150 A:middle
