WEBVTT

00:02:06.796 --> 00:02:07.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:02:08.116 --> 00:02:09.476 A:middle
My name is Gregory Hughes and

00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:10.796 A:middle
I'm really excited to have the

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:12.116 A:middle
opportunity to speak to you

00:02:12.116 --> 00:02:14.246 A:middle
today about a super important

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:15.256 A:middle
and interesting topic.

00:02:15.456 --> 00:02:17.206 A:middle
The accessibility of media and

00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:17.786 A:middle
games.

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:21.466 A:middle
At Apple, we strive to surprise

00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:23.246 A:middle
and delight all of our customers

00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:24.816 A:middle
regardless of their abilities

00:02:24.816 --> 00:02:25.886 A:middle
and disabilities.

00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:29.556 A:middle
We envision a world where users

00:02:29.556 --> 00:02:31.026 A:middle
like Patrick are able to do what

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.846 A:middle
they love and love what they do,

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:34.346 A:middle
without being hindered by

00:02:34.346 --> 00:02:35.116 A:middle
technology.

00:02:35.896 --> 00:02:37.096 A:middle
We want to make sure that users

00:02:37.096 --> 00:02:38.376 A:middle
with disabilities can experience

00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:40.326 A:middle
the same surprise, delight,

00:02:40.836 --> 00:02:42.496 A:middle
magic moments and most

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:44.346 A:middle
importantly fun when using our

00:02:44.346 --> 00:02:45.116 A:middle
devices.

00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:47.796 A:middle
As part of that vision, your

00:02:47.796 --> 00:02:49.086 A:middle
apps play a key role.

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:51.066 A:middle
You play such an important part

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:52.786 A:middle
in helping us to deliver an

00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:54.796 A:middle
inclusive, accessible and fun

00:02:54.796 --> 00:02:56.656 A:middle
platform for all of our users.

00:02:58.186 --> 00:02:59.456 A:middle
During our conversations today,

00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:00.626 A:middle
we're going to be talking about

00:03:01.096 --> 00:03:02.936 A:middle
four categories of disabilities.

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:04.616 A:middle
Visual disabilities, which are

00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:06.206 A:middle
those pertaining to sight.

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:08.256 A:middle
How much a user can see, in some

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:10.166 A:middle
cases, the users that can't see.

00:03:11.806 --> 00:03:13.126 A:middle
Motor disabilities, which are

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.296 A:middle
disabilities pertaining to how a

00:03:14.296 --> 00:03:15.606 A:middle
user interacts physically with

00:03:15.606 --> 00:03:17.046 A:middle
the device, whether they can

00:03:17.046 --> 00:03:18.616 A:middle
hold the device at all, how to

00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:20.056 A:middle
use a keyboard or mouse.

00:03:21.466 --> 00:03:23.096 A:middle
Hearing disabilities, which are

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:24.546 A:middle
those pertaining to how much

00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:26.186 A:middle
somebody can hear and in some

00:03:26.186 --> 00:03:27.856 A:middle
cases the complete inability to

00:03:27.856 --> 00:03:28.216 A:middle
hear.

00:03:29.316 --> 00:03:31.036 A:middle
And lastly, disabilities related

00:03:31.036 --> 00:03:31.786 A:middle
to cognition.

00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:33.736 A:middle
And these are displays that

00:03:33.736 --> 00:03:35.246 A:middle
affect how somebody thinks when

00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:36.006 A:middle
using your game.

00:03:36.356 --> 00:03:37.906 A:middle
How much they can remember from

00:03:37.906 --> 00:03:38.966 A:middle
the original instructions you

00:03:38.966 --> 00:03:39.496 A:middle
gave them.

00:03:39.846 --> 00:03:42.016 A:middle
Or what type of UI works best

00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:42.446 A:middle
for them.

00:03:43.286 --> 00:03:44.496 A:middle
So, while talking about these

00:03:44.496 --> 00:03:45.826 A:middle
disabilities, today we're going

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:46.856 A:middle
to break everything down into

00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:48.096 A:middle
three key sections.

00:03:48.146 --> 00:03:50.386 A:middle
First, I'm going to present how

00:03:50.686 --> 00:03:53.106 A:middle
to make your media and videos

00:03:53.106 --> 00:03:54.116 A:middle
more accessible in your

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:54.976 A:middle
applications.

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:57.236 A:middle
We'll then build on some of

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:59.696 A:middle
those topics and talk about how

00:03:59.696 --> 00:04:00.946 A:middle
to make your games more

00:04:00.946 --> 00:04:01.436 A:middle
accessible.

00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:02.746 A:middle
How do you think about

00:04:02.746 --> 00:04:04.176 A:middle
accessible design in gaming.

00:04:04.566 --> 00:04:05.676 A:middle
And this is really interesting.

00:04:05.676 --> 00:04:07.316 A:middle
As we talk about this, it's

00:04:07.316 --> 00:04:09.336 A:middle
really easy to sit back and say,

00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:10.676 A:middle
"My game can't be made

00:04:10.676 --> 00:04:11.316 A:middle
accessible."

00:04:12.146 --> 00:04:13.266 A:middle
And one thought experiment that

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:15.866 A:middle
we often go through is let's

00:04:15.866 --> 00:04:16.936 A:middle
start from a point where we

00:04:16.936 --> 00:04:18.266 A:middle
think it can be done.

00:04:18.686 --> 00:04:20.366 A:middle
Let's assume that somebody

00:04:20.366 --> 00:04:22.166 A:middle
that's blind can use my video

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:23.956 A:middle
editing app, or somebody with

00:04:23.956 --> 00:04:25.386 A:middle
cerebral palsy can play my

00:04:25.386 --> 00:04:26.606 A:middle
first-person shooter game.

00:04:27.336 --> 00:04:28.636 A:middle
The challenge and the fun part

00:04:28.636 --> 00:04:29.916 A:middle
is then figuring out how that

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:30.506 A:middle
can be done.

00:04:31.286 --> 00:04:33.246 A:middle
And so, try to keep that in mind

00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:34.256 A:middle
as we're going through some of

00:04:34.256 --> 00:04:36.086 A:middle
these specific cases and general

00:04:36.086 --> 00:04:37.976 A:middle
cases for adding accessibility

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:38.866 A:middle
to your games.

00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:41.086 A:middle
And then last, we're going to

00:04:41.086 --> 00:04:42.366 A:middle
show a demo game that we made,

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:44.266 A:middle
that highlights some of these

00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:46.156 A:middle
accessible design concepts.

00:04:46.496 --> 00:04:48.086 A:middle
And we'll give you some ideas on

00:04:48.086 --> 00:04:49.556 A:middle
how you can implement them in

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:51.646 A:middle
your own app.

00:04:52.086 --> 00:04:53.876 A:middle
So, first, the accessibility of

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:54.796 A:middle
media and video.

00:04:55.306 --> 00:04:56.676 A:middle
And generally, the most

00:04:56.676 --> 00:04:57.756 A:middle
straightforward one that people

00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:59.216 A:middle
think about is the accessibility

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:00.016 A:middle
of images.

00:05:00.376 --> 00:05:01.376 A:middle
And anyone that's worked in

00:05:01.376 --> 00:05:03.426 A:middle
accessible design will always

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:05.476 A:middle
say, always add alt text.

00:05:06.096 --> 00:05:07.426 A:middle
But it's not quite that simple

00:05:07.426 --> 00:05:08.226 A:middle
in all cases.

00:05:08.926 --> 00:05:10.066 A:middle
For example, if we take a look

00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:11.356 A:middle
at this image on the screen.

00:05:12.456 --> 00:05:14.046 A:middle
You might describe this as

00:05:14.436 --> 00:05:15.716 A:middle
"Woman sitting in a hammock

00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:16.866 A:middle
playing a guitar."

00:05:18.246 --> 00:05:19.596 A:middle
An equally good description

00:05:19.596 --> 00:05:22.306 A:middle
might be "Person playing guitar

00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:23.836 A:middle
with custom artwork drawn using

00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:24.376 A:middle
a marker."

00:05:25.226 --> 00:05:26.786 A:middle
Equally, you could describe this

00:05:26.786 --> 00:05:29.026 A:middle
as "Image demonstrating the use

00:05:29.026 --> 00:05:31.086 A:middle
of the camera's aperture to make

00:05:31.086 --> 00:05:32.066 A:middle
the foreground blurry while

00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:33.656 A:middle
keeping the subject in focus."

00:05:34.236 --> 00:05:35.446 A:middle
So, the important part when

00:05:35.446 --> 00:05:36.866 A:middle
trying to describe your images,

00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:37.996 A:middle
trying to populate that alt

00:05:37.996 --> 00:05:39.836 A:middle
text, is thinking about how this

00:05:39.836 --> 00:05:40.776 A:middle
image is used in your

00:05:40.776 --> 00:05:41.336 A:middle
application.

00:05:41.696 --> 00:05:43.166 A:middle
What's the context for the image

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:44.276 A:middle
and what's it conveying to the

00:05:44.276 --> 00:05:44.746 A:middle
user?

00:05:45.856 --> 00:05:47.096 A:middle
Once you can think about that,

00:05:47.256 --> 00:05:48.326 A:middle
you can then create a really

00:05:48.326 --> 00:05:49.776 A:middle
good, clear and concise

00:05:49.776 --> 00:05:51.226 A:middle
description for users that might

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.546 A:middle
not be able to see the image.

00:05:53.076 --> 00:05:55.206 A:middle
So, for images we always want

00:05:55.206 --> 00:05:56.896 A:middle
developers to think about clear,

00:05:56.896 --> 00:05:59.096 A:middle
concise descriptions that convey

00:05:59.096 --> 00:06:00.066 A:middle
the same information that

00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:01.336 A:middle
somebody, that a sighted user

00:06:01.336 --> 00:06:02.726 A:middle
market get.

00:06:03.876 --> 00:06:06.706 A:middle
For audio, we're generally

00:06:06.736 --> 00:06:07.866 A:middle
thinking about disabilities

00:06:07.896 --> 00:06:08.876 A:middle
pertaining to hearing.

00:06:09.256 --> 00:06:10.286 A:middle
How does somebody that can't

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:12.676 A:middle
hear, or has difficulty hearing

00:06:12.676 --> 00:06:13.816 A:middle
perceive the audio in your

00:06:13.816 --> 00:06:14.476 A:middle
application?

00:06:15.046 --> 00:06:17.846 A:middle
For audio, there are generally

00:06:17.846 --> 00:06:19.396 A:middle
two categories of audio that we

00:06:19.396 --> 00:06:20.666 A:middle
see in apps.

00:06:21.036 --> 00:06:22.366 A:middle
The first is spoken audio.

00:06:22.666 --> 00:06:24.256 A:middle
And this could be something like

00:06:24.506 --> 00:06:26.596 A:middle
a recording of the "I Have a

00:06:26.596 --> 00:06:27.446 A:middle
Dream" speech.

00:06:27.986 --> 00:06:30.066 A:middle
Or it could be a podcast that

00:06:30.066 --> 00:06:31.246 A:middle
you play back in your app.

00:06:31.696 --> 00:06:32.976 A:middle
But regardless, when dealing

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.196 A:middle
with spoken audio you want to

00:06:34.196 --> 00:06:35.746 A:middle
think about in the context of

00:06:35.746 --> 00:06:37.356 A:middle
your application how can you

00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:38.646 A:middle
provide somebody that can't hear

00:06:38.646 --> 00:06:40.486 A:middle
that spoken audio access to the

00:06:40.486 --> 00:06:41.426 A:middle
same information.

00:06:42.046 --> 00:06:43.456 A:middle
So, this is generally some way

00:06:43.456 --> 00:06:44.776 A:middle
of providing a transcript.

00:06:45.186 --> 00:06:46.876 A:middle
This could be a popup that shows

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:47.706 A:middle
up in your app to show a

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:48.336 A:middle
transcript.

00:06:48.626 --> 00:06:49.686 A:middle
In the case of many great

00:06:49.686 --> 00:06:51.086 A:middle
podcasts, they have online

00:06:51.086 --> 00:06:52.416 A:middle
transcripts that somebody who's

00:06:52.446 --> 00:06:54.046 A:middle
deaf could go and read to get

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:55.826 A:middle
the same contextual information

00:06:56.186 --> 00:06:57.376 A:middle
that is conveyed in the podcase.

00:06:58.176 --> 00:06:59.906 A:middle
So, it really how and why you're

00:06:59.906 --> 00:07:01.256 A:middle
using this spoken information

00:07:01.306 --> 00:07:02.936 A:middle
for how you're going to adapt it

00:07:02.936 --> 00:07:04.366 A:middle
to somebody that can't access it

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:05.176 A:middle
through hearing.

00:07:06.356 --> 00:07:07.826 A:middle
The next way that audio is used

00:07:07.826 --> 00:07:10.166 A:middle
in apps are for sound effects or

00:07:10.436 --> 00:07:11.956 A:middle
ways to convey information.

00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:15.116 A:middle
So, for example, in a game, you

00:07:15.116 --> 00:07:16.956 A:middle
might convey where an enemy is

00:07:16.996 --> 00:07:18.616 A:middle
by audio on the left side or the

00:07:18.616 --> 00:07:19.526 A:middle
right side of the user.

00:07:20.386 --> 00:07:21.776 A:middle
And in these cases, you want to

00:07:21.776 --> 00:07:23.226 A:middle
think about how can you provide

00:07:23.226 --> 00:07:25.066 A:middle
that same information either

00:07:25.306 --> 00:07:26.556 A:middle
through visual or haptic

00:07:26.636 --> 00:07:27.626 A:middle
feedback to the user.

00:07:28.266 --> 00:07:29.836 A:middle
So, again it's thinking about if

00:07:29.836 --> 00:07:31.316 A:middle
somebody can't hear this audio,

00:07:31.586 --> 00:07:32.406 A:middle
which is really easy to

00:07:32.406 --> 00:07:33.626 A:middle
simulate, you can just mute your

00:07:33.626 --> 00:07:35.566 A:middle
device, how can we convey the

00:07:35.566 --> 00:07:37.106 A:middle
same information in our game or

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:39.526 A:middle
application to such a user.

00:07:42.216 --> 00:07:43.776 A:middle
So, for audio, we are always

00:07:43.776 --> 00:07:44.936 A:middle
thinking about how to convey the

00:07:44.936 --> 00:07:46.596 A:middle
same information, what is an

00:07:46.596 --> 00:07:47.886 A:middle
alternative way of conveying

00:07:47.886 --> 00:07:48.116 A:middle
that.

00:07:50.256 --> 00:07:51.946 A:middle
The last part of media and video

00:07:52.246 --> 00:07:53.826 A:middle
is thinking about video, which

00:07:53.826 --> 00:07:56.936 A:middle
is kind of the combination of

00:07:56.936 --> 00:07:58.196 A:middle
images and audio.

00:07:59.516 --> 00:08:00.616 A:middle
So, if you're not familiar,

00:08:00.616 --> 00:08:02.316 A:middle
video has three key tracks,

00:08:02.496 --> 00:08:04.546 A:middle
sometimes called media groups.

00:08:05.106 --> 00:08:06.716 A:middle
The first is a visual track.

00:08:06.816 --> 00:08:08.046 A:middle
This is kind of the moving

00:08:08.046 --> 00:08:09.156 A:middle
pictures that we see.

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:11.956 A:middle
The next is the audible track.

00:08:12.026 --> 00:08:13.146 A:middle
This is the track that contains

00:08:13.146 --> 00:08:14.016 A:middle
all the sound, the sound

00:08:14.016 --> 00:08:15.486 A:middle
effects, the spoken dialogue.

00:08:16.876 --> 00:08:18.756 A:middle
And last is what's called the

00:08:18.756 --> 00:08:19.736 A:middle
legible track.

00:08:20.036 --> 00:08:21.036 A:middle
And this one most people are

00:08:21.036 --> 00:08:21.656 A:middle
familiar with.

00:08:21.726 --> 00:08:23.506 A:middle
I know most people are familiar

00:08:23.506 --> 00:08:25.146 A:middle
with it because we intro'd this

00:08:25.146 --> 00:08:27.056 A:middle
with a closed-captioned video.

00:08:27.056 --> 00:08:28.506 A:middle
But you've probably also seen

00:08:28.506 --> 00:08:29.946 A:middle
closed captions in the gym or

00:08:29.946 --> 00:08:30.636 A:middle
the airport.

00:08:30.996 --> 00:08:32.796 A:middle
And legible tracks can be more

00:08:32.796 --> 00:08:33.966 A:middle
than just closed captions.

00:08:34.276 --> 00:08:35.556 A:middle
They can also be subtitles for

00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:36.726 A:middle
users that don't understand the

00:08:36.726 --> 00:08:37.256 A:middle
language.

00:08:37.706 --> 00:08:39.516 A:middle
They could also be closed

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:42.186 A:middle
captions as I said, but another

00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:44.146 A:middle
term for closed captions is SDH,

00:08:44.146 --> 00:08:45.436 A:middle
or subtitles for the deaf and

00:08:45.436 --> 00:08:46.126 A:middle
hard of hearing.

00:08:46.906 --> 00:08:48.856 A:middle
Subtitles for the deaf and hard

00:08:48.856 --> 00:08:50.106 A:middle
of hearing are different than

00:08:50.106 --> 00:08:51.636 A:middle
normal subtitles and subtitles

00:08:51.636 --> 00:08:52.406 A:middle
for translation.

00:08:53.126 --> 00:08:54.286 A:middle
Subtitles for the deaf and hard

00:08:54.286 --> 00:08:56.086 A:middle
of hearing can include lots more

00:08:56.086 --> 00:08:57.446 A:middle
information about the content.

00:08:57.446 --> 00:08:58.826 A:middle
So, they might include things

00:08:58.826 --> 00:09:00.336 A:middle
like what song is playing.

00:09:00.676 --> 00:09:02.416 A:middle
Was there a loud crash in the

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:04.156 A:middle
other room, or in some cases,

00:09:04.156 --> 00:09:05.456 A:middle
even the absence of sound.

00:09:05.456 --> 00:09:07.376 A:middle
So, it will just say silence if

00:09:07.376 --> 00:09:08.196 A:middle
that's important to

00:09:08.196 --> 00:09:09.336 A:middle
understanding what's happening.

00:09:09.536 --> 00:09:10.916 A:middle
So, again it's taking a step

00:09:10.916 --> 00:09:12.476 A:middle
back and thinking about if I

00:09:12.476 --> 00:09:13.746 A:middle
didn't have the ability to hear

00:09:13.746 --> 00:09:15.586 A:middle
this video, what information

00:09:15.586 --> 00:09:17.496 A:middle
needs to be conveyed to such a

00:09:17.496 --> 00:09:17.886 A:middle
user.

00:09:18.286 --> 00:09:19.766 A:middle
And so, for the most part, this

00:09:19.766 --> 00:09:21.056 A:middle
is, you're playing back videos,

00:09:21.056 --> 00:09:22.146 A:middle
it's working with your content

00:09:22.146 --> 00:09:23.706 A:middle
providers and making sure

00:09:23.706 --> 00:09:25.286 A:middle
they're aware that you want a

00:09:25.286 --> 00:09:26.686 A:middle
closed-captioned track created.

00:09:26.686 --> 00:09:28.666 A:middle
And in some cases, a subtitle

00:09:28.666 --> 00:09:28.946 A:middle
track.

00:09:29.376 --> 00:09:30.436 A:middle
But it's always thinking about

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:31.646 A:middle
closed captions and thinking

00:09:31.646 --> 00:09:33.096 A:middle
about users with hearing

00:09:33.096 --> 00:09:34.216 A:middle
impairments and providing

00:09:34.216 --> 00:09:34.906 A:middle
information.

00:09:36.036 --> 00:09:37.326 A:middle
Playing this back is really

00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:38.386 A:middle
simple in your apps.

00:09:38.686 --> 00:09:41.386 A:middle
If you're using AVKit, on iOS or

00:09:41.386 --> 00:09:42.916 A:middle
macOS, you don't have to do

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:43.386 A:middle
anything.

00:09:43.386 --> 00:09:44.616 A:middle
As long as your content creator

00:09:44.616 --> 00:09:45.906 A:middle
put the track in the video, it

00:09:45.906 --> 00:09:47.206 A:middle
will playback appropriately,

00:09:47.246 --> 00:09:48.656 A:middle
based on the user's settings.

00:09:49.726 --> 00:09:51.316 A:middle
If you're working a little bit

00:09:51.316 --> 00:09:53.456 A:middle
lower level at AVFoundation, you

00:09:53.456 --> 00:09:54.526 A:middle
will need to do a little bit of

00:09:54.526 --> 00:09:56.296 A:middle
work to let a user select which

00:09:56.426 --> 00:09:57.716 A:middle
captioning track they want to

00:09:57.716 --> 00:09:58.116 A:middle
see.

00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:01.946 A:middle
So, if you're the lower level as

00:10:01.946 --> 00:10:03.136 A:middle
I said at the AVFoundation

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:05.406 A:middle
level, you will need to first

00:10:05.406 --> 00:10:07.996 A:middle
get all of the media group for

00:10:07.996 --> 00:10:09.216 A:middle
the legible tracks again, we

00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:11.026 A:middle
said closed captioned subtitles

00:10:11.026 --> 00:10:12.286 A:middle
are the legible tracks.

00:10:13.666 --> 00:10:14.606 A:middle
You'll then need to do a little

00:10:14.606 --> 00:10:15.626 A:middle
bit of pruning, because this can

00:10:15.626 --> 00:10:16.816 A:middle
be a really big list.

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:18.686 A:middle
And you want to exclude forced

00:10:18.686 --> 00:10:20.286 A:middle
subtitles and auxiliary

00:10:20.806 --> 00:10:22.566 A:middle
subtitles from that list.

00:10:24.036 --> 00:10:25.186 A:middle
Then you' have a final list of

00:10:25.186 --> 00:10:26.376 A:middle
all of the tracks that should be

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:27.746 A:middle
displayed to a user and you'll

00:10:27.746 --> 00:10:29.176 A:middle
iterate over them and just add

00:10:29.176 --> 00:10:30.826 A:middle
them to some kind of menuing, or

00:10:30.826 --> 00:10:31.916 A:middle
some kind of other UI that

00:10:31.916 --> 00:10:33.066 A:middle
you're displaying to a user.

00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:37.026 A:middle
If you're working even lower

00:10:37.026 --> 00:10:38.696 A:middle
level than AVFoundation, if

00:10:38.696 --> 00:10:40.196 A:middle
you're taking responsibility for

00:10:40.196 --> 00:10:41.236 A:middle
drawing your own video,

00:10:41.236 --> 00:10:42.726 A:middle
rendering each frame, playing

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:44.546 A:middle
back your audio, you'll also

00:10:44.546 --> 00:10:45.576 A:middle
then be responsible for

00:10:45.616 --> 00:10:48.386 A:middle
rendering captioning content.

00:10:48.526 --> 00:10:50.026 A:middle
And depending on what content

00:10:50.026 --> 00:10:51.336 A:middle
you're playing, there can also

00:10:51.556 --> 00:10:53.686 A:middle
be legal regulations that you

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:55.656 A:middle
have to honor, system settings

00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:57.906 A:middle
for the user has for how they

00:10:57.906 --> 00:10:59.096 A:middle
want closed captions to be

00:10:59.096 --> 00:10:59.636 A:middle
displayed.

00:11:00.446 --> 00:11:01.736 A:middle
In order to do this, we have a

00:11:01.736 --> 00:11:02.976 A:middle
great framework called Media

00:11:02.976 --> 00:11:03.686 A:middle
Accessibility.

00:11:04.126 --> 00:11:05.486 A:middle
And this allows you to get all

00:11:05.486 --> 00:11:07.086 A:middle
of those user options for things

00:11:07.086 --> 00:11:08.326 A:middle
like foreground color,

00:11:08.326 --> 00:11:10.086 A:middle
background color, font size,

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:12.936 A:middle
font choice and other things

00:11:12.936 --> 00:11:13.856 A:middle
along those lines.

00:11:14.086 --> 00:11:15.336 A:middle
So, that you can render captions

00:11:15.336 --> 00:11:16.266 A:middle
the way they look everywhere

00:11:16.266 --> 00:11:17.076 A:middle
else in the system.

00:11:17.636 --> 00:11:18.986 A:middle
That's where most people stop,

00:11:19.296 --> 00:11:19.576 A:middle
right?

00:11:19.746 --> 00:11:21.226 A:middle
Most people are aware of closed

00:11:21.226 --> 00:11:22.276 A:middle
captions, they work with their

00:11:22.276 --> 00:11:23.116 A:middle
content creators.

00:11:23.436 --> 00:11:24.546 A:middle
Make sure they add a captioning

00:11:24.546 --> 00:11:24.936 A:middle
track.

00:11:25.816 --> 00:11:28.906 A:middle
And it's easy to overlook the

00:11:28.966 --> 00:11:29.966 A:middle
audible track.

00:11:30.446 --> 00:11:32.616 A:middle
It's easy to say, for somebody

00:11:32.616 --> 00:11:34.156 A:middle
that can't see, there's already

00:11:34.156 --> 00:11:35.356 A:middle
audio there, we don't need to do

00:11:35.356 --> 00:11:36.076 A:middle
anything else.

00:11:36.406 --> 00:11:37.676 A:middle
But if you think about watching

00:11:37.676 --> 00:11:40.056 A:middle
your favorite movie, or a TV

00:11:40.056 --> 00:11:41.286 A:middle
show that you watch regularly.

00:11:41.776 --> 00:11:42.706 A:middle
If you couldn't see what's

00:11:42.966 --> 00:11:44.536 A:middle
happening, yes, there's audio

00:11:44.536 --> 00:11:45.866 A:middle
but in a lot of cases it doesn't

00:11:45.866 --> 00:11:46.786 A:middle
convey everything that's

00:11:46.786 --> 00:11:47.286 A:middle
happening.

00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:49.826 A:middle
So, there's a technology to

00:11:49.826 --> 00:11:51.106 A:middle
solve that and it's called Audio

00:11:51.106 --> 00:11:51.886 A:middle
Descriptions.

00:11:52.406 --> 00:11:53.766 A:middle
And this is a secondary audio

00:11:53.766 --> 00:11:55.936 A:middle
track the user can select that

00:11:55.936 --> 00:11:57.806 A:middle
contains not only all the normal

00:11:57.886 --> 00:11:59.886 A:middle
narration, not only all the

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:01.616 A:middle
normal speech and sound effects,

00:12:01.856 --> 00:12:03.196 A:middle
but also narration for what's

00:12:03.196 --> 00:12:03.696 A:middle
happening.

00:12:04.546 --> 00:12:05.956 A:middle
Now most people have never

00:12:05.956 --> 00:12:06.636 A:middle
experienced this.

00:12:06.636 --> 00:12:07.956 A:middle
So, I want to play a short clip

00:12:07.956 --> 00:12:09.606 A:middle
of that intro video, that

00:12:09.606 --> 00:12:11.226 A:middle
includes the audio description

00:12:11.226 --> 00:12:11.636 A:middle
track.

00:12:14.516 --> 00:12:16.816 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

00:12:17.316 --> 00:12:19.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I have so much that I've

00:12:19.056 --> 00:12:21.246 A:middle
always wanted to express.

00:12:21.516 --> 00:12:24.076 A:middle
I'm like a volcano.

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:26.656 A:middle
I'm like Pelee or Mount Etna.

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:29.416 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Arm the track for recording.

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:30.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; I'm about ready to erupt.

00:12:31.086 --> 00:12:33.026 A:middle
&gt;&gt; He dances to a logic session

00:12:33.026 --> 00:12:33.906 A:middle
as titles appear.

00:12:34.016 --> 00:12:35.786 A:middle
Designed for Patrick L.

00:12:36.186 --> 00:12:37.026 A:middle
Designed for everyone.

00:12:37.746 --> 00:12:39.966 A:middle
An Apple logo appears.

00:12:43.716 --> 00:12:45.386 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, as you can see, this

00:12:45.386 --> 00:12:46.566 A:middle
audio description track is

00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:48.276 A:middle
really important for somebody

00:12:48.276 --> 00:12:49.436 A:middle
that can't see the content.

00:12:49.756 --> 00:12:51.846 A:middle
And maybe not critical in this

00:12:51.886 --> 00:12:53.376 A:middle
short video clip, but it can be

00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:54.356 A:middle
really important when you're

00:12:54.356 --> 00:12:55.756 A:middle
watching a movie or a TV show to

00:12:55.756 --> 00:12:56.796 A:middle
understand what's happening.

00:12:56.796 --> 00:12:58.486 A:middle
And it's mixed correctly with

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.516 A:middle
all of the other audio in the

00:13:00.516 --> 00:13:00.896 A:middle
video.

00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:02.586 A:middle
So, again the key part here just

00:13:02.586 --> 00:13:03.926 A:middle
like captions is working with

00:13:03.926 --> 00:13:05.256 A:middle
your content creators to make

00:13:05.256 --> 00:13:07.096 A:middle
sure, where appropriate these

00:13:07.096 --> 00:13:08.516 A:middle
audio description tracks are

00:13:08.516 --> 00:13:09.816 A:middle
created and rendered with the

00:13:09.816 --> 00:13:10.256 A:middle
video.

00:13:11.046 --> 00:13:12.276 A:middle
Playing them back, just like

00:13:12.276 --> 00:13:13.806 A:middle
captions you will get for free,

00:13:13.806 --> 00:13:15.296 A:middle
as long as you're using AVKit.

00:13:16.126 --> 00:13:17.846 A:middle
Again, just like captions if

00:13:17.846 --> 00:13:19.286 A:middle
you're working lower level than

00:13:19.286 --> 00:13:20.926 A:middle
AVKit, at the AVFoundation

00:13:20.926 --> 00:13:22.386 A:middle
level, you'll need to do a

00:13:22.386 --> 00:13:23.656 A:middle
little bit of work, and almost

00:13:23.656 --> 00:13:24.346 A:middle
the same work.

00:13:24.466 --> 00:13:25.816 A:middle
First you'll need to get the

00:13:25.816 --> 00:13:27.676 A:middle
media group for the audible

00:13:27.676 --> 00:13:28.416 A:middle
tracks.

00:13:29.126 --> 00:13:30.656 A:middle
Instead of pruning this time,

00:13:30.986 --> 00:13:32.046 A:middle
we're going to look for just the

00:13:32.046 --> 00:13:32.436 A:middle
track.

00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:33.846 A:middle
We're still pruning but instead

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:35.226 A:middle
of excluding tracks this time,

00:13:35.486 --> 00:13:36.316 A:middle
we're going to get just the

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.916 A:middle
primary audio tracks.

00:13:39.086 --> 00:13:40.256 A:middle
And we'll then iterate over

00:13:40.256 --> 00:13:43.276 A:middle
those to add them to a menu or

00:13:43.276 --> 00:13:45.346 A:middle
some other UI where the user can

00:13:45.796 --> 00:13:47.236 A:middle
select them.

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:49.196 A:middle
So, for video we now have a

00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:50.036 A:middle
complete story.

00:13:50.126 --> 00:13:51.216 A:middle
We've thought about users who

00:13:51.216 --> 00:13:53.026 A:middle
are blind, users who are deaf

00:13:53.076 --> 00:13:54.196 A:middle
and how they interact with our

00:13:54.196 --> 00:13:54.846 A:middle
content.

00:13:55.676 --> 00:13:58.036 A:middle
And how they consume our videos.

00:13:58.626 --> 00:14:02.586 A:middle
So, we talked about images, make

00:14:02.586 --> 00:14:04.226 A:middle
sure you add a clear and concise

00:14:04.286 --> 00:14:05.656 A:middle
description to your images.

00:14:06.336 --> 00:14:09.466 A:middle
Audio, make sure that you're

00:14:09.466 --> 00:14:10.906 A:middle
adding an alternative way for

00:14:10.906 --> 00:14:12.106 A:middle
users to access the audio.

00:14:12.566 --> 00:14:13.806 A:middle
And video, make sure you're

00:14:13.806 --> 00:14:14.826 A:middle
working with your content

00:14:14.866 --> 00:14:15.936 A:middle
creators to create

00:14:15.936 --> 00:14:17.366 A:middle
closed-captioned tracks, audio

00:14:17.366 --> 00:14:18.926 A:middle
description tracks and that

00:14:18.926 --> 00:14:19.956 A:middle
application will support the

00:14:19.956 --> 00:14:21.336 A:middle
playback of these correctly.

00:14:22.566 --> 00:14:23.726 A:middle
Now, I'd like to hand it over to

00:14:23.726 --> 00:14:25.206 A:middle
my colleague Charlotte, who's

00:14:25.206 --> 00:14:26.236 A:middle
going to build on some of these

00:14:26.236 --> 00:14:27.916 A:middle
concepts and talk about how they

00:14:27.916 --> 00:14:29.276 A:middle
can be applied to games and how

00:14:29.276 --> 00:14:30.386 A:middle
you can make some extraordinary

00:14:30.386 --> 00:14:31.946 A:middle
games that are accessible to

00:14:31.946 --> 00:14:33.086 A:middle
users with disabilities.

00:14:33.396 --> 00:14:33.866 A:middle
Thanks.

00:14:34.156 --> 00:14:36.156 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:14:36.296 --> 00:14:38.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:14:39.316 --> 00:14:41.416 A:middle
Thanks. I'm Charlotte Hill and

00:14:41.416 --> 00:14:42.666 A:middle
today I'm going to talk to you

00:14:42.666 --> 00:14:44.186 A:middle
about accessible games.

00:14:44.686 --> 00:14:47.206 A:middle
When you create a game, you want

00:14:47.206 --> 00:14:48.246 A:middle
to make something that your

00:14:48.246 --> 00:14:49.696 A:middle
users will get lost in.

00:14:50.116 --> 00:14:50.926 A:middle
You don't want them to get

00:14:50.966 --> 00:14:52.266 A:middle
pulled out of that experience

00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:53.296 A:middle
because of difficulties

00:14:53.296 --> 00:14:54.536 A:middle
interacting with your software.

00:14:55.316 --> 00:14:56.236 A:middle
Today I'm going to talk to you

00:14:56.236 --> 00:14:57.966 A:middle
about accessible games and how

00:14:57.966 --> 00:14:59.026 A:middle
to make a game that's fun to

00:14:59.026 --> 00:14:59.896 A:middle
play for everyone.

00:14:59.896 --> 00:15:03.146 A:middle
Earlier, we saw a video of

00:15:03.146 --> 00:15:04.536 A:middle
Patrick and how he uses

00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:06.176 A:middle
VoiceOver on his iPhone and his

00:15:06.176 --> 00:15:06.376 A:middle
Mac.

00:15:07.266 --> 00:15:08.826 A:middle
VoiceOver users like Patrick do

00:15:08.826 --> 00:15:09.796 A:middle
a lot of things with their

00:15:09.796 --> 00:15:11.626 A:middle
phones, including playing games.

00:15:12.266 --> 00:15:13.216 A:middle
When you're developing your

00:15:13.216 --> 00:15:15.036 A:middle
game, think about VoiceOver

00:15:15.036 --> 00:15:16.366 A:middle
users like Patrick with

00:15:16.366 --> 00:15:17.546 A:middle
different abilities and

00:15:17.546 --> 00:15:19.036 A:middle
disabilities and how they'll be

00:15:19.036 --> 00:15:20.386 A:middle
able to interact with your game.

00:15:20.846 --> 00:15:23.646 A:middle
Let's say I'm designing an app

00:15:23.706 --> 00:15:25.106 A:middle
based on the Four in a Row game.

00:15:25.796 --> 00:15:27.536 A:middle
This is a two-player game, where

00:15:27.536 --> 00:15:29.166 A:middle
each player takes turns dropping

00:15:29.166 --> 00:15:31.326 A:middle
colored tokens into slots on a

00:15:31.326 --> 00:15:32.986 A:middle
vertical 2D gameboard.

00:15:33.606 --> 00:15:34.686 A:middle
The goal is to get four of your

00:15:34.686 --> 00:15:36.276 A:middle
tokens in a line and block the

00:15:36.276 --> 00:15:37.636 A:middle
other player from doing so.

00:15:38.386 --> 00:15:39.566 A:middle
How can I design it to be

00:15:39.566 --> 00:15:41.346 A:middle
accessible from the ground up?

00:15:42.276 --> 00:15:44.096 A:middle
Today, we're going to talk about

00:15:44.096 --> 00:15:45.036 A:middle
how I can make my game

00:15:45.036 --> 00:15:46.896 A:middle
accessible thinking about four

00:15:46.896 --> 00:15:49.326 A:middle
areas of accessibility; vision,

00:15:49.466 --> 00:15:51.546 A:middle
motor, hearing, and cognition.

00:15:52.126 --> 00:15:53.676 A:middle
These cover huge spectrum of

00:15:53.676 --> 00:15:55.306 A:middle
abilities, but we'll focus on

00:15:55.306 --> 00:15:57.206 A:middle
some key points in each category

00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:58.396 A:middle
and how they relate to Four in a

00:15:58.396 --> 00:16:00.146 A:middle
Row, and likely your game as

00:16:00.146 --> 00:16:00.406 A:middle
well.

00:16:02.056 --> 00:16:03.906 A:middle
First, let's think about vision.

00:16:03.906 --> 00:16:06.666 A:middle
In the context of our game, the

00:16:06.946 --> 00:16:08.626 A:middle
key areas we'll focus on are

00:16:08.786 --> 00:16:11.386 A:middle
color, motion, dynamic type, and

00:16:11.386 --> 00:16:12.416 A:middle
VoiceOver support.

00:16:12.416 --> 00:16:15.686 A:middle
One of the key visual elements

00:16:15.686 --> 00:16:16.496 A:middle
of this game is the

00:16:16.496 --> 00:16:17.936 A:middle
differentiation between the two

00:16:17.936 --> 00:16:18.686 A:middle
player's tokens.

00:16:19.286 --> 00:16:21.056 A:middle
Here, one player is green and

00:16:21.056 --> 00:16:22.006 A:middle
the other is red.

00:16:22.876 --> 00:16:24.186 A:middle
These colors can be really hard

00:16:24.186 --> 00:16:25.426 A:middle
to distinguish for someone who

00:16:25.426 --> 00:16:26.956 A:middle
is colorblind, or doesn't see

00:16:26.956 --> 00:16:27.586 A:middle
color at all.

00:16:29.036 --> 00:16:30.286 A:middle
Here's what the same colors may

00:16:30.286 --> 00:16:31.476 A:middle
look like to someone who has a

00:16:31.476 --> 00:16:32.576 A:middle
type of colorblindness.

00:16:33.486 --> 00:16:36.356 A:middle
Let's take a look at how some

00:16:36.356 --> 00:16:37.846 A:middle
other apps differentiate without

00:16:37.846 --> 00:16:38.896 A:middle
color in their games.

00:16:39.546 --> 00:16:41.236 A:middle
In Causality, the characters are

00:16:41.236 --> 00:16:42.636 A:middle
defined by the colors of the

00:16:42.766 --> 00:16:43.906 A:middle
stripes of their helmets.

00:16:44.646 --> 00:16:45.536 A:middle
So, take a look at their

00:16:45.536 --> 00:16:48.226 A:middle
helmets, and then this is what

00:16:48.226 --> 00:16:49.406 A:middle
it looks like in the colorblind

00:16:49.406 --> 00:16:49.746 A:middle
mode.

00:16:49.996 --> 00:16:50.626 A:middle
You can go back.

00:16:51.466 --> 00:16:54.226 A:middle
So, they've added these shapes

00:16:54.226 --> 00:16:55.356 A:middle
that go along with the colors to

00:16:55.356 --> 00:16:56.916 A:middle
help distinguish between the

00:16:56.916 --> 00:16:58.436 A:middle
characters in their color

00:16:59.096 --> 00:17:00.386 A:middle
colorblind friendly mode.

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:03.406 A:middle
We can build off that idea and

00:17:03.406 --> 00:17:04.736 A:middle
use shapes as well as colors in

00:17:04.736 --> 00:17:05.146 A:middle
our game.

00:17:05.146 --> 00:17:08.456 A:middle
Now, let's talk about how we'll

00:17:08.456 --> 00:17:09.896 A:middle
use motion in our game.

00:17:10.136 --> 00:17:11.556 A:middle
And you may want to close your

00:17:11.556 --> 00:17:12.786 A:middle
eyes for a second if you get

00:17:13.216 --> 00:17:14.056 A:middle
motion sickness.

00:17:15.026 --> 00:17:16.966 A:middle
Okay, so this is the really cool

00:17:16.966 --> 00:17:18.346 A:middle
animation I wanted to do in the

00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:19.446 A:middle
background of my game.

00:17:19.826 --> 00:17:21.216 A:middle
Not at all distracting.

00:17:21.256 --> 00:17:24.256 A:middle
I think it will be a big hit.

00:17:24.256 --> 00:17:25.426 A:middle
OK you can open your eyes.

00:17:25.966 --> 00:17:27.416 A:middle
Some people experience motion

00:17:27.416 --> 00:17:29.086 A:middle
sicknesses from these kinds of

00:17:29.086 --> 00:17:29.886 A:middle
animations.

00:17:30.296 --> 00:17:31.656 A:middle
Motion sickness happens when

00:17:31.656 --> 00:17:32.976 A:middle
some of your senses tell you

00:17:32.976 --> 00:17:34.556 A:middle
you're moving, but others don't.

00:17:35.056 --> 00:17:36.316 A:middle
When you're using your phone,

00:17:36.426 --> 00:17:37.996 A:middle
your eyes see motion, but you

00:17:37.996 --> 00:17:39.256 A:middle
don't feel it in your muscles,

00:17:39.256 --> 00:17:40.176 A:middle
or your inner ear.

00:17:41.266 --> 00:17:42.706 A:middle
Motion sickness from computers

00:17:42.706 --> 00:17:44.006 A:middle
is actually really common.

00:17:44.056 --> 00:17:46.376 A:middle
In one study, 70% of adults

00:17:46.376 --> 00:17:47.676 A:middle
reported motion sickness while

00:17:47.676 --> 00:17:49.966 A:middle
playing a game.

00:17:50.446 --> 00:17:51.836 A:middle
In my Four in a Row game, I'll

00:17:51.836 --> 00:17:53.086 A:middle
make another background with

00:17:53.146 --> 00:17:54.896 A:middle
less motion to follow the reduce

00:17:54.896 --> 00:17:56.026 A:middle
motion setting on iOS.

00:17:57.056 --> 00:17:58.376 A:middle
This doesn't have to be a static

00:17:58.376 --> 00:18:01.006 A:middle
image, just tighten up the

00:18:01.116 --> 00:18:02.806 A:middle
physics of the motion so there

00:18:02.806 --> 00:18:04.006 A:middle
is less motion overall.

00:18:04.486 --> 00:18:06.926 A:middle
You can find out more about

00:18:06.926 --> 00:18:08.956 A:middle
designing for reduce motion on

00:18:08.956 --> 00:18:11.176 A:middle
the WebKit blog.

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:12.806 A:middle
Another accessibility setting to

00:18:12.806 --> 00:18:14.376 A:middle
design for is dynamic type.

00:18:15.806 --> 00:18:17.476 A:middle
Dynamic type or larger text

00:18:17.476 --> 00:18:19.316 A:middle
sizes for users with low vision

00:18:19.656 --> 00:18:20.876 A:middle
lets users go beyond the

00:18:20.876 --> 00:18:22.526 A:middle
standard text sizes to something

00:18:22.526 --> 00:18:24.486 A:middle
that's easier for them to read.

00:18:25.456 --> 00:18:26.806 A:middle
Your game should support the

00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:28.466 A:middle
standard text sizes as well as

00:18:28.466 --> 00:18:30.046 A:middle
an accessibility text sizes,

00:18:30.046 --> 00:18:31.376 A:middle
which go up to accessibility

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:33.206 A:middle
extra, extra, extra-large.

00:18:34.336 --> 00:18:35.456 A:middle
We'll want to test set out our

00:18:35.456 --> 00:18:36.656 A:middle
game with some different text

00:18:36.656 --> 00:18:37.926 A:middle
sizes to make sure our layouts

00:18:37.926 --> 00:18:40.186 A:middle
accommodate them.

00:18:40.736 --> 00:18:41.896 A:middle
You can learn more about making

00:18:41.896 --> 00:18:43.526 A:middle
your app work with dynamic type

00:18:43.526 --> 00:18:45.226 A:middle
at the Dynamic Type Session and

00:18:45.226 --> 00:18:45.976 A:middle
Labs on Friday.

00:18:46.776 --> 00:18:49.716 A:middle
So, we've done a lot to make our

00:18:49.716 --> 00:18:51.596 A:middle
game more accessible for sighted

00:18:51.596 --> 00:18:53.586 A:middle
users with vision problems, but

00:18:53.586 --> 00:18:54.906 A:middle
what about low vision or blind

00:18:54.936 --> 00:18:55.416 A:middle
players.

00:18:56.296 --> 00:18:57.576 A:middle
A lot of players may be playing

00:18:57.576 --> 00:18:59.246 A:middle
your game using VoiceOver, the

00:18:59.246 --> 00:19:00.586 A:middle
screen reader that comes built

00:19:00.586 --> 00:19:02.476 A:middle
in on all your Apple devices and

00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:04.056 A:middle
let's players who are blind hear

00:19:04.056 --> 00:19:05.296 A:middle
everything that's on screen.

00:19:05.776 --> 00:19:08.266 A:middle
Here's an example of how

00:19:08.266 --> 00:19:09.176 A:middle
VoiceOver works.

00:19:09.756 --> 00:19:11.076 A:middle
On my phone, I'm going to swipe

00:19:11.076 --> 00:19:12.906 A:middle
across the screen to move the

00:19:12.906 --> 00:19:13.866 A:middle
different elements and hear

00:19:13.866 --> 00:19:15.166 A:middle
VoiceOver read them to me.

00:19:15.666 --> 00:19:17.186 A:middle
Then I'll tap on the screen and

00:19:17.186 --> 00:19:18.426 A:middle
hear what's under my finger, and

00:19:18.556 --> 00:19:20.006 A:middle
then I'll double tap to press an

00:19:20.006 --> 00:19:21.696 A:middle
element, in this case open an

00:19:21.696 --> 00:19:21.846 A:middle
app.

00:19:22.106 --> 00:19:22.646 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Dock, phone.

00:19:27.596 --> 00:19:28.066 A:middle
Phone.

00:19:29.816 --> 00:19:30.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, when it's moving through

00:19:30.876 --> 00:19:31.806 A:middle
those elements you saw the

00:19:31.806 --> 00:19:32.626 A:middle
little square going.

00:19:32.626 --> 00:19:34.006 A:middle
It also says what it is.

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.616 A:middle
And so, that way a VoiceOver

00:19:35.616 --> 00:19:37.056 A:middle
user can hear everything that's

00:19:37.056 --> 00:19:37.806 A:middle
on their screen.

00:19:38.356 --> 00:19:41.716 A:middle
If you're using AppKit or UIKit

00:19:41.716 --> 00:19:42.806 A:middle
without a lot of custom

00:19:42.806 --> 00:19:44.736 A:middle
controls, your game should

00:19:44.736 --> 00:19:45.986 A:middle
already work pretty well with

00:19:46.026 --> 00:19:46.666 A:middle
VoiceOver.

00:19:47.216 --> 00:19:48.716 A:middle
If you do have custom controls

00:19:48.716 --> 00:19:50.006 A:middle
or images, you can use the

00:19:50.006 --> 00:19:51.826 A:middle
accessibility API to finish

00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:54.566 A:middle
making your app accessible.

00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:56.256 A:middle
For example, in my game I have

00:19:56.256 --> 00:19:57.476 A:middle
these tokens that are custom

00:19:57.476 --> 00:19:57.886 A:middle
views.

00:19:58.226 --> 00:19:59.546 A:middle
And I want VoiceOver to say the

00:19:59.546 --> 00:20:00.676 A:middle
right thing when it lands on

00:20:00.676 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
them.

00:20:01.286 --> 00:20:02.636 A:middle
Let's go with player A and

00:20:02.636 --> 00:20:03.246 A:middle
player B.

00:20:03.816 --> 00:20:06.366 A:middle
I can use these strings of the

00:20:06.366 --> 00:20:08.146 A:middle
accessibility label property to

00:20:08.146 --> 00:20:09.686 A:middle
label these elements.

00:20:10.716 --> 00:20:12.386 A:middle
Now, when VoiceOver lands on a

00:20:12.386 --> 00:20:13.716 A:middle
token it will say its name

00:20:13.716 --> 00:20:14.316 A:middle
properly.

00:20:14.896 --> 00:20:15.826 A:middle
And you can learn more about

00:20:15.826 --> 00:20:16.856 A:middle
that in the What's New in

00:20:16.856 --> 00:20:18.346 A:middle
Accessibility Talk that was just

00:20:18.346 --> 00:20:19.396 A:middle
on the screen before that.

00:20:19.396 --> 00:20:20.266 A:middle
It's going to be available

00:20:20.266 --> 00:20:22.076 A:middle
online and they went into some

00:20:22.076 --> 00:20:23.206 A:middle
more detail about using the

00:20:23.206 --> 00:20:25.076 A:middle
accessibility API.

00:20:26.576 --> 00:20:28.536 A:middle
So, for vision we thought about

00:20:28.696 --> 00:20:30.186 A:middle
three key points for our Four in

00:20:30.186 --> 00:20:30.786 A:middle
Row game.

00:20:31.546 --> 00:20:32.986 A:middle
First, we used shapes and

00:20:32.986 --> 00:20:33.436 A:middle
colors.

00:20:33.576 --> 00:20:34.676 A:middle
So, there's more than one type

00:20:34.676 --> 00:20:36.026 A:middle
of indicator for players who are

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:36.796 A:middle
colorblind.

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:39.176 A:middle
We provided alternate

00:20:39.176 --> 00:20:40.836 A:middle
experiences for reduced motion

00:20:40.836 --> 00:20:41.726 A:middle
and dynamic type.

00:20:42.876 --> 00:20:44.226 A:middle
And we made sure all of our

00:20:44.226 --> 00:20:45.686 A:middle
elements were accessible and

00:20:45.686 --> 00:20:46.796 A:middle
labeled for VoiceOver.

00:20:49.536 --> 00:20:50.936 A:middle
When you're designing a game for

00:20:51.056 --> 00:20:52.996 A:middle
iOS or macOS you're usually

00:20:52.996 --> 00:20:54.316 A:middle
thinking about players swiping

00:20:54.316 --> 00:20:55.776 A:middle
on a screen or typing on a

00:20:55.776 --> 00:20:56.186 A:middle
keyboard.

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.786 A:middle
However, your players may be

00:20:58.786 --> 00:21:00.246 A:middle
playing your game using

00:21:00.246 --> 00:21:01.856 A:middle
assistive technologies like

00:21:01.916 --> 00:21:03.516 A:middle
Touch Accommodations, the

00:21:03.516 --> 00:21:04.786 A:middle
Accessibility Keyboard,

00:21:05.066 --> 00:21:06.666 A:middle
Alternative Inputs, and Switch

00:21:06.666 --> 00:21:07.046 A:middle
Control.

00:21:07.616 --> 00:21:10.246 A:middle
Some of your players might have

00:21:10.246 --> 00:21:11.526 A:middle
difficulties with fine motor

00:21:11.526 --> 00:21:13.456 A:middle
skills like from arthritis that

00:21:13.456 --> 00:21:14.776 A:middle
make it difficult for them to

00:21:15.186 --> 00:21:17.356 A:middle
accurately swipe and tap in your

00:21:17.356 --> 00:21:17.776 A:middle
game.

00:21:18.416 --> 00:21:19.716 A:middle
These players may use the Touch

00:21:19.716 --> 00:21:21.296 A:middle
Accommodations and Accessibility

00:21:21.296 --> 00:21:22.856 A:middle
Settings to make it easier for

00:21:22.856 --> 00:21:23.836 A:middle
them to interact with their

00:21:23.836 --> 00:21:24.256 A:middle
phone.

00:21:24.936 --> 00:21:26.386 A:middle
However, it's still a good idea

00:21:26.386 --> 00:21:27.506 A:middle
to think about how you can make

00:21:27.506 --> 00:21:28.816 A:middle
it easier to swipe and tap in

00:21:28.816 --> 00:21:29.306 A:middle
your game.

00:21:29.876 --> 00:21:32.746 A:middle
In my Four in a Row app, players

00:21:32.746 --> 00:21:34.366 A:middle
tap on a column to drop in their

00:21:34.366 --> 00:21:35.016 A:middle
token.

00:21:35.496 --> 00:21:36.386 A:middle
I want to make sure these

00:21:36.416 --> 00:21:37.846 A:middle
targets are large and clearly

00:21:37.846 --> 00:21:40.336 A:middle
defined, so it's easy for users

00:21:40.336 --> 00:21:41.306 A:middle
to hit them.

00:21:41.606 --> 00:21:43.086 A:middle
The Human Interface Guidelines

00:21:43.086 --> 00:21:45.286 A:middle
recommends a minimum area of 44

00:21:45.286 --> 00:21:47.536 A:middle
by 44 for topical elements.

00:21:48.956 --> 00:21:50.386 A:middle
If you're designing a game for

00:21:50.386 --> 00:21:52.286 A:middle
macOS, players might be using

00:21:52.286 --> 00:21:53.546 A:middle
the Accessibility Keyboard to

00:21:53.546 --> 00:21:54.246 A:middle
play your game.

00:21:54.996 --> 00:21:56.466 A:middle
Instead of typing on a physical

00:21:56.466 --> 00:21:58.076 A:middle
keyboard, players use the

00:21:58.076 --> 00:22:00.136 A:middle
trackpad, mouse or dwell control

00:22:00.136 --> 00:22:01.576 A:middle
to select keys on screen.

00:22:02.146 --> 00:22:03.266 A:middle
Your game should just work with

00:22:03.266 --> 00:22:04.776 A:middle
the Accessibility Keyboard, but

00:22:04.776 --> 00:22:06.006 A:middle
you may have to provide some

00:22:06.006 --> 00:22:07.066 A:middle
options for keys.

00:22:07.866 --> 00:22:09.416 A:middle
If your game requires pressing

00:22:09.416 --> 00:22:10.816 A:middle
and releasing multiple keys at

00:22:10.816 --> 00:22:13.166 A:middle
the same time, offer an option

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:14.466 A:middle
for just pressing a single key

00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:16.446 A:middle
instead, or allow a press and

00:22:16.446 --> 00:22:18.026 A:middle
hold so players can use sticky

00:22:18.086 --> 00:22:18.366 A:middle
keys.

00:22:18.876 --> 00:22:21.526 A:middle
You can hear more about the

00:22:21.526 --> 00:22:22.816 A:middle
Accessibility Keyboard in the

00:22:22.816 --> 00:22:24.026 A:middle
What's New in Accessibility

00:22:24.026 --> 00:22:24.306 A:middle
Talk.

00:22:25.106 --> 00:22:28.126 A:middle
Other players may be playing

00:22:28.126 --> 00:22:29.616 A:middle
your game through alternative

00:22:29.616 --> 00:22:31.316 A:middle
external inputs like braille

00:22:31.316 --> 00:22:33.236 A:middle
displays, HID controllers, and

00:22:33.236 --> 00:22:34.516 A:middle
external keywords in iOS.

00:22:35.456 --> 00:22:36.586 A:middle
These are great options for

00:22:36.586 --> 00:22:37.826 A:middle
players who have difficulties in

00:22:37.826 --> 00:22:39.306 A:middle
motor skills, or repetitive

00:22:39.306 --> 00:22:40.166 A:middle
strain injuries.

00:22:41.276 --> 00:22:42.636 A:middle
Supporting keyboards for things

00:22:42.636 --> 00:22:43.486 A:middle
like typing could be

00:22:43.486 --> 00:22:44.496 A:middle
straightforward in your game,

00:22:44.716 --> 00:22:45.856 A:middle
but you may have to do a little

00:22:45.856 --> 00:22:46.316 A:middle
extra.

00:22:46.316 --> 00:22:47.926 A:middle
For example, in Four in a Row,

00:22:48.236 --> 00:22:49.186 A:middle
we needed to implement a

00:22:49.186 --> 00:22:50.896 A:middle
selection mechanism for players

00:22:50.896 --> 00:22:52.116 A:middle
to be able to select a column

00:22:52.116 --> 00:22:53.136 A:middle
using a keyboard.

00:22:53.646 --> 00:22:56.806 A:middle
Other players might be playing

00:22:56.806 --> 00:22:58.186 A:middle
your game using Switch Control,

00:22:58.476 --> 00:22:59.636 A:middle
an assistive technology

00:22:59.636 --> 00:23:01.786 A:middle
available on macOS, iOS and

00:23:01.786 --> 00:23:02.236 A:middle
tvOS.

00:23:03.076 --> 00:23:04.356 A:middle
Switch Control lets you control

00:23:04.356 --> 00:23:05.546 A:middle
your device with one or more

00:23:05.546 --> 00:23:07.746 A:middle
switches which are like buttons

00:23:07.746 --> 00:23:09.226 A:middle
that can be pressed by a hand, a

00:23:09.226 --> 00:23:11.726 A:middle
head, or another body part.

00:23:12.576 --> 00:23:13.856 A:middle
When you're using a single

00:23:13.926 --> 00:23:15.846 A:middle
switch, Switch Control scans all

00:23:15.846 --> 00:23:17.806 A:middle
items on screen and then you can

00:23:17.806 --> 00:23:19.196 A:middle
tap your switch when it lands on

00:23:19.196 --> 00:23:19.906 A:middle
the item you want.

00:23:20.806 --> 00:23:22.806 A:middle
So, here Switch Control is on

00:23:22.806 --> 00:23:24.036 A:middle
and it's scanning everything in

00:23:24.036 --> 00:23:26.036 A:middle
Sushi Go, and then when it lands

00:23:26.036 --> 00:23:27.866 A:middle
on my sushi, I tap my switch.

00:23:28.436 --> 00:23:29.386 A:middle
And I select my sushi.

00:23:29.826 --> 00:23:31.916 A:middle
So, the good news is that if you

00:23:31.916 --> 00:23:32.736 A:middle
already made your game

00:23:32.736 --> 00:23:34.686 A:middle
accessible using the accessibly

00:23:34.686 --> 00:23:36.726 A:middle
API for VoiceOver, which is used

00:23:36.726 --> 00:23:38.256 A:middle
by players who are blind, it

00:23:38.256 --> 00:23:39.366 A:middle
should also work with Switch

00:23:39.366 --> 00:23:39.786 A:middle
Control.

00:23:40.366 --> 00:23:41.756 A:middle
That means that games like Sushi

00:23:41.756 --> 00:23:42.936 A:middle
Go can be played with just a

00:23:42.936 --> 00:23:43.726 A:middle
single button.

00:23:44.296 --> 00:23:47.726 A:middle
In my Four in a Row app, I added

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:49.576 A:middle
a cool erase gesture that clears

00:23:49.576 --> 00:23:51.056 A:middle
the board when a user swipes in

00:23:51.056 --> 00:23:51.896 A:middle
a zigzag.

00:23:53.146 --> 00:23:54.416 A:middle
However, this could be really

00:23:54.416 --> 00:23:55.496 A:middle
difficult for players who are

00:23:55.496 --> 00:23:56.776 A:middle
using Switch Control or Touch

00:23:56.776 --> 00:23:57.596 A:middle
Accommodations.

00:23:58.166 --> 00:23:59.336 A:middle
So, I'll put an option on my

00:23:59.336 --> 00:24:01.076 A:middle
settings to use buttons instead

00:24:01.076 --> 00:24:02.736 A:middle
of these gestures, so Switch

00:24:02.736 --> 00:24:04.116 A:middle
users can use that instead.

00:24:05.976 --> 00:24:07.126 A:middle
When designing for players with

00:24:07.126 --> 00:24:08.576 A:middle
difficulties of motor skills,

00:24:08.616 --> 00:24:09.636 A:middle
you want to make sure that your

00:24:09.636 --> 00:24:11.386 A:middle
targets are clearly defined and

00:24:11.386 --> 00:24:12.646 A:middle
easy to hit.

00:24:13.576 --> 00:24:15.066 A:middle
Try to provide for different

00:24:15.066 --> 00:24:16.456 A:middle
inputs in your game, like

00:24:16.456 --> 00:24:17.556 A:middle
testing it out with Switch

00:24:17.556 --> 00:24:19.016 A:middle
Control or HID controller.

00:24:21.366 --> 00:24:22.686 A:middle
Provide options for custom

00:24:22.686 --> 00:24:24.116 A:middle
gestures so your game is still

00:24:24.306 --> 00:24:25.946 A:middle
playable with a single switch.

00:24:28.256 --> 00:24:30.006 A:middle
Players in my game might be deaf

00:24:30.006 --> 00:24:31.346 A:middle
or hard of hearing and I want to

00:24:31.346 --> 00:24:32.266 A:middle
make sure they're not missing

00:24:32.266 --> 00:24:33.776 A:middle
out on any of the experience by

00:24:33.776 --> 00:24:35.066 A:middle
providing captions and alert

00:24:35.066 --> 00:24:35.596 A:middle
options.

00:24:36.116 --> 00:24:39.656 A:middle
In my Four in a Row game, I want

00:24:39.656 --> 00:24:40.916 A:middle
to have a single player mode

00:24:40.916 --> 00:24:42.326 A:middle
where the AI speaks taunting

00:24:42.326 --> 00:24:43.616 A:middle
remarks throughout the game to

00:24:43.616 --> 00:24:44.986 A:middle
increase the competition.

00:24:45.406 --> 00:24:47.096 A:middle
However, my players may be deaf

00:24:47.096 --> 00:24:49.276 A:middle
or hard of hearing.

00:24:49.426 --> 00:24:50.726 A:middle
Grim Fandango is a complex

00:24:50.726 --> 00:24:51.966 A:middle
adventure app with a lot of

00:24:51.966 --> 00:24:54.416 A:middle
dialogue, but it lets users pick

00:24:54.416 --> 00:24:56.466 A:middle
between just speech, just text,

00:24:56.926 --> 00:24:58.256 A:middle
and speech with text.

00:24:59.356 --> 00:25:00.686 A:middle
I'll use the techniques Greg

00:25:00.686 --> 00:25:02.756 A:middle
described earlier to add audio

00:25:03.406 --> 00:25:04.616 A:middle
to my game.

00:25:04.616 --> 00:25:05.886 A:middle
Accessibility Settings let your

00:25:05.886 --> 00:25:06.966 A:middle
players customize the

00:25:06.966 --> 00:25:08.206 A:middle
environment to fit their needs.

00:25:08.656 --> 00:25:10.346 A:middle
In Grim Fandango, there's also

00:25:10.346 --> 00:25:12.016 A:middle
different sliders for adjusting

00:25:12.016 --> 00:25:13.466 A:middle
the different types of volume in

00:25:13.466 --> 00:25:13.806 A:middle
the game.

00:25:13.806 --> 00:25:15.516 A:middle
And this is a great option for

00:25:15.516 --> 00:25:16.726 A:middle
players who are hard of hearing,

00:25:16.726 --> 00:25:18.216 A:middle
because that way you can select

00:25:18.596 --> 00:25:19.756 A:middle
what you want your music volume

00:25:19.756 --> 00:25:21.236 A:middle
to be versus what you want the

00:25:21.236 --> 00:25:22.756 A:middle
volume to be for any speech, for

00:25:22.756 --> 00:25:23.266 A:middle
example.

00:25:24.086 --> 00:25:25.596 A:middle
Depending on your game, you

00:25:25.596 --> 00:25:26.896 A:middle
might also want to offer sound

00:25:26.896 --> 00:25:28.506 A:middle
effect options, so players with

00:25:28.506 --> 00:25:29.896 A:middle
hearing loss in one range can

00:25:30.306 --> 00:25:31.176 A:middle
select sound that's in a

00:25:31.176 --> 00:25:31.936 A:middle
different range.

00:25:33.196 --> 00:25:35.026 A:middle
In my Four in a Row game, I want

00:25:35.026 --> 00:25:36.086 A:middle
to use sounds that fill the

00:25:36.086 --> 00:25:37.706 A:middle
spectrum, so more people can

00:25:37.706 --> 00:25:38.256 A:middle
hear them.

00:25:38.626 --> 00:25:40.476 A:middle
I also want my sound effects to

00:25:40.476 --> 00:25:41.776 A:middle
be really noticeable for all

00:25:41.776 --> 00:25:42.196 A:middle
players.

00:25:42.536 --> 00:25:43.666 A:middle
So, I'll combine them with

00:25:44.086 --> 00:25:45.736 A:middle
screen flashes or haptics on

00:25:45.736 --> 00:25:46.796 A:middle
supported devices.

00:25:47.326 --> 00:25:50.766 A:middle
Deaf or hard of hearing players

00:25:50.766 --> 00:25:52.356 A:middle
will enjoy your game a lot more

00:25:52.356 --> 00:25:53.906 A:middle
if you provide captions for any

00:25:53.906 --> 00:25:54.056 A:middle
text.

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:56.476 A:middle
Depending on your sound effects,

00:25:56.546 --> 00:25:57.626 A:middle
you'll want to try to use full

00:25:57.626 --> 00:26:00.146 A:middle
spectrum sounds, or add audio

00:26:00.146 --> 00:26:01.686 A:middle
options so players can select

00:26:01.686 --> 00:26:04.366 A:middle
what sounds work best for them.

00:26:04.366 --> 00:26:05.646 A:middle
Try using multiple ways of

00:26:05.646 --> 00:26:07.336 A:middle
getting player's attention, like

00:26:07.336 --> 00:26:08.776 A:middle
screen flashes or haptics.

00:26:09.256 --> 00:26:10.686 A:middle
Some of my players might have

00:26:10.686 --> 00:26:12.346 A:middle
cognitive and neurodevelopmental

00:26:12.346 --> 00:26:16.056 A:middle
disorders like ADHD, autism, or

00:26:16.056 --> 00:26:16.506 A:middle
dementia.

00:26:17.106 --> 00:26:18.786 A:middle
These cover a wide spectrum and

00:26:18.856 --> 00:26:20.006 A:middle
so it will be really helpful to

00:26:20.006 --> 00:26:21.626 A:middle
get feedback from my users about

00:26:21.626 --> 00:26:22.876 A:middle
what challenges they encountered

00:26:22.876 --> 00:26:23.706 A:middle
while playing Four in a Row.

00:26:24.586 --> 00:26:25.986 A:middle
However, there are some key

00:26:25.986 --> 00:26:27.286 A:middle
areas I can focus on while

00:26:27.286 --> 00:26:29.146 A:middle
developing my game, such as

00:26:29.246 --> 00:26:30.686 A:middle
options for audio and visuals,

00:26:31.136 --> 00:26:32.676 A:middle
providing help and tutorials,

00:26:33.346 --> 00:26:35.216 A:middle
supporting Guided Access, and

00:26:35.216 --> 00:26:36.496 A:middle
offering different game modes.

00:26:38.436 --> 00:26:40.236 A:middle
When we looked at Grim Fandango,

00:26:40.476 --> 00:26:41.666 A:middle
one great option was the

00:26:41.666 --> 00:26:43.696 A:middle
combination of voice and text.

00:26:44.036 --> 00:26:45.226 A:middle
This is a great option for

00:26:45.226 --> 00:26:46.756 A:middle
players to comprehend better

00:26:46.756 --> 00:26:48.516 A:middle
when there's a mixture of sound

00:26:48.516 --> 00:26:49.936 A:middle
and visuals in the game.

00:26:50.616 --> 00:26:51.556 A:middle
I'll make sure to provide an

00:26:51.556 --> 00:26:52.666 A:middle
option like that in Four in a

00:26:52.666 --> 00:26:52.966 A:middle
Row.

00:26:53.416 --> 00:26:56.236 A:middle
Another thing I want to provide

00:26:56.236 --> 00:26:57.846 A:middle
in my game is easy access to the

00:26:57.846 --> 00:26:58.666 A:middle
instructions.

00:26:59.176 --> 00:27:00.326 A:middle
For players with attention or

00:27:00.326 --> 00:27:01.726 A:middle
memory problems, it can be

00:27:01.726 --> 00:27:02.926 A:middle
really difficult to remember

00:27:02.926 --> 00:27:04.386 A:middle
instructions or rules they

00:27:04.386 --> 00:27:05.306 A:middle
encountered when they first

00:27:05.306 --> 00:27:06.106 A:middle
played the game.

00:27:07.136 --> 00:27:07.876 A:middle
Solivad [assumed spelling] has a

00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:09.596 A:middle
ton of versions of solitaire and

00:27:09.596 --> 00:27:10.806 A:middle
it can be hard to remember all

00:27:10.806 --> 00:27:12.576 A:middle
their nuances, but they all have

00:27:12.576 --> 00:27:14.146 A:middle
a rules button available from

00:27:14.146 --> 00:27:15.226 A:middle
the same screen where you play

00:27:15.226 --> 00:27:15.626 A:middle
the game.

00:27:16.096 --> 00:27:17.606 A:middle
I'll do the same thing in Four

00:27:17.606 --> 00:27:18.816 A:middle
in a Row, and add a button to

00:27:18.816 --> 00:27:20.156 A:middle
the game playing screen, so

00:27:20.156 --> 00:27:21.176 A:middle
players can get back to the

00:27:21.176 --> 00:27:21.496 A:middle
rules.

00:27:21.586 --> 00:27:24.536 A:middle
Some of my players will want to

00:27:24.536 --> 00:27:25.706 A:middle
play my game through Guided

00:27:25.706 --> 00:27:26.126 A:middle
Access.

00:27:26.766 --> 00:27:28.336 A:middle
Guided Access offers players

00:27:28.336 --> 00:27:29.736 A:middle
another way to experience your

00:27:30.516 --> 00:27:30.656 A:middle
app.

00:27:30.656 --> 00:27:32.186 A:middle
A parent or caretaker can set up

00:27:32.186 --> 00:27:33.896 A:middle
restrictions on the game so the

00:27:33.896 --> 00:27:35.286 A:middle
Guided Access user can just

00:27:35.336 --> 00:27:36.786 A:middle
focus on what's really important

00:27:36.786 --> 00:27:37.996 A:middle
to enjoy playing the game.

00:27:38.736 --> 00:27:40.836 A:middle
For example, in Four in a Row, I

00:27:40.836 --> 00:27:42.286 A:middle
have this Auto Play button

00:27:42.286 --> 00:27:43.946 A:middle
that's a little confusing, it

00:27:43.946 --> 00:27:45.276 A:middle
lets the phone play against

00:27:45.276 --> 00:27:46.746 A:middle
itself and so players who

00:27:46.746 --> 00:27:48.686 A:middle
stumble across it might not know

00:27:48.686 --> 00:27:50.016 A:middle
what happened or how to get back

00:27:50.016 --> 00:27:51.106 A:middle
to just playing the game.

00:27:51.786 --> 00:27:53.756 A:middle
In Guided Access, a caretaker

00:27:53.756 --> 00:27:55.396 A:middle
could put a restriction around

00:27:55.536 --> 00:27:56.716 A:middle
that button so that way the

00:27:56.716 --> 00:27:58.106 A:middle
Guided Access user can just

00:27:58.106 --> 00:27:59.536 A:middle
enjoy the game without worrying

00:27:59.536 --> 00:28:01.686 A:middle
about accidentally pressing it.

00:28:02.506 --> 00:28:03.756 A:middle
If your game has things that it

00:28:03.756 --> 00:28:05.016 A:middle
would make sense to restrict,

00:28:05.066 --> 00:28:07.136 A:middle
you can use custom restrictions

00:28:07.136 --> 00:28:08.296 A:middle
in the accessibility API.

00:28:09.286 --> 00:28:10.386 A:middle
These are used in setting up

00:28:10.386 --> 00:28:12.596 A:middle
Guided Access in an app.

00:28:12.706 --> 00:28:14.446 A:middle
And then when the player plays

00:28:14.446 --> 00:28:16.196 A:middle
them, those things are hidden or

00:28:16.196 --> 00:28:17.576 A:middle
locked, so they can't

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:21.176 A:middle
accidentally use them.

00:28:22.056 --> 00:28:24.036 A:middle
You may also want to provide

00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:25.476 A:middle
different modes in your game.

00:28:25.826 --> 00:28:27.056 A:middle
Real Racing has different

00:28:27.056 --> 00:28:28.956 A:middle
options for drivers that lets

00:28:29.196 --> 00:28:30.726 A:middle
players focus on one aspect of

00:28:30.726 --> 00:28:31.556 A:middle
the game at a time.

00:28:32.626 --> 00:28:33.936 A:middle
Depending on your game it might

00:28:33.936 --> 00:28:34.856 A:middle
make sense to use different

00:28:34.856 --> 00:28:36.526 A:middle
levels instead, but you want to

00:28:36.526 --> 00:28:37.716 A:middle
make sure you're not preventing

00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:39.806 A:middle
players from completing your

00:28:40.576 --> 00:28:40.686 A:middle
game.

00:28:41.176 --> 00:28:42.276 A:middle
I want Four and a Row to be

00:28:42.276 --> 00:28:43.846 A:middle
timed, so players really feel

00:28:43.846 --> 00:28:45.006 A:middle
the pressure when making their

00:28:45.006 --> 00:28:45.356 A:middle
move.

00:28:45.956 --> 00:28:47.546 A:middle
However, a timed version could

00:28:47.546 --> 00:28:48.836 A:middle
be a lot less fun for a lot of

00:28:48.876 --> 00:28:50.266 A:middle
players, including those with

00:28:50.266 --> 00:28:51.666 A:middle
cognitive disabilities.

00:28:52.196 --> 00:28:53.726 A:middle
So, I'll add another option for

00:28:53.726 --> 00:28:55.316 A:middle
an untimed mode in the game as

00:28:55.316 --> 00:28:55.556 A:middle
well.

00:28:56.896 --> 00:28:58.786 A:middle
I've added leaderboards to Four

00:28:58.786 --> 00:29:00.256 A:middle
in a Row, but I have to think

00:29:00.256 --> 00:29:01.746 A:middle
about what ranking means to my

00:29:01.746 --> 00:29:02.196 A:middle
players.

00:29:02.706 --> 00:29:04.606 A:middle
I have diverse set of players

00:29:04.736 --> 00:29:05.756 A:middle
playing my game in many

00:29:05.756 --> 00:29:07.106 A:middle
different ways, and I don't want

00:29:07.106 --> 00:29:08.026 A:middle
it to feel unfair.

00:29:08.516 --> 00:29:10.196 A:middle
I'll create leaderboards for the

00:29:10.196 --> 00:29:11.256 A:middle
different modes that you can

00:29:11.256 --> 00:29:12.866 A:middle
play my game in so that way

00:29:12.916 --> 00:29:14.356 A:middle
players in the untimed mode can

00:29:14.356 --> 00:29:15.746 A:middle
compete against each other

00:29:16.056 --> 00:29:16.986 A:middle
without worrying about what

00:29:16.986 --> 00:29:18.216 A:middle
times the players in the timed

00:29:18.216 --> 00:29:19.146 A:middle
mode are achieving.

00:29:20.636 --> 00:29:22.726 A:middle
Cognitive accessibility covers a

00:29:22.726 --> 00:29:24.326 A:middle
wide range of users, and there's

00:29:24.326 --> 00:29:25.656 A:middle
a lot you can do in your game.

00:29:26.906 --> 00:29:28.186 A:middle
Use multiple methods for

00:29:28.186 --> 00:29:29.866 A:middle
providing content like speech

00:29:29.866 --> 00:29:30.676 A:middle
with captions.

00:29:31.786 --> 00:29:33.306 A:middle
Make instructions and tutorials

00:29:33.306 --> 00:29:34.726 A:middle
easy to access while playing the

00:29:34.726 --> 00:29:35.196 A:middle
game.

00:29:36.316 --> 00:29:38.586 A:middle
Support Guided Access so players

00:29:38.586 --> 00:29:39.536 A:middle
can focus on just what's

00:29:39.536 --> 00:29:40.896 A:middle
important to enjoy the game.

00:29:41.436 --> 00:29:42.686 A:middle
And offer different game modes

00:29:42.686 --> 00:29:44.326 A:middle
or levels, each with their own

00:29:44.326 --> 00:29:45.786 A:middle
leaderboards, so players can

00:29:45.786 --> 00:29:46.636 A:middle
compete fairly.

00:29:46.886 --> 00:29:48.036 A:middle
OK, so now I want to show you

00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:48.936 A:middle
some of the Accessibility

00:29:48.936 --> 00:29:50.146 A:middle
Settings we did in our game.

00:29:55.106 --> 00:29:56.616 A:middle
So, I have my game running in

00:29:56.616 --> 00:29:57.946 A:middle
the simulator right now with the

00:29:57.946 --> 00:29:59.056 A:middle
Accessibility Inspector.

00:29:59.056 --> 00:30:00.736 A:middle
And I found the Accessibility

00:30:00.736 --> 00:30:02.116 A:middle
Inspector in Xcode under

00:30:02.116 --> 00:30:03.086 A:middle
Developer Tools.

00:30:03.206 --> 00:30:04.496 A:middle
And there's a lot you can do

00:30:04.496 --> 00:30:04.746 A:middle
here.

00:30:04.746 --> 00:30:05.686 A:middle
And I'm not really going to go

00:30:05.686 --> 00:30:06.806 A:middle
into it because there's a really

00:30:06.806 --> 00:30:07.986 A:middle
great talk in it last year.

00:30:08.496 --> 00:30:09.936 A:middle
But over here you can inspect

00:30:09.936 --> 00:30:10.396 A:middle
your app.

00:30:10.396 --> 00:30:11.396 A:middle
And so, it will tell you what

00:30:11.396 --> 00:30:12.396 A:middle
different accessibility

00:30:12.396 --> 00:30:13.936 A:middle
information it can get about the

00:30:13.936 --> 00:30:15.036 A:middle
things in your app.

00:30:15.436 --> 00:30:16.856 A:middle
Or you could run an audit which

00:30:16.856 --> 00:30:18.036 A:middle
is really helpful, because it

00:30:18.036 --> 00:30:18.986 A:middle
will just highlight some

00:30:18.986 --> 00:30:20.396 A:middle
different accessibility bugs you

00:30:20.396 --> 00:30:21.436 A:middle
might have in your game.

00:30:22.246 --> 00:30:23.146 A:middle
But, today we're going to look

00:30:23.146 --> 00:30:23.956 A:middle
at the settings tab.

00:30:23.956 --> 00:30:26.116 A:middle
And this is really cool, because

00:30:26.116 --> 00:30:27.606 A:middle
it lets you test different

00:30:27.786 --> 00:30:29.186 A:middle
accessibility settings without

00:30:29.186 --> 00:30:29.966 A:middle
leaving your game.

00:30:30.296 --> 00:30:31.296 A:middle
And I'm just doing this on the

00:30:31.296 --> 00:30:33.176 A:middle
simulator, but up here if you

00:30:33.176 --> 00:30:34.326 A:middle
have your phone plugged in, you

00:30:34.326 --> 00:30:36.726 A:middle
can actually pick your phone too

00:30:37.006 --> 00:30:38.346 A:middle
and so you could do it on device

00:30:38.346 --> 00:30:39.726 A:middle
and that way you don't have to

00:30:39.726 --> 00:30:41.496 A:middle
leave your game and like go into

00:30:41.496 --> 00:30:42.356 A:middle
settings and go back.

00:30:42.396 --> 00:30:43.126 A:middle
So, it's really handy.

00:30:43.776 --> 00:30:45.666 A:middle
So, one that we did was reduce

00:30:45.666 --> 00:30:46.546 A:middle
transparency.

00:30:46.586 --> 00:30:47.506 A:middle
And for that we just did a

00:30:47.506 --> 00:30:49.146 A:middle
simple black background to make

00:30:49.146 --> 00:30:50.536 A:middle
the gameboard really stand out.

00:30:51.736 --> 00:30:53.246 A:middle
We also supported different font

00:30:53.246 --> 00:30:54.786 A:middle
sizes for dynamic type.

00:30:54.786 --> 00:30:56.066 A:middle
So, there's a slider here and I

00:30:56.066 --> 00:30:57.616 A:middle
can just make the fonts bigger

00:30:57.616 --> 00:30:58.276 A:middle
or smaller.

00:30:59.286 --> 00:31:00.966 A:middle
And the next one is invert

00:31:00.966 --> 00:31:01.446 A:middle
colors.

00:31:01.446 --> 00:31:03.466 A:middle
And to know why we implemented

00:31:03.466 --> 00:31:04.956 A:middle
it the way we did, you have to

00:31:04.956 --> 00:31:06.326 A:middle
know a little bit about how it's

00:31:06.326 --> 00:31:06.846 A:middle
used.

00:31:07.286 --> 00:31:09.016 A:middle
So, invert colors is used by

00:31:09.116 --> 00:31:10.506 A:middle
players who have difficulty

00:31:10.506 --> 00:31:12.226 A:middle
reading dark text on a light

00:31:12.276 --> 00:31:13.036 A:middle
background because the

00:31:13.036 --> 00:31:14.326 A:middle
brightness of the background

00:31:14.406 --> 00:31:15.606 A:middle
interferes with their vision.

00:31:15.976 --> 00:31:17.486 A:middle
So, they'll use invert colors,

00:31:17.486 --> 00:31:18.916 A:middle
to make that light text on a

00:31:18.916 --> 00:31:20.026 A:middle
dark background instead.

00:31:20.966 --> 00:31:22.186 A:middle
Since our game is already like

00:31:22.256 --> 00:31:23.946 A:middle
that, we used the accessibility

00:31:23.946 --> 00:31:25.496 A:middle
API to tell it not to invert

00:31:25.496 --> 00:31:26.656 A:middle
colors for this screen.

00:31:27.066 --> 00:31:28.636 A:middle
So, when I do invert colors,

00:31:29.046 --> 00:31:30.096 A:middle
nothing happens.

00:31:30.256 --> 00:31:31.646 A:middle
But if I go to like settings,

00:31:31.646 --> 00:31:33.636 A:middle
which is normally white, it's

00:31:33.636 --> 00:31:34.126 A:middle
all black.

00:31:34.396 --> 00:31:36.626 A:middle
And then if I uncheck it, it

00:31:36.626 --> 00:31:38.006 A:middle
goes back to white.

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:40.056 A:middle
So, we have a lot of different

00:31:40.056 --> 00:31:41.306 A:middle
settings here in this game that

00:31:41.706 --> 00:31:43.046 A:middle
we added for accessibility

00:31:43.046 --> 00:31:43.466 A:middle
reasons.

00:31:43.466 --> 00:31:44.786 A:middle
So, let's check that out as

00:31:44.786 --> 00:31:45.036 A:middle
well.

00:31:46.496 --> 00:31:48.786 A:middle
So, here's my Four in a Row app.

00:31:48.786 --> 00:31:50.136 A:middle
I can just tap on a column to

00:31:50.136 --> 00:31:50.796 A:middle
make a move.

00:31:51.896 --> 00:31:53.686 A:middle
But more exciting than the game

00:31:53.686 --> 00:31:54.846 A:middle
is the settings.

00:31:55.116 --> 00:31:56.626 A:middle
And we have a lot here.

00:31:57.016 --> 00:31:58.216 A:middle
So, first is volume.

00:31:58.516 --> 00:32:00.296 A:middle
We added different sliders for

00:32:00.296 --> 00:32:01.646 A:middle
the speech and the sound effects

00:32:01.646 --> 00:32:03.236 A:middle
because people who are hard of

00:32:03.306 --> 00:32:05.516 A:middle
hearing might want to emphasize

00:32:05.516 --> 00:32:06.586 A:middle
the speech over the sound

00:32:06.586 --> 00:32:06.956 A:middle
effects.

00:32:07.556 --> 00:32:08.716 A:middle
So, we could turn down the sound

00:32:08.716 --> 00:32:08.976 A:middle
effects.

00:32:11.536 --> 00:32:13.536 A:middle
We also have captions.

00:32:13.536 --> 00:32:14.956 A:middle
And so, those are just going

00:32:14.956 --> 00:32:16.306 A:middle
directly from the settings for

00:32:16.306 --> 00:32:16.926 A:middle
your phone.

00:32:17.526 --> 00:32:18.586 A:middle
And we have Differentiate

00:32:18.586 --> 00:32:19.256 A:middle
Without Color.

00:32:19.256 --> 00:32:21.626 A:middle
And if you noticed before, right

00:32:21.626 --> 00:32:22.856 A:middle
now it's all circles.

00:32:23.316 --> 00:32:24.766 A:middle
But when I turn on Differentiate

00:32:24.766 --> 00:32:27.266 A:middle
Without Colors, we made it so

00:32:27.266 --> 00:32:28.616 A:middle
now it's circles and triangles.

00:32:28.616 --> 00:32:30.216 A:middle
So, it's easier to tell apart

00:32:30.816 --> 00:32:31.716 A:middle
the different players.

00:32:32.316 --> 00:32:34.526 A:middle
So, we have a lot of other

00:32:34.626 --> 00:32:35.946 A:middle
settings here, but the one I

00:32:35.946 --> 00:32:38.016 A:middle
wanted to focus on was timing.

00:32:39.046 --> 00:32:40.916 A:middle
We added a Turn Time slider

00:32:40.916 --> 00:32:42.336 A:middle
which is great because that

00:32:42.336 --> 00:32:44.076 A:middle
gives players who have trouble

00:32:44.076 --> 00:32:45.096 A:middle
coming up their next move or

00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:46.646 A:middle
difficulty moving that quickly

00:32:46.696 --> 00:32:48.016 A:middle
some extra time to make their

00:32:48.016 --> 00:32:48.426 A:middle
move.

00:32:49.006 --> 00:32:49.956 A:middle
But for now, I'm going to turn

00:32:49.956 --> 00:32:51.076 A:middle
off the timed mode because I'm

00:32:51.076 --> 00:32:52.066 A:middle
going to be testing this out

00:32:52.066 --> 00:32:53.566 A:middle
with some assistive technologies

00:32:53.996 --> 00:32:55.626 A:middle
and the combination me using

00:32:55.626 --> 00:32:56.646 A:middle
them and talking about them is

00:32:56.646 --> 00:32:57.526 A:middle
going to slow me down a little

00:32:57.526 --> 00:32:57.796 A:middle
bit.

00:32:58.406 --> 00:33:01.446 A:middle
So, oh, yeah and I'm already

00:33:01.536 --> 00:33:02.646 A:middle
very close to losing.

00:33:02.736 --> 00:33:04.076 A:middle
So, I'm glad I turned that off.

00:33:04.156 --> 00:33:05.686 A:middle
Okay, so now I'm going to test

00:33:05.686 --> 00:33:07.216 A:middle
it out with VoiceOver.

00:33:07.526 --> 00:33:09.166 A:middle
And I have VoiceOver set up on

00:33:09.166 --> 00:33:10.456 A:middle
my accessibility shortcut.

00:33:10.886 --> 00:33:12.296 A:middle
So, I can just triple tap on

00:33:12.366 --> 00:33:14.386 A:middle
home and turn on voice over.

00:33:15.056 --> 00:33:15.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on.

00:33:16.086 --> 00:33:16.666 A:middle
Landscape.

00:33:16.786 --> 00:33:17.736 A:middle
Four in a Row.

00:33:17.736 --> 00:33:18.856 A:middle
Empty image.

00:33:19.726 --> 00:33:21.116 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, it's labelled.

00:33:21.116 --> 00:33:21.536 A:middle
That's good.

00:33:21.536 --> 00:33:23.396 A:middle
And I can swipe through and hear

00:33:23.396 --> 00:33:25.376 A:middle
all the cells in the gameboard.

00:33:25.806 --> 00:33:28.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Move empty image, empty

00:33:28.656 --> 00:33:30.716 A:middle
image, empty image.

00:33:32.106 --> 00:33:34.166 A:middle
Winner, four question marks.

00:33:34.166 --> 00:33:35.956 A:middle
Actions of player B, image.

00:33:35.956 --> 00:33:37.186 A:middle
Player B image.

00:33:37.966 --> 00:33:41.396 A:middle
Actions available.

00:33:41.616 --> 00:33:43.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, I can move to everything.

00:33:43.806 --> 00:33:45.426 A:middle
It's labelled, it's accessible,

00:33:45.426 --> 00:33:46.746 A:middle
but when I was testing this out

00:33:46.746 --> 00:33:48.566 A:middle
earlier in VoiceOver, I found it

00:33:48.566 --> 00:33:49.776 A:middle
just wasn't a really fun

00:33:49.776 --> 00:33:50.326 A:middle
experience.

00:33:50.326 --> 00:33:52.356 A:middle
It was too hard to move through

00:33:52.356 --> 00:33:53.766 A:middle
all the different slots on the

00:33:53.766 --> 00:33:55.856 A:middle
gameboard, keep track in your

00:33:55.856 --> 00:33:56.936 A:middle
head of which ones were filled

00:33:56.936 --> 00:33:57.966 A:middle
and which weren't and come up

00:33:57.966 --> 00:33:59.556 A:middle
with what your next move should

00:33:59.556 --> 00:33:59.836 A:middle
be.

00:34:00.646 --> 00:34:02.116 A:middle
So, I used something in the

00:34:02.116 --> 00:34:03.636 A:middle
accessibility API called the

00:34:03.636 --> 00:34:05.216 A:middle
Custom Action to improve that

00:34:05.216 --> 00:34:05.956 A:middle
experience.

00:34:06.346 --> 00:34:07.846 A:middle
I added an action that switches

00:34:07.846 --> 00:34:09.306 A:middle
you from moving by cell to

00:34:09.306 --> 00:34:10.156 A:middle
moving by column.

00:34:10.666 --> 00:34:12.086 A:middle
Let's do that.

00:34:13.356 --> 00:34:16.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Move by cell, move by column.

00:34:16.786 --> 00:34:20.606 A:middle
Column 3, 4 empty cells, 2

00:34:20.606 --> 00:34:21.656 A:middle
player A tokens.

00:34:22.776 --> 00:34:24.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, that way VoiceOver can

00:34:24.256 --> 00:34:25.606 A:middle
move via column instead of by

00:34:25.606 --> 00:34:27.376 A:middle
cell and that makes it a lot

00:34:27.376 --> 00:34:28.636 A:middle
easier for me to just get a

00:34:28.636 --> 00:34:30.056 A:middle
sense of what the gameboard is

00:34:30.056 --> 00:34:30.123 A:middle
in.

00:34:30.123 --> 00:34:32.266 A:middle
And that technique I used for

00:34:32.266 --> 00:34:34.216 A:middle
making it move by column instead

00:34:34.216 --> 00:34:35.516 A:middle
of by cell was also really

00:34:35.516 --> 00:34:36.636 A:middle
helpful for Switch Control.

00:34:36.636 --> 00:34:37.686 A:middle
So, let me show you that.

00:34:37.686 --> 00:34:39.276 A:middle
I'm going to turn off VoiceOver

00:34:39.276 --> 00:34:40.306 A:middle
and switch over to Switch

00:34:40.306 --> 00:34:40.676 A:middle
Control.

00:34:41.836 --> 00:34:43.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Alert. Accessibility list

00:34:43.686 --> 00:34:44.966 A:middle
control button.

00:34:45.146 --> 00:34:45.976 A:middle
VoiceOver off.

00:34:48.426 --> 00:34:50.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; OK, so now I have Switch

00:34:50.406 --> 00:34:51.846 A:middle
Control on and I have my switch

00:34:51.846 --> 00:34:52.166 A:middle
here.

00:34:52.776 --> 00:34:54.816 A:middle
And Switch Control is scanning

00:34:54.816 --> 00:34:57.096 A:middle
all the things, I'm sorry.

00:34:57.126 --> 00:34:58.316 A:middle
Switch Control is scanning all

00:34:58.316 --> 00:34:59.876 A:middle
the items on the screen and so

00:34:59.876 --> 00:35:02.396 A:middle
when I go into the gameboard,

00:35:02.876 --> 00:35:04.236 A:middle
it's going to, before it was

00:35:04.236 --> 00:35:06.236 A:middle
going by cell, and it was super

00:35:06.236 --> 00:35:07.826 A:middle
tedious to try to wait for it to

00:35:07.826 --> 00:35:09.536 A:middle
go through each cell to get to

00:35:09.536 --> 00:35:10.556 A:middle
the one that I wanted.

00:35:11.026 --> 00:35:12.126 A:middle
But now, when I go into the

00:35:12.126 --> 00:35:14.556 A:middle
gameboard, it's going by column

00:35:14.556 --> 00:35:15.726 A:middle
instead of by cell, which it did

00:35:15.726 --> 00:35:16.876 A:middle
originally, and so I was able to

00:35:16.876 --> 00:35:18.516 A:middle
use accessibility API to change

00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:19.566 A:middle
that experience to make it

00:35:19.566 --> 00:35:19.866 A:middle
better.

00:35:20.316 --> 00:35:21.696 A:middle
So now I can just press my

00:35:21.696 --> 00:35:24.246 A:middle
switch and make my move.

00:35:26.536 --> 00:35:28.196 A:middle
So, let me show you some other

00:35:28.256 --> 00:35:29.486 A:middle
things that we did.

00:35:29.796 --> 00:35:30.976 A:middle
Let me turn off Switch Control.

00:35:33.826 --> 00:35:34.986 A:middle
And right now, if you're

00:35:34.986 --> 00:35:36.986 A:middle
noticing I have my screen setup

00:35:36.986 --> 00:35:38.036 A:middle
to be a switch too.

00:35:38.036 --> 00:35:40.056 A:middle
And that's an awesome option for

00:35:40.056 --> 00:35:41.086 A:middle
testing, because that way you

00:35:41.086 --> 00:35:42.436 A:middle
don't need to set up a switch.

00:35:42.516 --> 00:35:44.716 A:middle
So, you're just, your phone

00:35:44.716 --> 00:35:45.716 A:middle
works as a switch.

00:35:46.396 --> 00:35:48.446 A:middle
Okay, so we also made it work

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:49.086 A:middle
with a keyboard.

00:35:49.086 --> 00:35:50.226 A:middle
And so, I mentioned earlier for

00:35:50.226 --> 00:35:51.406 A:middle
that, you needed to do a

00:35:51.406 --> 00:35:53.356 A:middle
selection mechanism, so that way

00:35:53.356 --> 00:35:55.586 A:middle
when I hit the arrow keys, I can

00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:57.256 A:middle
move by column, and then just

00:35:57.256 --> 00:35:59.246 A:middle
press space to make my move.

00:36:00.996 --> 00:36:03.736 A:middle
So, providing these options for

00:36:03.736 --> 00:36:04.726 A:middle
these different assistive

00:36:04.726 --> 00:36:06.036 A:middle
technologies really broadens

00:36:06.036 --> 00:36:06.836 A:middle
into my audience.

00:36:06.836 --> 00:36:07.956 A:middle
It means a lot more people will

00:36:07.956 --> 00:36:09.246 A:middle
be able to play our game.

00:36:09.786 --> 00:36:12.576 A:middle
We were able to make a lot of

00:36:12.576 --> 00:36:13.766 A:middle
improvements to our game by

00:36:13.766 --> 00:36:14.896 A:middle
testing it out with different

00:36:14.896 --> 00:36:16.136 A:middle
assistive technologies and

00:36:16.136 --> 00:36:17.496 A:middle
accessibility settings.

00:36:18.216 --> 00:36:19.116 A:middle
When you're doing this, it can

00:36:19.116 --> 00:36:20.686 A:middle
be easy to fall into the trap of

00:36:20.686 --> 00:36:22.116 A:middle
following the letter of the law,

00:36:22.116 --> 00:36:23.136 A:middle
but not the spirit.

00:36:23.526 --> 00:36:25.186 A:middle
As well as being accessible, you

00:36:25.186 --> 00:36:26.466 A:middle
want your game to be fun to play

00:36:26.466 --> 00:36:27.186 A:middle
for everyone.

00:36:28.106 --> 00:36:29.826 A:middle
The accessibility API offers a

00:36:29.826 --> 00:36:31.256 A:middle
lot of great tools for improving

00:36:31.256 --> 00:36:32.306 A:middle
that experience.

00:36:33.696 --> 00:36:35.036 A:middle
Now, you may be thinking about

00:36:35.036 --> 00:36:36.606 A:middle
your own app and how you can get

00:36:36.696 --> 00:36:38.056 A:middle
started making it accessible.

00:36:38.666 --> 00:36:39.926 A:middle
The three things you can do the

00:36:39.926 --> 00:36:41.556 A:middle
minute you walk out of here are

00:36:41.556 --> 00:36:43.696 A:middle
to audit your app, test it out

00:36:43.696 --> 00:36:44.756 A:middle
with different accessibility

00:36:44.756 --> 00:36:46.746 A:middle
settings, and most importantly,

00:36:46.856 --> 00:36:48.196 A:middle
talk to assistive technology

00:36:48.196 --> 00:36:48.886 A:middle
users.

00:36:49.286 --> 00:36:52.956 A:middle
So, we already mentioned this

00:36:53.016 --> 00:36:53.986 A:middle
talk a little bit, but it's

00:36:53.986 --> 00:36:54.556 A:middle
really good.

00:36:54.556 --> 00:36:55.456 A:middle
So, you can learn more about

00:36:55.456 --> 00:36:56.766 A:middle
both auditing your app and

00:36:56.766 --> 00:36:57.906 A:middle
testing it with accessibility

00:36:57.906 --> 00:36:59.746 A:middle
settings and Auditing your Apps

00:36:59.746 --> 00:37:01.296 A:middle
for Accessibility talk from last

00:37:01.296 --> 00:37:01.466 A:middle
year.

00:37:02.036 --> 00:37:04.916 A:middle
It's really important to test

00:37:04.916 --> 00:37:06.256 A:middle
out your game with assistive

00:37:06.256 --> 00:37:07.646 A:middle
technologies, but you should

00:37:07.646 --> 00:37:09.126 A:middle
also try to talk to the users

00:37:09.126 --> 00:37:10.186 A:middle
who use them every day.

00:37:10.806 --> 00:37:11.696 A:middle
They'll have a firsthand

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:13.036 A:middle
experience of what separates a

00:37:13.036 --> 00:37:14.446 A:middle
good experience from a great

00:37:14.446 --> 00:37:14.876 A:middle
experience.

00:37:14.876 --> 00:37:16.316 A:middle
And they'll probably have a lot

00:37:16.316 --> 00:37:17.646 A:middle
of ideas for how you can make

00:37:17.646 --> 00:37:18.836 A:middle
your game more accessible.

00:37:19.456 --> 00:37:20.366 A:middle
You can connect with

00:37:20.366 --> 00:37:21.666 A:middle
accessibility users and

00:37:21.666 --> 00:37:23.136 A:middle
developers at our get-together

00:37:23.136 --> 00:37:23.456 A:middle
tonight.

00:37:24.696 --> 00:37:25.616 A:middle
Designing your game for

00:37:25.616 --> 00:37:27.296 A:middle
accessibility really means more

00:37:27.296 --> 00:37:28.966 A:middle
people can enjoy it.

00:37:29.716 --> 00:37:31.026 A:middle
When you're designing for

00:37:31.026 --> 00:37:32.336 A:middle
accessibility think about how

00:37:32.336 --> 00:37:33.616 A:middle
accessibility is really a

00:37:33.616 --> 00:37:34.206 A:middle
spectrum.

00:37:34.386 --> 00:37:35.576 A:middle
So, you want to create these

00:37:35.636 --> 00:37:37.326 A:middle
different great experiences so

00:37:37.496 --> 00:37:38.966 A:middle
each player can find out their

00:37:38.966 --> 00:37:39.716 A:middle
own perfect fit.

00:37:39.716 --> 00:37:42.606 A:middle
At the end of the day, your game

00:37:42.606 --> 00:37:43.876 A:middle
will be stronger and richer,

00:37:43.876 --> 00:37:45.156 A:middle
because designing for

00:37:45.156 --> 00:37:46.436 A:middle
accessibility is really

00:37:46.436 --> 00:37:47.616 A:middle
designing for everyone.

00:37:48.136 --> 00:37:50.636 A:middle
You can find out more

00:37:50.636 --> 00:37:52.656 A:middle
information on and the developer

00:37:52.656 --> 00:37:53.136 A:middle
website.

00:37:53.136 --> 00:37:54.226 A:middle
You can see this session again,

00:37:54.226 --> 00:37:55.426 A:middle
and I think we have some notes

00:37:55.426 --> 00:37:56.406 A:middle
and information there.

00:37:57.806 --> 00:37:59.386 A:middle
There's a lot of other related

00:37:59.386 --> 00:38:00.886 A:middle
sessions going on this week and

00:38:00.886 --> 00:38:01.886 A:middle
there's more that you can see

00:38:01.886 --> 00:38:03.426 A:middle
online from some previous years.

00:38:04.416 --> 00:38:05.656 A:middle
Thank you and enjoy the rest the

00:38:05.656 --> 00:38:05.946 A:middle
conference.
