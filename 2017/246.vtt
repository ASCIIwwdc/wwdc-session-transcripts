00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:20.926 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to Deep

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:22.046 A:middle
Linking on tvOS.

00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:23.546 A:middle
Today we will be looking at best

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:24.836 A:middle
practices for supporting deep

00:00:24.836 --> 00:00:27.666 A:middle
links in your tvOS app.

00:00:28.106 --> 00:00:29.286 A:middle
So what is a deep link?

00:00:29.856 --> 00:00:31.406 A:middle
A deep link is a URL that your

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:32.556 A:middle
application knows how to open.

00:00:33.176 --> 00:00:34.136 A:middle
We call these links in deep

00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:35.316 A:middle
because they often refer to

00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:36.846 A:middle
content that's a few levels down

00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:38.006 A:middle
in your App2i.

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:39.516 A:middle
Instead of manually navigating

00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:41.206 A:middle
through several screens, a user

00:00:41.206 --> 00:00:42.226 A:middle
can jump immediately to the

00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:43.406 A:middle
content they want by using the

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:43.636 A:middle
deep link.

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:47.576 A:middle
Deep link URLs can be sent to

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:48.826 A:middle
your app from various parts of

00:00:48.826 --> 00:00:50.156 A:middle
the system or even other

00:00:50.156 --> 00:00:50.846 A:middle
applications.

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.166 A:middle
One common source of deep links

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.386 A:middle
is your application's top shelf

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:54.896 A:middle
extension.

00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.246 A:middle
If you have a top shelf

00:00:56.246 --> 00:00:57.706 A:middle
extension, it communicates with

00:00:57.706 --> 00:00:58.946 A:middle
your app using deep links.

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:00.596 A:middle
The code [inaudible] handles

00:01:00.596 --> 00:01:01.836 A:middle
links from the top shelf can

00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:03.096 A:middle
also be used to handle links

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:03.976 A:middle
from any other source.

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:07.786 A:middle
If you're not familiar with a

00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:09.506 A:middle
top shelf, here's an example of

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:10.806 A:middle
the top shelf extension for the

00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:11.586 A:middle
iTunes movie sound.

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:13.676 A:middle
Each item in the top shelf will

00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:14.876 A:middle
open a different movie in the

00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:15.806 A:middle
iTunes movie app.

00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:19.066 A:middle
Because these links are meant

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.566 A:middle
for your application, we

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.206 A:middle
recommend that you use universal

00:01:22.206 --> 00:01:22.556 A:middle
links.

00:01:23.276 --> 00:01:24.996 A:middle
Universal links can also be used

00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:26.316 A:middle
in your iOS app, if you have

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:26.516 A:middle
one.

00:01:27.206 --> 00:01:28.646 A:middle
Unlike rolling your own custom

00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:30.546 A:middle
URL scheme, universal links

00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:31.836 A:middle
ensure that the link is always

00:01:31.836 --> 00:01:32.856 A:middle
routed to your application.

00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:34.576 A:middle
And that the data is in a format

00:01:34.576 --> 00:01:35.616 A:middle
your application expects.

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:37.266 A:middle
For more information about

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.916 A:middle
universal links, see the web

00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:39.976 A:middle
page at this URL.

00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:45.606 A:middle
So, now that you know what a

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:46.956 A:middle
deep link is and where they come

00:01:46.956 --> 00:01:48.376 A:middle
from, let's take a look at what

00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:49.216 A:middle
you should do when your

00:01:49.216 --> 00:01:50.336 A:middle
application is asked to open

00:01:50.336 --> 00:01:50.516 A:middle
one.

00:01:51.336 --> 00:01:52.476 A:middle
The most important part is to

00:01:52.476 --> 00:01:53.476 A:middle
take the user to the link

00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:55.316 A:middle
content immediately, without any

00:01:55.316 --> 00:01:56.726 A:middle
loading screens or animated

00:01:56.726 --> 00:01:57.356 A:middle
transitions.

00:01:57.486 --> 00:01:59.156 A:middle
You should avoid any alerts

00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:00.446 A:middle
asking if the user is sure that

00:02:00.446 --> 00:02:01.986 A:middle
they want to open the link or

00:02:01.986 --> 00:02:02.966 A:middle
sure that they want to start

00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:03.596 A:middle
playing the video.

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:05.706 A:middle
It's also important to make sure

00:02:05.996 --> 00:02:07.126 A:middle
that when the user leaves link

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.706 A:middle
content, they're able to orient

00:02:08.706 --> 00:02:09.546 A:middle
themselves in your app.

00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:11.216 A:middle
Even when jumping somewhere

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:12.966 A:middle
directly, the user should always

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.496 A:middle
know where they are and how they

00:02:14.496 --> 00:02:14.846 A:middle
got there.

00:02:17.286 --> 00:02:18.446 A:middle
How should you display deep link

00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:18.896 A:middle
content?

00:02:19.246 --> 00:02:20.216 A:middle
Well, it depends on the link.

00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:21.676 A:middle
Let's take a look at the top

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:22.456 A:middle
shelf items again.

00:02:24.226 --> 00:02:25.866 A:middle
Each top shelf item supports two

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:27.976 A:middle
URLs, the displayURL and the

00:02:27.976 --> 00:02:28.556 A:middle
playURL.

00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:30.626 A:middle
The displayURL is opened when

00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:31.796 A:middle
the user presses a select

00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:33.286 A:middle
button, and this should take the

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:34.666 A:middle
user to a detail page for the

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:35.376 A:middle
top shelf item.

00:02:35.966 --> 00:02:37.146 A:middle
And typically this detail page

00:02:37.146 --> 00:02:38.486 A:middle
will include a way to play the

00:02:38.486 --> 00:02:39.966 A:middle
item, if the item is a video.

00:02:40.756 --> 00:02:42.036 A:middle
The playURL is opened when the

00:02:42.036 --> 00:02:43.196 A:middle
user presses the Play button.

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.076 A:middle
This is a shortcut that lets the

00:02:45.076 --> 00:02:46.316 A:middle
user immediately start video

00:02:46.316 --> 00:02:47.456 A:middle
playback for the item.

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:51.106 A:middle
Remember, the displayURL should

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:52.566 A:middle
take the user to a detail page

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:53.126 A:middle
for the item.

00:02:53.946 --> 00:02:55.416 A:middle
Menuing out of this detail page

00:02:55.646 --> 00:02:56.636 A:middle
should take the user back to

00:02:56.636 --> 00:02:57.966 A:middle
your application's main screen.

00:02:58.656 --> 00:02:59.706 A:middle
Now it could be that the user

00:02:59.706 --> 00:03:00.846 A:middle
would normally have to navigate

00:03:00.876 --> 00:03:02.516 A:middle
through several levels to get to

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:03.996 A:middle
the detail page from the main

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:05.536 A:middle
screen, but they shouldn't have

00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:06.996 A:middle
to take multiple steps to back

00:03:06.996 --> 00:03:07.716 A:middle
out of a deep link.

00:03:08.386 --> 00:03:09.936 A:middle
Instead, the first Menu press

00:03:09.936 --> 00:03:11.096 A:middle
should take them back to the top

00:03:11.096 --> 00:03:12.136 A:middle
level of your application.

00:03:12.876 --> 00:03:14.356 A:middle
Because it's the top level, a

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:15.666 A:middle
second Menu press should exit

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:17.496 A:middle
the app and return to the tvOS

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:17.966 A:middle
home screen.

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.356 A:middle
And here's an illustration of

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:22.106 A:middle
what that looks like.

00:03:22.526 --> 00:03:23.986 A:middle
Here, I've opened a deep link in

00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:24.816 A:middle
a simple video app.

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:26.736 A:middle
The first screen I'm taken to is

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:28.016 A:middle
a detail page for the video I've

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:28.446 A:middle
selected.

00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:30.946 A:middle
Pressing Menu once takes me back

00:03:30.946 --> 00:03:33.256 A:middle
to my app's main screen, which

00:03:33.256 --> 00:03:34.436 A:middle
shows a grid of all the videos

00:03:34.436 --> 00:03:35.076 A:middle
that I can watch.

00:03:35.726 --> 00:03:37.286 A:middle
Pressing Menu again will exit my

00:03:37.286 --> 00:03:39.676 A:middle
app and take me back to the tvOS

00:03:39.676 --> 00:03:40.116 A:middle
home screen.

00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:44.346 A:middle
Now let's look at how to handle

00:03:44.346 --> 00:03:45.016 A:middle
a playURL.

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:46.666 A:middle
Remember, this should

00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:48.116 A:middle
immediately begin video playback

00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:48.646 A:middle
for the item.

00:03:49.306 --> 00:03:50.146 A:middle
Your app should start with a

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:51.876 A:middle
black screen and then fade in

00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:52.336 A:middle
the video.

00:03:53.056 --> 00:03:54.246 A:middle
Try to avoid any visible

00:03:54.246 --> 00:03:55.906 A:middle
transitions or user interaction

00:03:55.906 --> 00:03:57.876 A:middle
and this is especially important

00:03:57.876 --> 00:03:59.426 A:middle
for resuming playback of a video

00:03:59.496 --> 00:04:00.856 A:middle
that the user's already started

00:04:00.856 --> 00:04:01.256 A:middle
watching.

00:04:02.256 --> 00:04:03.586 A:middle
Pressing Menu to exit playback

00:04:03.856 --> 00:04:05.016 A:middle
should take the user to the same

00:04:05.016 --> 00:04:06.706 A:middle
detail page you would have shown

00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:08.476 A:middle
if the displayURL had been sent.

00:04:09.146 --> 00:04:10.346 A:middle
From there, the navigation is

00:04:10.346 --> 00:04:11.196 A:middle
the same as before.

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:13.536 A:middle
Menuing out of the detail page,

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:14.536 A:middle
it should go to your apps main

00:04:14.536 --> 00:04:16.396 A:middle
screen and a second Menu press

00:04:16.446 --> 00:04:17.876 A:middle
should return to the tvOS home

00:04:17.876 --> 00:04:18.176 A:middle
screen.

00:04:20.796 --> 00:04:21.796 A:middle
And here's an illustration of

00:04:21.796 --> 00:04:22.496 A:middle
what that looks like.

00:04:23.156 --> 00:04:23.986 A:middle
You can see that the first

00:04:23.986 --> 00:04:25.856 A:middle
screen is a video playback and

00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:27.326 A:middle
then behind that, it's the same

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:28.966 A:middle
hierarchy as if we had opened

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:30.146 A:middle
the displayURL.

00:04:32.796 --> 00:04:33.866 A:middle
Now let's take a quick look at a

00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:34.836 A:middle
demo to really see these

00:04:34.876 --> 00:04:35.736 A:middle
concepts in action.

00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:37.966 A:middle
Here's a simple app that lets me

00:04:37.966 --> 00:04:40.006 A:middle
play some of my favorite videos

00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:40.426 A:middle
from WWDC.

00:04:40.796 --> 00:04:41.876 A:middle
I can get to the videos from

00:04:41.876 --> 00:04:44.876 A:middle
within the app, but there's also

00:04:44.876 --> 00:04:46.176 A:middle
a top shelf extension that lets

00:04:46.176 --> 00:04:47.386 A:middle
me jump to the videos directly

00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:47.976 A:middle
from the tvOS home screen.

00:04:52.146 --> 00:04:53.416 A:middle
If I press select on a top shelf

00:04:53.416 --> 00:04:55.846 A:middle
item, I'm taken directly to the

00:04:55.846 --> 00:04:57.276 A:middle
detail page for that video.

00:04:59.986 --> 00:05:00.976 A:middle
If I go back to the top shelf --

00:05:04.986 --> 00:05:06.366 A:middle
And press play on a different

00:05:06.366 --> 00:05:10.816 A:middle
item, the app starts playing

00:05:10.816 --> 00:05:11.426 A:middle
that video.

00:05:12.466 --> 00:05:14.536 A:middle
Menuing out of playback takes me

00:05:14.536 --> 00:05:15.976 A:middle
to the detail page for the item

00:05:15.976 --> 00:05:16.876 A:middle
I was just watching.

00:05:17.706 --> 00:05:18.726 A:middle
You'll remember that this isn't

00:05:18.726 --> 00:05:20.086 A:middle
the same item I was looking at

00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:22.026 A:middle
when I was last in the app and

00:05:22.026 --> 00:05:23.056 A:middle
that's because when the app

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:24.026 A:middle
opened the link from the top

00:05:24.026 --> 00:05:26.346 A:middle
shelf, it reconfigured its UI to

00:05:26.346 --> 00:05:27.406 A:middle
display the link content.

00:05:28.816 --> 00:05:30.176 A:middle
Menu again takes me out of the

00:05:30.176 --> 00:05:32.096 A:middle
detail page and into the app's

00:05:32.096 --> 00:05:32.646 A:middle
main screen.

00:05:33.626 --> 00:05:35.276 A:middle
Pressing Menu a third time exits

00:05:35.316 --> 00:05:37.346 A:middle
the app and takes me back to the

00:05:37.346 --> 00:05:38.036 A:middle
tvOS home screen.

00:05:39.216 --> 00:05:40.266 A:middle
Let's take a quick look at the

00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:41.526 A:middle
code that handles deep linking

00:05:41.526 --> 00:05:42.056 A:middle
in this app.

00:05:42.716 --> 00:05:43.666 A:middle
The work happens in the app

00:05:43.696 --> 00:05:45.506 A:middle
delegate, specifically, the

00:05:45.506 --> 00:05:47.356 A:middle
application open url with

00:05:47.356 --> 00:05:48.116 A:middle
options method.

00:05:49.736 --> 00:05:51.606 A:middle
First, when we reconfigure our

00:05:51.606 --> 00:05:53.536 A:middle
UI to display a deep link, we

00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:55.006 A:middle
want to do so without animation.

00:05:55.626 --> 00:05:56.716 A:middle
This means that the content will

00:05:56.716 --> 00:05:58.016 A:middle
already be displayed when the

00:05:58.016 --> 00:05:58.936 A:middle
system switches to our

00:05:58.936 --> 00:05:59.456 A:middle
application.

00:06:01.196 --> 00:06:02.856 A:middle
Next, we want to tear down any

00:06:02.856 --> 00:06:04.416 A:middle
UI that the user may have

00:06:04.416 --> 00:06:05.756 A:middle
navigated to in a previous

00:06:05.756 --> 00:06:06.506 A:middle
session with the app.

00:06:07.056 --> 00:06:07.966 A:middle
This app is built using a

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:09.696 A:middle
navigation controller, so all we

00:06:09.696 --> 00:06:10.846 A:middle
have to do is pop back to the

00:06:10.846 --> 00:06:12.386 A:middle
root view controller, which is

00:06:12.386 --> 00:06:13.296 A:middle
the app's main screen.

00:06:14.676 --> 00:06:16.346 A:middle
And now, we want to push a

00:06:16.346 --> 00:06:18.036 A:middle
detail controller for the URL

00:06:18.036 --> 00:06:18.986 A:middle
onto the nav stack.

00:06:19.606 --> 00:06:20.796 A:middle
We want to do this even if we're

00:06:20.796 --> 00:06:22.376 A:middle
ultimately handling the playURL,

00:06:22.846 --> 00:06:23.656 A:middle
and that way the detail

00:06:23.656 --> 00:06:24.786 A:middle
controller will be there if the

00:06:24.786 --> 00:06:25.976 A:middle
user menu's out of playback.

00:06:26.656 --> 00:06:27.466 A:middle
And we'll push the detail

00:06:27.466 --> 00:06:28.756 A:middle
controller by performing the

00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:30.186 A:middle
same segue that would be

00:06:30.186 --> 00:06:31.466 A:middle
triggered if the user selected

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:32.866 A:middle
one of the collection view cells

00:06:33.016 --> 00:06:34.026 A:middle
on the app's main screen.

00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:37.416 A:middle
Finally, if we're handling the

00:06:37.416 --> 00:06:39.046 A:middle
playURL, we want to push a

00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:40.746 A:middle
player view controller on top of

00:06:40.746 --> 00:06:41.776 A:middle
the detail view controller.

00:06:42.386 --> 00:06:43.546 A:middle
And we'll do this, again by

00:06:43.546 --> 00:06:44.816 A:middle
performing the same segue that

00:06:44.816 --> 00:06:46.236 A:middle
would be triggered if the user

00:06:46.236 --> 00:06:47.576 A:middle
had selected the Play button on

00:06:47.576 --> 00:06:48.296 A:middle
the detail screen.

00:06:50.876 --> 00:06:52.446 A:middle
In summary, deep links provide a

00:06:52.446 --> 00:06:53.886 A:middle
great way for users to quickly

00:06:53.886 --> 00:06:55.276 A:middle
navigate to content that may be

00:06:55.326 --> 00:06:56.166 A:middle
deep within your app.

00:06:56.686 --> 00:06:58.236 A:middle
When opening a deep link you'll

00:06:58.236 --> 00:06:59.596 A:middle
provide the best experience by

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.816 A:middle
taking the user to the linked

00:07:00.816 --> 00:07:02.256 A:middle
content immediately and

00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:02.916 A:middle
providing them with a

00:07:02.916 --> 00:07:04.076 A:middle
predictable way to get back.

00:07:05.976 --> 00:07:07.176 A:middle
