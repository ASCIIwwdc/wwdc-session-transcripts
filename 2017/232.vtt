00:00:24.986 --> 00:00:27.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello. Good evening,

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:28.506 A:middle
everyone.

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:30.116 A:middle
My name is Samantha Mravca.

00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:31.716 A:middle
And I am really excited to share

00:00:31.716 --> 00:00:32.986 A:middle
with all of you, today, what's

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:34.666 A:middle
new in ResearchKit and CareKit.

00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:38.546 A:middle
So, to start, as many of you

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:39.836 A:middle
know, ResearchKit is an

00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:41.126 A:middle
opensource framework that we

00:00:41.126 --> 00:00:42.726 A:middle
released in 2015.

00:00:42.946 --> 00:00:44.286 A:middle
And it was designed to tackle

00:00:44.286 --> 00:00:45.846 A:middle
common challenges in research,

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.806 A:middle
such as limited participation

00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:50.106 A:middle
and infrequent data, by enabling

00:00:50.106 --> 00:00:51.706 A:middle
both developers and researchers

00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:53.316 A:middle
to create and execute large

00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:55.266 A:middle
scale studies, using our iOS

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:55.756 A:middle
devices.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.386 A:middle
After the launch of ResearchKit,

00:00:58.386 --> 00:01:00.186 A:middle
our team focused their energy on

00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:01.736 A:middle
a more patient centric approach

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:02.226 A:middle
to health.

00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:03.366 A:middle
Which eventually led to the

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.166 A:middle
creation of ResearchKit's sister

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.026 A:middle
framework, CareKit.

00:01:07.286 --> 00:01:09.426 A:middle
CareKit was released in 2016 and

00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:10.916 A:middle
it was designed to empower

00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:12.316 A:middle
patients by enabling them to

00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:13.636 A:middle
take a more active role in their

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:14.046 A:middle
own care.

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:15.826 A:middle
And so, although these

00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:16.746 A:middle
frameworks were built with

00:01:16.746 --> 00:01:18.056 A:middle
different audiences in mind,

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:19.766 A:middle
they truly work together.

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.306 A:middle
Not only as sister frameworks,

00:01:21.426 --> 00:01:22.846 A:middle
but they were built to sit

00:01:22.846 --> 00:01:24.076 A:middle
beautifully on top of Apple's

00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:24.936 A:middle
HealthKit framework.

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:26.426 A:middle
That way, they can leverage and

00:01:26.426 --> 00:01:27.746 A:middle
share the rich health data from

00:01:27.746 --> 00:01:28.816 A:middle
other third-party apps and

00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:29.366 A:middle
devices.

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:31.856 A:middle
And so, by combining the power

00:01:31.856 --> 00:01:33.746 A:middle
of all three, you can create a

00:01:33.746 --> 00:01:35.216 A:middle
truly elevated experience for

00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:35.956 A:middle
your end user.

00:01:37.536 --> 00:01:38.946 A:middle
So, even just since last WWDC,

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:41.226 A:middle
we've seen lots more ResearchKit

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:42.816 A:middle
and CareKit apps pop up all over

00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:43.286 A:middle
the globe.

00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:45.266 A:middle
And so, quickly, before we jump

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:46.326 A:middle
into the rest of the talk, let's

00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:47.316 A:middle
just take a look at some of

00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:47.996 A:middle
these examples.

00:01:48.616 --> 00:01:51.386 A:middle
So, to start, in the U.K.

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:53.586 A:middle
MyAsthma is a ResearchKit app

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:54.796 A:middle
that helps patients better

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:55.786 A:middle
understand their asthma

00:01:55.786 --> 00:01:57.666 A:middle
triggers, as well as important

00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:58.516 A:middle
information about their

00:01:58.516 --> 00:02:00.126 A:middle
surrounding environment.

00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:03.096 A:middle
Over in Japan, Nestle Skin

00:02:03.096 --> 00:02:04.596 A:middle
Health recently released their

00:02:04.596 --> 00:02:06.506 A:middle
ResearchKit app to study common

00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:08.006 A:middle
skin conditions by using

00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:09.206 A:middle
accelerometer data from the

00:02:09.206 --> 00:02:10.826 A:middle
watch to detect scratching

00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:11.416 A:middle
during sleep.

00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:15.946 A:middle
And down in Australia, Professor

00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:17.296 A:middle
Timothy Skinner and his team

00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:18.896 A:middle
have developed a CareKit app

00:02:18.896 --> 00:02:21.376 A:middle
emojifit Diabetes, which makes

00:02:21.376 --> 00:02:23.456 A:middle
great use of emojis to convey

00:02:23.456 --> 00:02:25.016 A:middle
often overwhelming and confusing

00:02:25.016 --> 00:02:26.466 A:middle
medical information to patients

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:27.186 A:middle
trying to manage their

00:02:27.186 --> 00:02:27.756 A:middle
condition.

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:30.866 A:middle
And lastly, back in the U.S.,

00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:33.306 A:middle
PPD Act is a ResearchKit app

00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:35.186 A:middle
from the researchers at UNC

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:37.266 A:middle
Chapel Hill that is aimed to

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:38.576 A:middle
better understand the genetic

00:02:38.576 --> 00:02:40.286 A:middle
basis of postpartum depression.

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:43.206 A:middle
And Sharp Healthcare is working

00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:45.016 A:middle
on their CareKit app to help

00:02:45.016 --> 00:02:47.556 A:middle
their patients post eye surgery.

00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:49.236 A:middle
That way they can stick to their

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:50.826 A:middle
recovery plans in those crucial

00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:52.036 A:middle
weeks immediately following

00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:52.616 A:middle
their surgery.

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:55.316 A:middle
And so, these are just some of

00:02:55.316 --> 00:02:56.656 A:middle
the examples of the amazing

00:02:56.656 --> 00:02:57.946 A:middle
ResearchKit and CareKit apps

00:02:58.016 --> 00:02:59.496 A:middle
that we have seen launched over

00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:00.496 A:middle
the last few years.

00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:02.996 A:middle
And we are so excited to keep

00:03:02.996 --> 00:03:03.656 A:middle
seeing more.

00:03:03.956 --> 00:03:05.086 A:middle
But with that, let's go ahead

00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:06.016 A:middle
and jump into the rest of our

00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:06.356 A:middle
talk.

00:03:06.736 --> 00:03:08.596 A:middle
And we can start off by going

00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:10.366 A:middle
over the new features in both of

00:03:10.366 --> 00:03:11.536 A:middle
the CareKit and ResearchKit

00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:11.996 A:middle
frameworks.

00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:14.046 A:middle
After that, I'll invite up my

00:03:14.046 --> 00:03:15.356 A:middle
coworker, Srinath, who will

00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:17.376 A:middle
share a new CareKit prototyping

00:03:17.376 --> 00:03:18.386 A:middle
tool with all of you.

00:03:18.756 --> 00:03:20.186 A:middle
And then, once he's done, I'll

00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:21.536 A:middle
jump back up onstage and we can

00:03:21.536 --> 00:03:22.956 A:middle
talk about the community and our

00:03:22.956 --> 00:03:24.036 A:middle
collaboration together.

00:03:24.626 --> 00:03:26.326 A:middle
So, let's start with

00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:27.846 A:middle
ResearchKit, our new updates and

00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:28.256 A:middle
features.

00:03:28.326 --> 00:03:30.576 A:middle
And the first update we have for

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:32.336 A:middle
you is a small but powerful

00:03:32.336 --> 00:03:33.576 A:middle
change, that we made to the Tone

00:03:33.576 --> 00:03:34.566 A:middle
Audiometry task.

00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:36.786 A:middle
As many of you know, this Tone

00:03:36.786 --> 00:03:38.776 A:middle
Audiometry active test is a

00:03:38.776 --> 00:03:39.426 A:middle
hearing test.

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:41.566 A:middle
During which users are asked to

00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:42.986 A:middle
wear headphones and listen to a

00:03:42.986 --> 00:03:44.176 A:middle
series of different audio

00:03:44.176 --> 00:03:45.516 A:middle
frequencies, that can be

00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:46.686 A:middle
delivered to either the left or

00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:47.166 A:middle
right ear.

00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:49.416 A:middle
As users hear these frequencies,

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:50.836 A:middle
they will progressively increase

00:03:50.836 --> 00:03:52.766 A:middle
in volume until the user taps a

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:53.926 A:middle
button to indicate that they've

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:54.746 A:middle
heard the sound.

00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:57.236 A:middle
And in the old version, we just

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:58.656 A:middle
had one button for them to tap.

00:03:58.766 --> 00:04:00.746 A:middle
But now, we are including both a

00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:01.876 A:middle
left and right button.

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:03.226 A:middle
That way, not only can you

00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:04.286 A:middle
indicate when you've heard the

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:05.846 A:middle
tone, but you can also specify

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:07.776 A:middle
which ear you've heard it in.

00:04:09.036 --> 00:04:11.026 A:middle
So, next we have a brand new

00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:12.496 A:middle
active test developed by one of

00:04:12.496 --> 00:04:14.146 A:middle
our own Apple engineers, the

00:04:14.146 --> 00:04:14.786 A:middle
Stroop Test.

00:04:15.396 --> 00:04:16.626 A:middle
This test helps measure

00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:18.626 A:middle
selective attention by asking

00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:20.066 A:middle
participants to focus their

00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:21.526 A:middle
attention on one stimulus, while

00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:22.416 A:middle
ignoring another.

00:04:23.306 --> 00:04:24.786 A:middle
So, during this test, users will

00:04:24.786 --> 00:04:26.566 A:middle
see two possible combinations of

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:27.936 A:middle
text and tint appear on the

00:04:27.936 --> 00:04:28.996 A:middle
screen in front of them.

00:04:29.216 --> 00:04:30.206 A:middle
And these can be either

00:04:30.206 --> 00:04:32.356 A:middle
concordant or discordant.

00:04:32.896 --> 00:04:34.176 A:middle
And you can see on the screen

00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:36.096 A:middle
here, that we must ignore the

00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:37.646 A:middle
text and instead, select the

00:04:37.646 --> 00:04:38.996 A:middle
button that reflects the tint

00:04:38.996 --> 00:04:40.216 A:middle
color that we see displayed.

00:04:41.436 --> 00:04:43.296 A:middle
As users continue to complete

00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:44.766 A:middle
these attempts, a pass or fail

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.576 A:middle
will be recorded for each

00:04:46.576 --> 00:04:48.306 A:middle
attempt, as well as the time to

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:51.916 A:middle
complete the test.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:54.066 A:middle
So, next we have a contribution

00:04:54.066 --> 00:04:54.856 A:middle
from the community.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.206 A:middle
And I'd like to thank Faraz

00:04:56.206 --> 00:04:57.546 A:middle
Hussain, who is one of the By

00:04:57.546 --> 00:04:59.236 A:middle
Effect app developers from the

00:04:59.506 --> 00:05:00.876 A:middle
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

00:05:00.876 --> 00:05:02.216 A:middle
ResearchKit Mood Challenge.

00:05:02.696 --> 00:05:04.266 A:middle
He has contributed the Trail

00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:05.546 A:middle
Making Test, which is a

00:05:05.546 --> 00:05:07.206 A:middle
neuropsychological test of

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:08.666 A:middle
visual attention and task

00:05:08.786 --> 00:05:09.246 A:middle
switching.

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:11.336 A:middle
And during this test, users must

00:05:11.646 --> 00:05:13.456 A:middle
connect a series of labeled

00:05:13.456 --> 00:05:14.726 A:middle
circles, as you see here, on the

00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:17.996 A:middle
screen, from one A, two B, three

00:05:17.996 --> 00:05:18.816 A:middle
C, and so on.

00:05:18.816 --> 00:05:19.896 A:middle
And then, the time to complete

00:05:19.896 --> 00:05:21.176 A:middle
this test will be recorded.

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:25.856 A:middle
And the last active task we have

00:05:25.856 --> 00:05:27.426 A:middle
is the new Range of Motion

00:05:27.486 --> 00:05:28.166 A:middle
Active Task.

00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:30.236 A:middle
And a big thanks goes to Doctor

00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:32.106 A:middle
Raj Karia, John Guydo, and

00:05:32.176 --> 00:05:34.076 A:middle
Darren Levy for contributing the

00:05:34.076 --> 00:05:36.176 A:middle
Range of Motion Active Task.

00:05:36.176 --> 00:05:37.396 A:middle
This lets you measure both

00:05:37.476 --> 00:05:39.536 A:middle
flexed and extended positions.

00:05:39.996 --> 00:05:41.946 A:middle
And from the beginning, users

00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:43.156 A:middle
will be asked to place their

00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:44.576 A:middle
device in the proper location.

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:46.296 A:middle
And then, using a touch anywhere

00:05:46.386 --> 00:05:48.306 A:middle
active task, they can simply tap

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:49.376 A:middle
the screen to indicate that

00:05:49.376 --> 00:05:50.526 A:middle
they're ready to proceed with

00:05:50.526 --> 00:05:52.136 A:middle
the rest of the steps.

00:05:52.616 --> 00:05:53.776 A:middle
And so, as they continue to

00:05:53.776 --> 00:05:55.106 A:middle
follow the steps in this test,

00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:56.206 A:middle
recordings from both the

00:05:56.206 --> 00:05:57.966 A:middle
accelerometer and the gyroscope

00:05:57.966 --> 00:05:58.776 A:middle
will be recorded.

00:05:59.266 --> 00:06:00.656 A:middle
And what's even more, is not

00:06:00.656 --> 00:06:01.916 A:middle
only did they contribute this

00:06:01.916 --> 00:06:02.876 A:middle
for the shoulder.

00:06:02.876 --> 00:06:04.096 A:middle
But they contributed another

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:05.476 A:middle
version with the company assets

00:06:05.556 --> 00:06:06.736 A:middle
for the knee, as well.

00:06:07.306 --> 00:06:10.576 A:middle
And so, lastly, I'd like to

00:06:10.656 --> 00:06:11.836 A:middle
highlight a new video

00:06:11.836 --> 00:06:13.036 A:middle
instruction step for

00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:13.596 A:middle
ResearchKit.

00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:15.646 A:middle
This was contributed by Oliver

00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:16.096 A:middle
Shcaefer.

00:06:16.096 --> 00:06:17.016 A:middle
So, thank you, Oliver.

00:06:17.526 --> 00:06:19.116 A:middle
And this step makes it really

00:06:19.116 --> 00:06:20.456 A:middle
easy, now, for you to display

00:06:20.456 --> 00:06:22.056 A:middle
video content within your apps,

00:06:22.056 --> 00:06:23.416 A:middle
from either a remote or local

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:23.756 A:middle
source.

00:06:24.456 --> 00:06:27.306 A:middle
And so, with that, you have the

00:06:27.306 --> 00:06:28.536 A:middle
latest updates and features to

00:06:28.536 --> 00:06:29.766 A:middle
ResearchKit, including several

00:06:29.766 --> 00:06:30.616 A:middle
contributions from the

00:06:30.616 --> 00:06:31.146 A:middle
community.

00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:32.656 A:middle
And additionally, we will also,

00:06:32.656 --> 00:06:34.406 A:middle
now be assigning a visual object

00:06:34.406 --> 00:06:35.886 A:middle
identifier to the ResearchKit

00:06:35.886 --> 00:06:36.656 A:middle
repository.

00:06:36.966 --> 00:06:38.186 A:middle
That way, as you all bring the

00:06:38.186 --> 00:06:39.746 A:middle
results of these studies to the

00:06:39.746 --> 00:06:41.376 A:middle
academic community, you can now

00:06:41.376 --> 00:06:42.696 A:middle
reference the framework using

00:06:42.696 --> 00:06:43.496 A:middle
this unique string.

00:06:44.106 --> 00:06:48.046 A:middle
So, with that, I would like to

00:06:48.046 --> 00:06:50.196 A:middle
go ahead and jump into CareKit.

00:06:50.606 --> 00:06:51.696 A:middle
So, as you know it today,

00:06:52.066 --> 00:06:53.586 A:middle
CareKit consists of four core

00:06:53.586 --> 00:06:54.086 A:middle
modules.

00:06:54.516 --> 00:06:57.526 A:middle
A Care Card, a Symptom Tracker,

00:06:58.246 --> 00:07:00.316 A:middle
an Insights module, as well as a

00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:01.206 A:middle
Connect module.

00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:03.256 A:middle
And so, today, the Care Card

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.656 A:middle
lets patients view all of their

00:07:04.656 --> 00:07:05.936 A:middle
daily interventions.

00:07:05.936 --> 00:07:07.716 A:middle
These are things like completing

00:07:07.716 --> 00:07:09.136 A:middle
medication or stretches.

00:07:09.646 --> 00:07:11.396 A:middle
And the Symptom Tracker lets

00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:12.926 A:middle
patients view all of their

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:14.516 A:middle
subjective or objective

00:07:14.516 --> 00:07:16.056 A:middle
measurements that they track.

00:07:16.056 --> 00:07:17.026 A:middle
And these could be things like

00:07:17.026 --> 00:07:17.926 A:middle
tracking weight and blood

00:07:17.926 --> 00:07:19.346 A:middle
pressure, or mood and pain

00:07:19.346 --> 00:07:19.726 A:middle
scores.

00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:21.796 A:middle
And so, over the last year we

00:07:21.796 --> 00:07:23.496 A:middle
have heard feedback that many

00:07:23.496 --> 00:07:24.746 A:middle
patients would like to see all

00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:25.956 A:middle
of their activities, both

00:07:25.956 --> 00:07:27.196 A:middle
interventions and assessments,

00:07:27.406 --> 00:07:28.156 A:middle
in one view.

00:07:28.836 --> 00:07:30.136 A:middle
And so, to support that feedback

00:07:30.386 --> 00:07:31.776 A:middle
our team has created what we are

00:07:31.776 --> 00:07:33.586 A:middle
calling our Care Contents view.

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:35.276 A:middle
Which lets you combine all of

00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:36.566 A:middle
those activities and see them in

00:07:36.566 --> 00:07:37.276 A:middle
one tab.

00:07:38.356 --> 00:07:39.446 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and take a

00:07:39.446 --> 00:07:40.716 A:middle
look at this new Care Contents

00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:41.016 A:middle
view.

00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:42.646 A:middle
And you'll see in my example

00:07:42.646 --> 00:07:44.376 A:middle
CareKit app that I've set up to

00:07:44.376 --> 00:07:46.166 A:middle
help manage my migraines, we can

00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:47.466 A:middle
see all of my activities, here.

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:48.436 A:middle
And they all contribute to the

00:07:48.486 --> 00:07:49.616 A:middle
same completion score at the

00:07:49.616 --> 00:07:49.916 A:middle
top.

00:07:49.916 --> 00:07:51.936 A:middle
But let's go ahead and jump into

00:07:52.016 --> 00:07:53.556 A:middle
this and dig in, piece by piece.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:54.476 A:middle
Because we have lots of other

00:07:54.476 --> 00:07:55.486 A:middle
updates to share, as well.

00:07:55.696 --> 00:07:58.186 A:middle
And you'll see here, at the top,

00:07:58.236 --> 00:07:59.856 A:middle
we have a new header view with

00:07:59.856 --> 00:08:01.496 A:middle
lots of UI updates, including

00:08:01.496 --> 00:08:02.726 A:middle
this new ring view, to show

00:08:02.726 --> 00:08:03.376 A:middle
completion.

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:05.046 A:middle
As well as the new heart icon in

00:08:05.046 --> 00:08:05.666 A:middle
the center.

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:07.826 A:middle
As users complete their

00:08:07.826 --> 00:08:09.276 A:middle
activities for the day, this

00:08:09.276 --> 00:08:10.306 A:middle
ring will fill up.

00:08:10.306 --> 00:08:11.806 A:middle
And once they reach 100%

00:08:11.806 --> 00:08:13.476 A:middle
completion, the circle will fill

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:15.076 A:middle
in and a star badge will appear

00:08:15.076 --> 00:08:16.576 A:middle
in its place, which you can see

00:08:16.576 --> 00:08:17.576 A:middle
in the week view at the top.

00:08:17.576 --> 00:08:19.316 A:middle
And this lets user quickly

00:08:19.316 --> 00:08:21.376 A:middle
glance and have an idea for 100%

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:22.346 A:middle
compliance days.

00:08:23.256 --> 00:08:24.566 A:middle
And what's even more exciting,

00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:25.866 A:middle
is that this new heart icon you

00:08:25.866 --> 00:08:27.896 A:middle
see in the center is just one of

00:08:28.026 --> 00:08:30.566 A:middle
28 icons designed by Apple's own

00:08:30.566 --> 00:08:31.206 A:middle
HI team.

00:08:31.586 --> 00:08:32.996 A:middle
And you can now, leverage these

00:08:32.996 --> 00:08:34.406 A:middle
glyphs and icons within your own

00:08:34.406 --> 00:08:35.126 A:middle
CareKit apps.

00:08:35.576 --> 00:08:36.886 A:middle
And not only will they display

00:08:36.886 --> 00:08:38.026 A:middle
beautifully on the patient app

00:08:38.026 --> 00:08:39.436 A:middle
that you just saw, but they'll

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:40.796 A:middle
also appear beautifully as a

00:08:40.796 --> 00:08:41.986 A:middle
complication on the watch.

00:08:42.036 --> 00:08:43.516 A:middle
That way patients can quickly

00:08:43.586 --> 00:08:44.986 A:middle
glance at their daily progress

00:08:44.986 --> 00:08:46.936 A:middle
for the day.

00:08:47.116 --> 00:08:48.716 A:middle
And so, using these new glyphs

00:08:48.716 --> 00:08:49.926 A:middle
is really straightforward.

00:08:49.926 --> 00:08:51.486 A:middle
All you need to do is just set

00:08:51.486 --> 00:08:52.696 A:middle
the glyph properties within the

00:08:52.696 --> 00:08:54.166 A:middle
view controller, and then your

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:55.866 A:middle
desired icon will display upon

00:08:55.866 --> 00:08:57.196 A:middle
navigating back to your Care

00:08:57.196 --> 00:08:57.966 A:middle
Contents view.

00:08:58.516 --> 00:09:01.006 A:middle
If we zoom out and we look at

00:09:01.006 --> 00:09:02.426 A:middle
the rest of my Care Contents

00:09:02.426 --> 00:09:03.696 A:middle
tab, you'll see at the top,

00:09:03.696 --> 00:09:05.346 A:middle
here, my three intervention

00:09:05.346 --> 00:09:06.466 A:middle
activities for the day.

00:09:06.466 --> 00:09:07.976 A:middle
Of which I've already completed

00:09:07.976 --> 00:09:09.196 A:middle
several, including two of my

00:09:09.196 --> 00:09:10.396 A:middle
breathing exercises from my

00:09:10.396 --> 00:09:10.706 A:middle
watch.

00:09:10.706 --> 00:09:12.356 A:middle
I probably should have done

00:09:12.396 --> 00:09:13.306 A:middle
another one.

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.486 A:middle
But we'll go ahead and scroll

00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:17.156 A:middle
down, and we'll see that we also

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:18.466 A:middle
have my two assessments.

00:09:19.236 --> 00:09:21.016 A:middle
My two assessments for sleep and

00:09:21.016 --> 00:09:21.236 A:middle
stress.

00:09:22.076 --> 00:09:23.896 A:middle
My sleep data is coming directly

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:25.386 A:middle
from HealthKit, that way I don't

00:09:25.386 --> 00:09:27.366 A:middle
need to do any additional entry

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:28.096 A:middle
on my part.

00:09:28.486 --> 00:09:29.796 A:middle
And then, my stress survey, I

00:09:29.796 --> 00:09:31.096 A:middle
can quickly fill out using a

00:09:31.096 --> 00:09:31.856 A:middle
ResearchKit survey.

00:09:31.856 --> 00:09:33.556 A:middle
And unfortunately, you notice

00:09:33.556 --> 00:09:34.506 A:middle
that I did not get much sleep

00:09:34.506 --> 00:09:35.626 A:middle
last night, and I was a bit

00:09:35.626 --> 00:09:36.936 A:middle
stressed when I took my survey.

00:09:37.306 --> 00:09:38.526 A:middle
I think if I took that survey an

00:09:38.526 --> 00:09:39.746 A:middle
hour ago, it probably would have

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:40.226 A:middle
been ten.

00:09:40.656 --> 00:09:41.856 A:middle
But let's go ahead and scroll

00:09:41.856 --> 00:09:43.056 A:middle
down, and look at the rest of my

00:09:43.056 --> 00:09:43.996 A:middle
Care Contents view.

00:09:44.496 --> 00:09:45.596 A:middle
And you'll notice that we've

00:09:45.596 --> 00:09:47.076 A:middle
made a few other updates, here.

00:09:47.716 --> 00:09:49.906 A:middle
The first one lets you now tag

00:09:49.906 --> 00:09:51.336 A:middle
activities as optional.

00:09:51.766 --> 00:09:52.856 A:middle
And so, this means that these

00:09:52.856 --> 00:09:54.256 A:middle
activities will not contribute

00:09:54.256 --> 00:09:55.366 A:middle
to your daily completion score,

00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:55.896 A:middle
at the top.

00:09:56.806 --> 00:09:58.206 A:middle
So, as you can see here, it's

00:09:58.206 --> 00:09:59.436 A:middle
great for take-as-needed

00:09:59.436 --> 00:10:01.226 A:middle
medications, like my ibuprofen,

00:10:01.496 --> 00:10:02.906 A:middle
that we don't actually require

00:10:02.906 --> 00:10:04.406 A:middle
for the patient to take as part

00:10:04.406 --> 00:10:04.926 A:middle
of their care plan.

00:10:06.026 --> 00:10:08.436 A:middle
Right below that, you'll see

00:10:08.436 --> 00:10:09.816 A:middle
another new activity that we

00:10:09.816 --> 00:10:11.336 A:middle
have, which is a new Read Only

00:10:11.336 --> 00:10:11.986 A:middle
activity.

00:10:12.456 --> 00:10:13.756 A:middle
And this lets you now, just

00:10:13.756 --> 00:10:15.466 A:middle
display informational text to

00:10:15.466 --> 00:10:16.986 A:middle
the user, that actually doesn't

00:10:16.986 --> 00:10:18.386 A:middle
require any action on their

00:10:18.386 --> 00:10:18.686 A:middle
part.

00:10:18.726 --> 00:10:21.656 A:middle
So, let's go ahead and take a

00:10:21.656 --> 00:10:22.796 A:middle
look at how we can create these

00:10:22.796 --> 00:10:23.976 A:middle
new optional and Read Only

00:10:23.976 --> 00:10:24.566 A:middle
activities.

00:10:26.056 --> 00:10:27.796 A:middle
As you can see, here, our team

00:10:27.796 --> 00:10:29.526 A:middle
has created a brand new Boolean

00:10:29.736 --> 00:10:31.176 A:middle
parameter, specifically for

00:10:31.176 --> 00:10:31.936 A:middle
optionality.

00:10:32.216 --> 00:10:33.236 A:middle
And as you saw on the Care

00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:34.456 A:middle
Contents view, by setting that

00:10:34.456 --> 00:10:35.786 A:middle
to true, it will prevent my

00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:37.186 A:middle
ibuprofen from actually

00:10:37.316 --> 00:10:38.336 A:middle
contributing to my daily

00:10:38.336 --> 00:10:39.226 A:middle
completion score.

00:10:39.776 --> 00:10:42.726 A:middle
We also, took a look at the new

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:44.456 A:middle
Read Only activities to display

00:10:44.456 --> 00:10:45.636 A:middle
information to the user.

00:10:46.206 --> 00:10:47.486 A:middle
And you'll also notice that we

00:10:47.486 --> 00:10:48.766 A:middle
created a new Read Only

00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:49.606 A:middle
initializer.

00:10:49.886 --> 00:10:51.176 A:middle
Which this will allow you to

00:10:51.176 --> 00:10:52.426 A:middle
now, create these activities the

00:10:52.476 --> 00:10:53.546 A:middle
same as you would any other

00:10:53.546 --> 00:10:54.316 A:middle
activity type.

00:10:55.026 --> 00:10:57.996 A:middle
And so, there you have our new

00:10:57.996 --> 00:10:59.656 A:middle
combined view, that we're

00:10:59.656 --> 00:11:01.006 A:middle
calling Care Contents, with all

00:11:01.006 --> 00:11:02.006 A:middle
of your activities,

00:11:02.006 --> 00:11:03.306 A:middle
interventions, and assessments

00:11:03.306 --> 00:11:03.896 A:middle
on the same tab.

00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:05.316 A:middle
As well as some new other

00:11:05.316 --> 00:11:06.486 A:middle
activities that we just saw.

00:11:07.336 --> 00:11:08.926 A:middle
And so, with that, I'd like to

00:11:08.926 --> 00:11:10.786 A:middle
now jump into a new topic and

00:11:10.786 --> 00:11:13.336 A:middle
introduce you to a brand new API

00:11:13.336 --> 00:11:14.476 A:middle
that we have built this year, to

00:11:14.476 --> 00:11:15.336 A:middle
support thresholds.

00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:18.126 A:middle
So, this new API will let

00:11:18.306 --> 00:11:20.046 A:middle
developers set and track two

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:21.206 A:middle
different threshold types,

00:11:21.676 --> 00:11:23.586 A:middle
adherence or numeric, which you

00:11:23.586 --> 00:11:24.936 A:middle
can link to specific Care Plan

00:11:24.936 --> 00:11:25.546 A:middle
activities.

00:11:26.616 --> 00:11:27.636 A:middle
And so, let's look at how we can

00:11:27.636 --> 00:11:28.466 A:middle
create these thresholds in the

00:11:28.466 --> 00:11:28.796 A:middle
code.

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:30.286 A:middle
And you'll see it's pretty

00:11:30.286 --> 00:11:31.186 A:middle
straightforward, again.

00:11:31.676 --> 00:11:33.036 A:middle
Just depending on which type of

00:11:33.036 --> 00:11:34.146 A:middle
threshold you want to use.

00:11:34.146 --> 00:11:35.146 A:middle
You just need to make sure that

00:11:35.146 --> 00:11:36.296 A:middle
you're using the corresponding

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:37.246 A:middle
initializer type.

00:11:38.276 --> 00:11:39.796 A:middle
So, while numeric thresholds can

00:11:39.796 --> 00:11:41.356 A:middle
only be applied to assessments,

00:11:42.046 --> 00:11:43.236 A:middle
adherence thresholds can be

00:11:43.236 --> 00:11:44.956 A:middle
applied to both assessments and

00:11:44.956 --> 00:11:45.676 A:middle
interventions.

00:11:46.476 --> 00:11:47.866 A:middle
And once you've gone ahead and

00:11:48.076 --> 00:11:49.196 A:middle
created those thresholds, you

00:11:49.196 --> 00:11:50.556 A:middle
can then use them to perform any

00:11:50.556 --> 00:11:51.726 A:middle
custom logic you want.

00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:53.626 A:middle
The Care Plan store is going to

00:11:53.626 --> 00:11:55.256 A:middle
automatically notify you any

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:56.596 A:middle
time one of these new thresholds

00:11:56.596 --> 00:11:57.446 A:middle
has been invoked.

00:11:57.786 --> 00:11:59.046 A:middle
And so, to support this new

00:11:59.046 --> 00:12:00.836 A:middle
capability, our team has gone

00:12:00.936 --> 00:12:02.626 A:middle
ahead and made a few updates to

00:12:02.626 --> 00:12:03.656 A:middle
the Insights tab.

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:04.906 A:middle
That way we could leverage these

00:12:04.906 --> 00:12:05.996 A:middle
thresholds and display them in a

00:12:05.996 --> 00:12:06.456 A:middle
nice way.

00:12:06.456 --> 00:12:09.616 A:middle
So, here at the top, you'll see

00:12:09.616 --> 00:12:11.386 A:middle
a brand new widgets view.

00:12:11.776 --> 00:12:13.466 A:middle
And this lets you display up to

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:14.826 A:middle
three widgets for you to now,

00:12:14.956 --> 00:12:16.296 A:middle
highlight key values to your

00:12:16.296 --> 00:12:16.836 A:middle
patients.

00:12:17.986 --> 00:12:19.126 A:middle
What's even more, is you can

00:12:19.126 --> 00:12:20.586 A:middle
link these widgets to a Care

00:12:20.586 --> 00:12:21.566 A:middle
Plan activity.

00:12:21.566 --> 00:12:22.466 A:middle
And then, you don't need to do

00:12:22.466 --> 00:12:23.366 A:middle
any additional work.

00:12:23.366 --> 00:12:25.156 A:middle
And all of the values and widget

00:12:25.156 --> 00:12:26.916 A:middle
colors can update automatically,

00:12:26.916 --> 00:12:28.676 A:middle
based on the most recent data

00:12:28.676 --> 00:12:29.686 A:middle
inputs, as well as the

00:12:29.686 --> 00:12:30.686 A:middle
thresholds that you've already

00:12:30.686 --> 00:12:30.896 A:middle
set.

00:12:32.146 --> 00:12:33.266 A:middle
So, let's take a look at how we

00:12:33.266 --> 00:12:34.186 A:middle
can create these widgets.

00:12:34.456 --> 00:12:35.686 A:middle
And we'll start by checking out

00:12:35.686 --> 00:12:37.336 A:middle
my Stress Assessment that we saw

00:12:37.336 --> 00:12:38.646 A:middle
from my Care Contents view.

00:12:38.646 --> 00:12:40.306 A:middle
So, here we have my Stress

00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:40.776 A:middle
Assessment.

00:12:40.776 --> 00:12:42.186 A:middle
And we'll see that the first

00:12:42.186 --> 00:12:43.496 A:middle
method for creating widgets

00:12:43.766 --> 00:12:45.256 A:middle
actually handles all of the data

00:12:45.256 --> 00:12:46.636 A:middle
fetching and updating for me.

00:12:47.036 --> 00:12:48.626 A:middle
All we need to do is just link

00:12:48.626 --> 00:12:50.206 A:middle
it to the Activity identifier

00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:51.756 A:middle
that we want to display, and the

00:12:51.756 --> 00:12:52.726 A:middle
rest will happen behind the

00:12:52.726 --> 00:12:53.076 A:middle
scenes.

00:12:55.156 --> 00:12:56.956 A:middle
The second method for creating

00:12:56.956 --> 00:12:58.356 A:middle
widgets allows for a little bit

00:12:58.356 --> 00:12:59.656 A:middle
more customization.

00:13:00.056 --> 00:13:02.366 A:middle
You can specify exactly what you

00:13:02.726 --> 00:13:04.306 A:middle
want to display, by just using

00:13:04.306 --> 00:13:05.796 A:middle
the title and text parameters,

00:13:05.796 --> 00:13:06.506 A:middle
as you see, here.

00:13:07.066 --> 00:13:09.106 A:middle
And so then, once you've gone

00:13:09.106 --> 00:13:10.556 A:middle
ahead and created these widgets,

00:13:10.926 --> 00:13:12.266 A:middle
it's then, really easy to pass

00:13:12.266 --> 00:13:13.296 A:middle
them into the view controller

00:13:13.296 --> 00:13:14.606 A:middle
you saw, by using our new

00:13:14.606 --> 00:13:15.706 A:middle
patientWidgets parameter.

00:13:15.706 --> 00:13:17.636 A:middle
And this will help ensure that

00:13:17.636 --> 00:13:19.196 A:middle
your desired widgets will appear

00:13:19.196 --> 00:13:20.386 A:middle
when you navigate back to your

00:13:20.386 --> 00:13:21.686 A:middle
Insights tab.

00:13:22.356 --> 00:13:24.416 A:middle
So additionally, some thresholds

00:13:24.416 --> 00:13:26.276 A:middle
might require additional text or

00:13:26.276 --> 00:13:27.326 A:middle
information that you want to

00:13:27.326 --> 00:13:28.096 A:middle
give the user.

00:13:28.496 --> 00:13:29.526 A:middle
And so, we've created this

00:13:29.566 --> 00:13:30.836 A:middle
separate section, below, for

00:13:30.836 --> 00:13:31.676 A:middle
threshold alerts.

00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:32.976 A:middle
That way, you can create

00:13:32.976 --> 00:13:34.126 A:middle
messages for specific

00:13:34.126 --> 00:13:34.756 A:middle
activities.

00:13:35.056 --> 00:13:36.646 A:middle
And this will be evaluated the

00:13:36.716 --> 00:13:38.176 A:middle
same as the widgets above, and

00:13:38.176 --> 00:13:40.066 A:middle
automatically display if one of

00:13:40.066 --> 00:13:41.026 A:middle
those thresholds has been

00:13:41.026 --> 00:13:41.406 A:middle
invoked.

00:13:41.856 --> 00:13:44.436 A:middle
And so, there you have our

00:13:44.436 --> 00:13:45.876 A:middle
Insights tab, which we've

00:13:45.876 --> 00:13:47.366 A:middle
updated to really leverage these

00:13:47.366 --> 00:13:48.886 A:middle
new threshold APIs that we've

00:13:48.886 --> 00:13:49.096 A:middle
built.

00:13:49.576 --> 00:13:50.766 A:middle
And let's go ahead and jump into

00:13:50.766 --> 00:13:52.696 A:middle
our last tab for CareKit, which

00:13:52.696 --> 00:13:53.066 A:middle
is Connect.

00:13:54.206 --> 00:13:55.316 A:middle
You'll notice a lot of the same

00:13:55.316 --> 00:13:56.816 A:middle
features, here, including our

00:13:56.816 --> 00:13:58.566 A:middle
Profile header view, as well as

00:13:58.566 --> 00:13:59.556 A:middle
your care team members and

00:13:59.556 --> 00:14:00.356 A:middle
contact cards.

00:14:00.776 --> 00:14:02.116 A:middle
But you'll also notice this new

00:14:02.116 --> 00:14:02.996 A:middle
inbox feature.

00:14:03.436 --> 00:14:05.046 A:middle
And if we tap into that, it will

00:14:05.046 --> 00:14:06.676 A:middle
take me to my messaging screen

00:14:06.676 --> 00:14:07.766 A:middle
with my care team member.

00:14:08.346 --> 00:14:09.886 A:middle
So, our team has gone ahead and

00:14:09.886 --> 00:14:11.566 A:middle
built the UI that will allow

00:14:11.566 --> 00:14:12.906 A:middle
developers who want to take

00:14:12.906 --> 00:14:14.556 A:middle
Connect one step further, by

00:14:14.556 --> 00:14:15.876 A:middle
connecting their patients to

00:14:15.876 --> 00:14:17.046 A:middle
their care teams directly

00:14:17.046 --> 00:14:17.826 A:middle
through messaging.

00:14:18.386 --> 00:14:22.146 A:middle
So, there you have CareKit.

00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:25.136 A:middle
And we've made lots of update,

00:14:25.136 --> 00:14:26.536 A:middle
including our brand new combined

00:14:26.536 --> 00:14:29.236 A:middle
view, as well as UI and features

00:14:29.236 --> 00:14:30.446 A:middle
across all of our tabs.

00:14:30.836 --> 00:14:32.816 A:middle
And additionally, we are also

00:14:32.816 --> 00:14:34.346 A:middle
announcing a new bridge API for

00:14:34.346 --> 00:14:36.576 A:middle
CareKit, that will allow you to

00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:37.876 A:middle
now synch this data with

00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:39.126 A:middle
compatible HIPAA compliant

00:14:39.126 --> 00:14:39.706 A:middle
backends.

00:14:40.066 --> 00:14:41.296 A:middle
And to learn more about that, I

00:14:41.296 --> 00:14:42.406 A:middle
highly recommend going to

00:14:42.406 --> 00:14:43.596 A:middle
tomorrow's talk, hosted by

00:14:43.596 --> 00:14:45.456 A:middle
Kelsey Dedoshka, on Connecting

00:14:45.456 --> 00:14:46.266 A:middle
CareKit to the Cloud.

00:14:46.796 --> 00:14:50.126 A:middle
So, up until this point, we have

00:14:50.126 --> 00:14:51.356 A:middle
focused a lot of our attention

00:14:51.356 --> 00:14:52.676 A:middle
on the developer community.

00:14:52.966 --> 00:14:54.636 A:middle
But we understand that CareKit

00:14:54.926 --> 00:14:56.656 A:middle
has a much wider audience that's

00:14:56.656 --> 00:14:57.796 A:middle
interested in this framework.

00:14:57.796 --> 00:14:59.646 A:middle
And that is namely those of you

00:14:59.646 --> 00:15:01.186 A:middle
in the medical profession, as

00:15:01.186 --> 00:15:02.166 A:middle
well as those of you in

00:15:02.166 --> 00:15:02.706 A:middle
academia.

00:15:03.326 --> 00:15:05.226 A:middle
So, I'm really excited to say

00:15:05.226 --> 00:15:06.806 A:middle
that this year, we are releasing

00:15:06.806 --> 00:15:08.406 A:middle
a new tool for nontechnical

00:15:08.406 --> 00:15:08.836 A:middle
audience.

00:15:09.276 --> 00:15:10.556 A:middle
And to talk more about that, I

00:15:10.556 --> 00:15:11.566 A:middle
will invite my coworker,

00:15:11.566 --> 00:15:12.676 A:middle
Srinath, up to the stage.

00:15:14.716 --> 00:15:15.676 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Sam.

00:15:16.516 --> 00:15:17.186 A:middle
Hello, everybody.

00:15:17.626 --> 00:15:18.736 A:middle
My name is Srinath.

00:15:19.026 --> 00:15:20.166 A:middle
I'm a software engineer at

00:15:20.166 --> 00:15:20.536 A:middle
Apple.

00:15:20.536 --> 00:15:22.496 A:middle
And today, I'm here to talk to

00:15:22.496 --> 00:15:23.826 A:middle
you about the CareKit

00:15:23.826 --> 00:15:24.656 A:middle
Prototyping Tool.

00:15:25.606 --> 00:15:27.086 A:middle
Developing Healthcare centric

00:15:27.086 --> 00:15:28.846 A:middle
apps comes with its own set of

00:15:28.906 --> 00:15:30.666 A:middle
challenges, as many of you might

00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:31.576 A:middle
have experienced.

00:15:32.006 --> 00:15:33.876 A:middle
But the most interesting one is

00:15:33.876 --> 00:15:35.456 A:middle
that it requires a lot of

00:15:35.536 --> 00:15:38.126 A:middle
collaboration between the deeply

00:15:38.126 --> 00:15:39.016 A:middle
knowledgeable healthcare

00:15:39.016 --> 00:15:41.326 A:middle
community and the amazing app

00:15:41.326 --> 00:15:41.956 A:middle
developers.

00:15:42.626 --> 00:15:45.756 A:middle
Now let's say, for example, that

00:15:45.756 --> 00:15:48.146 A:middle
I am a physician and I'm really

00:15:48.146 --> 00:15:49.966 A:middle
interested in exploring the

00:15:49.966 --> 00:15:52.656 A:middle
possibility of taking a post

00:15:52.656 --> 00:15:54.786 A:middle
discharge treatment plan, which

00:15:54.786 --> 00:15:56.696 A:middle
I conventionally hand out to my

00:15:56.906 --> 00:15:58.596 A:middle
patients as a piece of paper.

00:15:59.146 --> 00:16:01.346 A:middle
And somewhat digitizing it, by

00:16:01.346 --> 00:16:03.436 A:middle
converting it into an app that

00:16:03.436 --> 00:16:05.386 A:middle
is easy to use and which would

00:16:05.386 --> 00:16:07.836 A:middle
also allow my patients to track

00:16:08.066 --> 00:16:09.916 A:middle
their medications and adherence

00:16:10.146 --> 00:16:11.536 A:middle
on a day to day basis.

00:16:12.066 --> 00:16:14.226 A:middle
Which is crucial for their

00:16:14.226 --> 00:16:15.306 A:middle
successful recovery.

00:16:15.806 --> 00:16:18.336 A:middle
Now, this sounds like an amazing

00:16:18.336 --> 00:16:20.626 A:middle
idea and I'd love to pitch this

00:16:20.626 --> 00:16:21.466 A:middle
to my department.

00:16:21.996 --> 00:16:23.796 A:middle
But before I can do that, there

00:16:23.796 --> 00:16:25.496 A:middle
are a few things which I need to

00:16:25.496 --> 00:16:26.526 A:middle
do on my own.

00:16:27.326 --> 00:16:30.076 A:middle
First, I try to explore what

00:16:30.076 --> 00:16:32.186 A:middle
technology is already available,

00:16:32.186 --> 00:16:33.656 A:middle
out there, that can help me

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:34.736 A:middle
achieve this goal.

00:16:35.556 --> 00:16:37.746 A:middle
Then, I move on to creating some

00:16:37.746 --> 00:16:40.156 A:middle
sort of rough sketches in order

00:16:40.156 --> 00:16:41.836 A:middle
to visually represent to other

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:44.496 A:middle
people what exactly I have in my

00:16:44.496 --> 00:16:44.896 A:middle
mind.

00:16:45.266 --> 00:16:48.676 A:middle
And then, finally, I feel that

00:16:48.676 --> 00:16:50.626 A:middle
I'm well prepared to take this

00:16:50.626 --> 00:16:52.026 A:middle
idea to my department.

00:16:52.496 --> 00:16:54.276 A:middle
And if, and only if, they

00:16:54.276 --> 00:16:56.566 A:middle
approve it do I get to hire the

00:16:56.566 --> 00:16:58.716 A:middle
necessary resources to get

00:16:58.716 --> 00:17:00.726 A:middle
started on developing the actual

00:17:02.106 --> 00:17:02.186 A:middle
app.

00:17:02.456 --> 00:17:03.346 A:middle
Now, switching back to my

00:17:03.346 --> 00:17:05.806 A:middle
developer mode, it's interesting

00:17:05.806 --> 00:17:07.506 A:middle
to note that the initial few

00:17:07.506 --> 00:17:09.396 A:middle
steps of this process is

00:17:09.396 --> 00:17:11.206 A:middle
typically handled by someone who

00:17:11.206 --> 00:17:13.026 A:middle
has little or no experience with

00:17:13.086 --> 00:17:14.206 A:middle
iOS app development.

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:16.546 A:middle
Ever since we announced the

00:17:16.546 --> 00:17:18.636 A:middle
CareKit framework, in 2016,

00:17:19.236 --> 00:17:21.156 A:middle
we've received a ton of requests

00:17:21.496 --> 00:17:22.706 A:middle
from healthcare professionals

00:17:22.886 --> 00:17:24.676 A:middle
and people in academia.

00:17:25.216 --> 00:17:27.376 A:middle
Inquiring about nontechnical

00:17:27.376 --> 00:17:29.206 A:middle
resources that can help them

00:17:29.476 --> 00:17:30.786 A:middle
better understand the

00:17:30.786 --> 00:17:32.506 A:middle
capabilities of the CareKit

00:17:32.506 --> 00:17:33.046 A:middle
framework.

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:36.366 A:middle
This is when we realized that

00:17:36.366 --> 00:17:38.526 A:middle
there seems to be a barrier for

00:17:38.526 --> 00:17:40.086 A:middle
entry for our nontechnical

00:17:40.086 --> 00:17:40.596 A:middle
audience.

00:17:40.886 --> 00:17:43.106 A:middle
Which is why we've come up with

00:17:43.106 --> 00:17:45.346 A:middle
a tool that can help simplify

00:17:45.346 --> 00:17:47.896 A:middle
this process, by allowing anyone

00:17:48.296 --> 00:17:50.666 A:middle
to create a custom prototype

00:17:50.776 --> 00:17:53.106 A:middle
CareKit app, without having to

00:17:53.106 --> 00:17:54.566 A:middle
write any code, at all.

00:17:54.566 --> 00:17:56.786 A:middle
Now, by the end of this talk

00:17:57.246 --> 00:17:58.436 A:middle
you'll be able to take a

00:17:58.436 --> 00:18:00.426 A:middle
treatment plan that looks like

00:18:00.426 --> 00:18:03.816 A:middle
this, and convert it into a

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:05.736 A:middle
prototype CareKit app that looks

00:18:05.736 --> 00:18:08.536 A:middle
like this, just by modifying the

00:18:08.536 --> 00:18:10.396 A:middle
contents of a human readable

00:18:10.396 --> 00:18:10.736 A:middle
file.

00:18:13.236 --> 00:18:14.966 A:middle
Now, before I show you guys how

00:18:14.966 --> 00:18:16.416 A:middle
this can be done with a demo,

00:18:16.416 --> 00:18:19.996 A:middle
let's take a step back in order

00:18:19.996 --> 00:18:21.976 A:middle
to see how this thing is wired

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:23.406 A:middle
up, under the hood.

00:18:25.136 --> 00:18:27.656 A:middle
So, what we have here, is a page

00:18:27.656 --> 00:18:29.446 A:middle
which we call the Care Contents

00:18:29.446 --> 00:18:29.676 A:middle
view.

00:18:30.466 --> 00:18:32.236 A:middle
You will be able to add all the

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:34.546 A:middle
medications and assessments

00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:37.046 A:middle
which you want your patients to

00:18:37.046 --> 00:18:39.146 A:middle
adhere to on a day to day basis.

00:18:40.276 --> 00:18:42.306 A:middle
What we have done is we have

00:18:42.376 --> 00:18:44.536 A:middle
created a mapping between the

00:18:44.536 --> 00:18:46.556 A:middle
underlying code that generates

00:18:46.556 --> 00:18:48.916 A:middle
this page, and the parameters

00:18:49.316 --> 00:18:50.986 A:middle
which define the characteristics

00:18:51.216 --> 00:18:52.986 A:middle
of every single element.

00:18:54.256 --> 00:18:56.306 A:middle
But let's take a closer look at

00:18:56.306 --> 00:18:57.316 A:middle
what I'm talking about.

00:18:58.456 --> 00:19:00.846 A:middle
So, what we have here, is called

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:01.906 A:middle
an assessment.

00:19:02.486 --> 00:19:03.936 A:middle
Now, your patients will be able

00:19:03.936 --> 00:19:04.876 A:middle
to tap on this.

00:19:05.756 --> 00:19:07.276 A:middle
And in this example, they'll be

00:19:07.276 --> 00:19:09.636 A:middle
able to enter a value in a scale

00:19:09.636 --> 00:19:11.386 A:middle
of one to ten, in order to

00:19:11.386 --> 00:19:13.056 A:middle
denote how much pain they are

00:19:13.056 --> 00:19:14.806 A:middle
experiencing at that given point

00:19:14.806 --> 00:19:15.226 A:middle
in time.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:17.776 A:middle
Now, this element can be

00:19:17.776 --> 00:19:19.986 A:middle
represented in a simple tabular

00:19:19.986 --> 00:19:22.326 A:middle
format that looks something like

00:19:22.326 --> 00:19:22.756 A:middle
this.

00:19:23.266 --> 00:19:27.156 A:middle
Now, the values which you type

00:19:27.156 --> 00:19:29.826 A:middle
into this table will help

00:19:29.876 --> 00:19:32.096 A:middle
characterize the element that

00:19:32.096 --> 00:19:33.476 A:middle
you're seeing on that page.

00:19:34.236 --> 00:19:36.336 A:middle
Now, let's try modifying some of

00:19:36.336 --> 00:19:37.426 A:middle
these values and see what

00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:37.896 A:middle
happens.

00:19:39.796 --> 00:19:41.996 A:middle
So, now I'm trying to create an

00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:44.176 A:middle
activity which is of type

00:19:44.176 --> 00:19:44.856 A:middle
intervention.

00:19:45.896 --> 00:19:47.716 A:middle
And more specifically, I want to

00:19:47.716 --> 00:19:49.756 A:middle
create an intervention for the

00:19:49.756 --> 00:19:51.066 A:middle
acetaminophen drug.

00:19:51.506 --> 00:19:56.736 A:middle
Now, this new table will map to

00:19:56.736 --> 00:19:59.066 A:middle
a totally different element on

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:00.976 A:middle
my UI, as you can see here.

00:20:01.666 --> 00:20:04.836 A:middle
I believe that now is a good

00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:07.686 A:middle
time for me to introduce to you,

00:20:07.846 --> 00:20:09.846 A:middle
as to how we have implemented

00:20:10.146 --> 00:20:10.786 A:middle
this mapping.

00:20:11.506 --> 00:20:13.566 A:middle
We are using something known as

00:20:13.746 --> 00:20:14.676 A:middle
a PLIST file.

00:20:15.446 --> 00:20:16.836 A:middle
Now, for all the developers in

00:20:16.836 --> 00:20:18.976 A:middle
the audience, you guys know that

00:20:18.976 --> 00:20:21.266 A:middle
a PLIST file is basically an xml

00:20:21.266 --> 00:20:22.636 A:middle
file, in which you can have key

00:20:22.636 --> 00:20:23.466 A:middle
value pairings.

00:20:24.566 --> 00:20:25.836 A:middle
But for our nontechnical

00:20:25.836 --> 00:20:27.896 A:middle
audience, you can think of it as

00:20:27.986 --> 00:20:29.966 A:middle
a form which has different

00:20:29.966 --> 00:20:31.686 A:middle
fields that you can fill out.

00:20:32.116 --> 00:20:36.066 A:middle
We have gone ahead and applied

00:20:36.066 --> 00:20:37.966 A:middle
this mapping throughout the

00:20:37.966 --> 00:20:38.766 A:middle
CareKit framework.

00:20:39.476 --> 00:20:42.366 A:middle
So, for example, here you see

00:20:42.606 --> 00:20:43.646 A:middle
the Insights tab.

00:20:44.816 --> 00:20:46.536 A:middle
This is a great place for you to

00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:49.096 A:middle
display critical information to

00:20:49.096 --> 00:20:50.606 A:middle
your patients in the form of

00:20:50.606 --> 00:20:52.876 A:middle
widgets, threshold parameters,

00:20:53.676 --> 00:20:55.766 A:middle
adherence messages, and charts.

00:20:56.486 --> 00:20:57.956 A:middle
All these elements are

00:20:57.956 --> 00:20:58.756 A:middle
configurable.

00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:01.296 A:middle
For example, the widgets that

00:21:01.296 --> 00:21:02.266 A:middle
you are seeing on top of your

00:21:02.266 --> 00:21:04.506 A:middle
screen here, can be easily

00:21:04.506 --> 00:21:06.356 A:middle
mapped, once again, to a tabular

00:21:06.356 --> 00:21:08.296 A:middle
format that looks something like

00:21:08.296 --> 00:21:08.656 A:middle
this.

00:21:10.056 --> 00:21:11.876 A:middle
And similarly, for the Contacts

00:21:11.876 --> 00:21:15.086 A:middle
tab, depending on what values

00:21:15.086 --> 00:21:17.016 A:middle
you provide as part of the PLIST

00:21:17.016 --> 00:21:18.736 A:middle
file, you'll be able to

00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:20.526 A:middle
characterize the contact which

00:21:20.526 --> 00:21:25.986 A:middle
you want to add.

00:21:25.986 --> 00:21:28.166 A:middle
So, now that we have seen how

00:21:28.166 --> 00:21:30.356 A:middle
this mapping methodology works,

00:21:31.216 --> 00:21:32.736 A:middle
in order for us to get started

00:21:32.736 --> 00:21:34.926 A:middle
on using this tool there are two

00:21:34.926 --> 00:21:36.206 A:middle
important components that are

00:21:36.206 --> 00:21:36.806 A:middle
necessary.

00:21:39.176 --> 00:21:42.356 A:middle
The first one is called XCode.

00:21:42.746 --> 00:21:45.996 A:middle
And to all the developers, here,

00:21:46.196 --> 00:21:48.236 A:middle
I hope you guys know what XCode

00:21:48.236 --> 00:21:49.016 A:middle
already is.

00:21:49.856 --> 00:21:51.646 A:middle
And for our nontechnical

00:21:51.646 --> 00:21:52.686 A:middle
audience, please bear with me

00:21:52.686 --> 00:21:53.656 A:middle
for a second, while I try to

00:21:53.656 --> 00:21:55.246 A:middle
explain to them, what XCode is

00:21:55.896 --> 00:21:57.096 A:middle
in a succinct manner.

00:21:57.706 --> 00:21:59.396 A:middle
You can think of XCode as the

00:21:59.396 --> 00:22:01.816 A:middle
one stop shop for creating apps

00:22:02.056 --> 00:22:03.686 A:middle
that can run on any Apple

00:22:03.686 --> 00:22:04.196 A:middle
device.

00:22:04.946 --> 00:22:07.676 A:middle
And let's leave it at that.

00:22:07.676 --> 00:22:09.206 A:middle
So, XCode is an application

00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:10.806 A:middle
which is provided by Apple.

00:22:11.326 --> 00:22:12.916 A:middle
And you can download it for free

00:22:13.216 --> 00:22:14.266 A:middle
from the Mac App Store.

00:22:15.396 --> 00:22:17.676 A:middle
You can just tap on install and

00:22:17.676 --> 00:22:19.386 A:middle
it'll automatically show up in

00:22:19.386 --> 00:22:20.556 A:middle
your Applications folder.

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:23.586 A:middle
Now, the second part to this

00:22:23.626 --> 00:22:26.716 A:middle
puzzle is called CareKit

00:22:26.716 --> 00:22:27.336 A:middle
Repository.

00:22:28.116 --> 00:22:29.706 A:middle
This is nothing else but a bunch

00:22:29.706 --> 00:22:31.056 A:middle
of files that you need to

00:22:31.056 --> 00:22:33.226 A:middle
download in order to start using

00:22:33.466 --> 00:22:34.696 A:middle
the CareKit Prototyping Tool.

00:22:35.446 --> 00:22:36.786 A:middle
And this is available from our

00:22:36.786 --> 00:22:38.726 A:middle
website, CareKit.org.

00:22:39.946 --> 00:22:42.156 A:middle
You can scroll down and tap on

00:22:42.156 --> 00:22:44.446 A:middle
the menu that says get it on

00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:44.786 A:middle
GitHub.

00:22:45.926 --> 00:22:47.586 A:middle
That'll take you to a new page.

00:22:48.096 --> 00:22:50.826 A:middle
And from there, you can click on

00:22:50.826 --> 00:22:52.146 A:middle
the Download button in order to

00:22:52.146 --> 00:22:53.886 A:middle
download a zip of the file.

00:22:54.406 --> 00:22:59.006 A:middle
Now that we are all set up to

00:22:59.006 --> 00:23:00.656 A:middle
start using this tool, let's

00:23:00.656 --> 00:23:02.396 A:middle
jump right into a demo where

00:23:02.396 --> 00:23:04.086 A:middle
I'll show you how you can build

00:23:04.406 --> 00:23:07.206 A:middle
a custom prototype CareKit app.

00:23:08.516 --> 00:23:12.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:23:14.676 --> 00:23:17.576 A:middle
So, this machine already has

00:23:17.686 --> 00:23:18.546 A:middle
XCode installed.

00:23:18.546 --> 00:23:19.626 A:middle
So, right now, what I'm going to

00:23:19.626 --> 00:23:21.086 A:middle
do, is I'm going to go ahead and

00:23:21.086 --> 00:23:23.136 A:middle
fetch the files from the CareKit

00:23:23.136 --> 00:23:23.736 A:middle
repository.

00:23:23.906 --> 00:23:25.366 A:middle
So, I'm going to type in here

00:23:25.746 --> 00:23:26.506 A:middle
CareKit.org.

00:23:27.216 --> 00:23:29.256 A:middle
I'm going to scroll down, get it

00:23:29.256 --> 00:23:31.306 A:middle
on GitHub, and when I tap on the

00:23:31.306 --> 00:23:32.346 A:middle
Download button, here, I have an

00:23:32.346 --> 00:23:33.646 A:middle
option that says Download Zip.

00:23:34.306 --> 00:23:35.676 A:middle
And you'll notice that the files

00:23:35.786 --> 00:23:36.976 A:middle
have downloaded, already.

00:23:37.826 --> 00:23:38.896 A:middle
So, let me open that up.

00:23:39.196 --> 00:23:40.856 A:middle
And now, I'm going to just close

00:23:40.856 --> 00:23:43.186 A:middle
out Safari, because I don't need

00:23:43.186 --> 00:23:43.706 A:middle
it anymore.

00:23:44.576 --> 00:23:45.886 A:middle
So, this is a bunch of files

00:23:45.886 --> 00:23:46.936 A:middle
which we will be able to see,

00:23:47.046 --> 00:23:47.786 A:middle
immediately.

00:23:48.226 --> 00:23:49.746 A:middle
And you don't have to bother

00:23:49.746 --> 00:23:50.456 A:middle
about all of them.

00:23:50.956 --> 00:23:51.946 A:middle
The files which you are

00:23:51.946 --> 00:23:53.636 A:middle
interested in is located in this

00:23:53.636 --> 00:23:54.956 A:middle
folder called the CareKit

00:23:54.996 --> 00:23:55.826 A:middle
Prototyping Tool.

00:23:56.456 --> 00:23:58.206 A:middle
And inside this, you can double

00:23:58.206 --> 00:24:00.286 A:middle
tap on OCKPrototyper.

00:24:00.286 --> 00:24:02.206 A:middle
And the particular file which

00:24:02.206 --> 00:24:03.576 A:middle
you need to open is called

00:24:03.856 --> 00:24:06.266 A:middle
OCKPrototyper dot xcodeproject.

00:24:06.666 --> 00:24:08.446 A:middle
So, now when I click on this and

00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:10.426 A:middle
tap Open, it'll automatically

00:24:10.426 --> 00:24:12.116 A:middle
launch using the XCode app,

00:24:12.436 --> 00:24:14.276 A:middle
which I just downloaded from the

00:24:14.826 --> 00:24:16.166 A:middle
App Store.

00:24:16.356 --> 00:24:18.236 A:middle
So, this is your first look at

00:24:18.236 --> 00:24:18.676 A:middle
XCode.

00:24:19.126 --> 00:24:20.636 A:middle
And before we get started with

00:24:20.816 --> 00:24:23.116 A:middle
modifying anything, let's try to

00:24:23.116 --> 00:24:25.226 A:middle
run this Prototype app and see

00:24:25.226 --> 00:24:26.106 A:middle
what is looks like.

00:24:26.576 --> 00:24:28.376 A:middle
Now, in order to do that, you

00:24:28.376 --> 00:24:30.566 A:middle
have to focus on the top left

00:24:30.566 --> 00:24:31.256 A:middle
corner, only.

00:24:31.766 --> 00:24:33.156 A:middle
Make sure that you have selected

00:24:33.156 --> 00:24:34.096 A:middle
CareKit Patient.

00:24:34.136 --> 00:24:35.466 A:middle
These individual elements are

00:24:35.466 --> 00:24:36.176 A:middle
called schemes.

00:24:36.606 --> 00:24:37.736 A:middle
And we are interested in the

00:24:37.736 --> 00:24:38.746 A:middle
CareKit Patient scheme.

00:24:39.296 --> 00:24:40.706 A:middle
And then, you need to decide

00:24:40.706 --> 00:24:42.266 A:middle
which device do you want to run

00:24:42.266 --> 00:24:43.476 A:middle
your prototype app on.

00:24:44.156 --> 00:24:45.826 A:middle
And here, I'm going to select

00:24:45.826 --> 00:24:46.826 A:middle
iPhone 7 Plus.

00:24:47.356 --> 00:24:49.076 A:middle
And in order to start running

00:24:49.076 --> 00:24:50.366 A:middle
this, all you have to do is

00:24:50.366 --> 00:24:52.126 A:middle
press the Play button, right

00:24:52.126 --> 00:24:52.396 A:middle
here.

00:24:53.516 --> 00:24:54.216 A:middle
So, there we go.

00:24:55.726 --> 00:24:57.406 A:middle
So, here you'll notice that we

00:24:57.406 --> 00:24:59.186 A:middle
have launched a new window, and

00:24:59.186 --> 00:25:00.316 A:middle
this is called the iPhone

00:25:00.316 --> 00:25:00.906 A:middle
Simulator.

00:25:01.176 --> 00:25:02.376 A:middle
This is an application which

00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:04.286 A:middle
tries to mimic an iOS device,

00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:05.616 A:middle
very accurately.

00:25:06.306 --> 00:25:08.446 A:middle
So, here you'll notice that the

00:25:08.446 --> 00:25:09.276 A:middle
app has launched.

00:25:09.596 --> 00:25:11.326 A:middle
It already has the three

00:25:11.326 --> 00:25:12.196 A:middle
important tabs.

00:25:12.196 --> 00:25:13.306 A:middle
The first one is called Care

00:25:13.306 --> 00:25:13.876 A:middle
Contents.

00:25:14.316 --> 00:25:16.036 A:middle
Now, as I start interacting with

00:25:16.106 --> 00:25:17.846 A:middle
every single element to indicate

00:25:17.846 --> 00:25:18.976 A:middle
that I've completed this

00:25:18.976 --> 00:25:20.726 A:middle
medication, you'll notice that

00:25:20.726 --> 00:25:22.326 A:middle
it is contributing towards my

00:25:22.326 --> 00:25:23.536 A:middle
daily completion goal.

00:25:23.826 --> 00:25:25.436 A:middle
Which is my adherence, as well.

00:25:26.096 --> 00:25:27.976 A:middle
The next one is called Insights.

00:25:28.276 --> 00:25:29.266 A:middle
Here, you'll notice that I

00:25:29.266 --> 00:25:30.776 A:middle
already have a couple of widget

00:25:30.776 --> 00:25:31.206 A:middle
items.

00:25:31.656 --> 00:25:34.166 A:middle
And I have a prepopulated chart,

00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:34.586 A:middle
as well.

00:25:35.056 --> 00:25:37.066 A:middle
The final tab is called Connect.

00:25:37.556 --> 00:25:38.676 A:middle
Here, you have the different

00:25:38.676 --> 00:25:39.946 A:middle
contact, along with some

00:25:39.946 --> 00:25:40.556 A:middle
information.

00:25:40.886 --> 00:25:42.356 A:middle
And you also, have the brand new

00:25:42.356 --> 00:25:44.156 A:middle
Inbox UI, which Sam spoke about.

00:25:44.556 --> 00:25:46.546 A:middle
So, you can tap in here, type

00:25:46.546 --> 00:25:48.706 A:middle
out a message if you want, click

00:25:48.706 --> 00:25:50.086 A:middle
Send, and it'll behave the way

00:25:50.086 --> 00:25:51.166 A:middle
you would expect it to.

00:25:52.426 --> 00:25:53.486 A:middle
So, now that we have done all

00:25:53.486 --> 00:25:55.126 A:middle
this, let's actually start

00:25:55.586 --> 00:25:56.956 A:middle
modifying some of these things.

00:25:57.696 --> 00:25:59.136 A:middle
Now say, for example, that you

00:25:59.136 --> 00:26:00.636 A:middle
took screenshots of these

00:26:00.636 --> 00:26:03.006 A:middle
different pages, and you showed

00:26:03.006 --> 00:26:04.006 A:middle
it to some colleague.

00:26:04.616 --> 00:26:07.036 A:middle
And I did something similar, and

00:26:07.036 --> 00:26:08.636 A:middle
I got a feedback that said,

00:26:09.186 --> 00:26:11.026 A:middle
''This looks comprehensive, but

00:26:11.026 --> 00:26:12.716 A:middle
let's add a few more things.''

00:26:13.216 --> 00:26:15.306 A:middle
So, one of the main feedback was

00:26:15.306 --> 00:26:16.926 A:middle
that I should add a new

00:26:16.926 --> 00:26:18.836 A:middle
medication for ibuprofen.

00:26:19.526 --> 00:26:21.246 A:middle
Next, they wanted me to add a

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:22.276 A:middle
new assessment.

00:26:22.736 --> 00:26:24.416 A:middle
And then, finally, they also

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:25.926 A:middle
were a bit critical about the

00:26:25.926 --> 00:26:27.186 A:middle
glyph icon, here, and they

00:26:27.186 --> 00:26:28.736 A:middle
wanted me to switch that out.

00:26:29.056 --> 00:26:30.326 A:middle
So, let's see how we can do

00:26:31.006 --> 00:26:31.106 A:middle
that.

00:26:31.636 --> 00:26:33.546 A:middle
So, I'm going to go back into

00:26:33.546 --> 00:26:33.956 A:middle
XCode.

00:26:34.836 --> 00:26:36.146 A:middle
And all the files can be

00:26:36.146 --> 00:26:36.786 A:middle
accessed, here.

00:26:36.786 --> 00:26:39.266 A:middle
And I can tap on this little

00:26:39.266 --> 00:26:40.546 A:middle
arrow button, here, in order to

00:26:40.546 --> 00:26:41.136 A:middle
collapse it.

00:26:41.596 --> 00:26:42.556 A:middle
And the files which I am

00:26:42.556 --> 00:26:43.966 A:middle
interested in are the PLIST

00:26:43.966 --> 00:26:44.326 A:middle
files.

00:26:44.936 --> 00:26:46.136 A:middle
So, there are two files that are

00:26:46.136 --> 00:26:47.726 A:middle
available, here, Patient dot

00:26:47.726 --> 00:26:49.626 A:middle
plist and Template dot plist.

00:26:49.926 --> 00:26:51.526 A:middle
Template, as the name suggests,

00:26:51.816 --> 00:26:53.566 A:middle
just has some guidance on what

00:26:53.606 --> 00:26:55.876 A:middle
values you can or cannot use for

00:26:55.876 --> 00:26:56.626 A:middle
certain fields.

00:26:57.246 --> 00:26:58.516 A:middle
But the file which actually

00:26:58.516 --> 00:27:00.196 A:middle
tells all the tricks behind is

00:27:00.456 --> 00:27:01.396 A:middle
Patient dot plist.

00:27:01.776 --> 00:27:02.966 A:middle
Now, you notice that there are

00:27:02.966 --> 00:27:04.826 A:middle
five sections available, and

00:27:04.856 --> 00:27:06.226 A:middle
each one corresponds to a

00:27:06.226 --> 00:27:08.356 A:middle
specific element in your

00:27:08.356 --> 00:27:09.006 A:middle
Prototype app.

00:27:09.436 --> 00:27:11.596 A:middle
Now, if I want to add a new

00:27:11.596 --> 00:27:13.526 A:middle
intervention or assessment, the

00:27:13.526 --> 00:27:15.326 A:middle
subsection which I'm interested

00:27:15.326 --> 00:27:17.176 A:middle
in the most, is Care Contents.

00:27:17.336 --> 00:27:18.616 A:middle
So, let me go ahead and see what

00:27:18.616 --> 00:27:19.746 A:middle
is already available.

00:27:19.956 --> 00:27:21.546 A:middle
So, I collapse it, and there are

00:27:21.656 --> 00:27:22.926 A:middle
there items available for me.

00:27:23.526 --> 00:27:24.856 A:middle
So, the first one is an

00:27:24.856 --> 00:27:25.566 A:middle
intervention.

00:27:25.946 --> 00:27:26.896 A:middle
And this is for the

00:27:26.896 --> 00:27:28.606 A:middle
acetaminophen medication, which

00:27:28.606 --> 00:27:30.576 A:middle
you saw in the Prototype app.

00:27:31.196 --> 00:27:33.416 A:middle
The next one is an assessment

00:27:33.666 --> 00:27:34.366 A:middle
for pain.

00:27:35.286 --> 00:27:37.546 A:middle
And the final one is Read Only.

00:27:38.416 --> 00:27:41.116 A:middle
So, in order to start creating a

00:27:41.116 --> 00:27:42.926 A:middle
new intervention, the easiest

00:27:42.926 --> 00:27:44.626 A:middle
thing to do is to just right

00:27:44.626 --> 00:27:46.286 A:middle
click on it and click Copy.

00:27:46.876 --> 00:27:48.776 A:middle
And now, I can paste it back

00:27:48.966 --> 00:27:49.486 A:middle
right in.

00:27:50.376 --> 00:27:51.886 A:middle
So, here I can go ahead and

00:27:51.886 --> 00:27:52.866 A:middle
modify the values.

00:27:53.656 --> 00:27:55.266 A:middle
So, for identifier, they need to

00:27:55.266 --> 00:27:56.836 A:middle
be unique across all my

00:27:56.836 --> 00:27:57.486 A:middle
activities.

00:27:57.706 --> 00:27:59.086 A:middle
So, in this case, I'm going to

00:27:59.216 --> 00:28:00.606 A:middle
just keep it the name of the

00:28:00.606 --> 00:28:01.746 A:middle
medication, which I am trying to

00:28:01.746 --> 00:28:01.976 A:middle
add.

00:28:02.676 --> 00:28:03.996 A:middle
So, the title is going to be

00:28:03.996 --> 00:28:04.726 A:middle
Ibuprofen.

00:28:05.456 --> 00:28:07.386 A:middle
The dosage here, is going to be

00:28:07.386 --> 00:28:08.596 A:middle
about 200 milligrams.

00:28:09.086 --> 00:28:10.516 A:middle
And instructions, I can say

00:28:10.516 --> 00:28:12.096 A:middle
something like ''Take as

00:28:12.096 --> 00:28:14.276 A:middle
needed.'' And one more thing

00:28:14.276 --> 00:28:15.606 A:middle
which I can do is set the tint

00:28:15.606 --> 00:28:16.626 A:middle
color of the circles that

00:28:16.626 --> 00:28:17.036 A:middle
appear.

00:28:17.276 --> 00:28:18.576 A:middle
So, in this case, let's say I

00:28:18.576 --> 00:28:19.986 A:middle
want to set the green color.

00:28:20.396 --> 00:28:22.116 A:middle
So, here I can put in a hex

00:28:22.116 --> 00:28:22.876 A:middle
value, directly.

00:28:22.876 --> 00:28:23.806 A:middle
So, I'm going to just try

00:28:24.796 --> 00:28:27.146 A:middle
0x00ff00, which stands for

00:28:27.146 --> 00:28:27.416 A:middle
green.

00:28:27.666 --> 00:28:28.956 A:middle
And it'll automatically convert

00:28:28.956 --> 00:28:30.636 A:middle
it to its decimal equivalent.

00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:32.536 A:middle
And one other important thing

00:28:32.536 --> 00:28:34.196 A:middle
about adding medications, is

00:28:34.196 --> 00:28:35.636 A:middle
that you should specify the

00:28:35.636 --> 00:28:36.416 A:middle
schedule, as well.

00:28:36.706 --> 00:28:37.966 A:middle
How many dosages are your

00:28:37.966 --> 00:28:39.306 A:middle
patients supposed to take, and

00:28:39.306 --> 00:28:39.576 A:middle
when.

00:28:39.936 --> 00:28:42.106 A:middle
That can be specified by going

00:28:42.106 --> 00:28:44.046 A:middle
to the Schedule subsection.

00:28:44.926 --> 00:28:46.376 A:middle
And under this, you can specify

00:28:46.376 --> 00:28:48.176 A:middle
the start date and date, as well

00:28:48.176 --> 00:28:49.626 A:middle
as occurrences on each week.

00:28:50.066 --> 00:28:50.796 A:middle
So, I'm going to go to

00:28:50.796 --> 00:28:51.506 A:middle
Occurrences.

00:28:51.506 --> 00:28:52.556 A:middle
And you'll notice that this

00:28:52.556 --> 00:28:53.736 A:middle
looks kind of weird.

00:28:54.286 --> 00:28:56.306 A:middle
But this pretty straightforward,

00:28:56.306 --> 00:28:57.226 A:middle
in the sense that there are

00:28:57.226 --> 00:28:58.906 A:middle
seven elements, here, which map

00:28:58.976 --> 00:29:00.536 A:middle
to the seven days of the week.

00:29:00.796 --> 00:29:02.536 A:middle
Starting from Sunday all the way

00:29:02.536 --> 00:29:03.136 A:middle
to Saturday.

00:29:03.616 --> 00:29:05.746 A:middle
So, if I want to prescribe two

00:29:05.746 --> 00:29:07.826 A:middle
dosages of ibuprofen on every

00:29:07.826 --> 00:29:09.386 A:middle
single day, I can just change

00:29:09.386 --> 00:29:11.906 A:middle
these values to two on all seven

00:29:11.906 --> 00:29:12.156 A:middle
days.

00:29:12.876 --> 00:29:15.056 A:middle
And with that, I'm done adding a

00:29:15.056 --> 00:29:16.696 A:middle
new medication to my Prototype

00:29:16.696 --> 00:29:16.886 A:middle
app.

00:29:17.716 --> 00:29:18.816 A:middle
The next thing which I want to

00:29:18.816 --> 00:29:20.416 A:middle
do, is add an assessment.

00:29:20.726 --> 00:29:21.796 A:middle
So, I'm going to follow the same

00:29:21.796 --> 00:29:23.516 A:middle
routine, where I copy, paste an

00:29:23.516 --> 00:29:26.596 A:middle
existing assessment.

00:29:27.446 --> 00:29:28.856 A:middle
And I'm going to change this to

00:29:28.856 --> 00:29:29.266 A:middle
Mood.

00:29:29.526 --> 00:29:31.316 A:middle
I want to create the mood of my

00:29:31.316 --> 00:29:31.876 A:middle
patient.

00:29:33.546 --> 00:29:34.496 A:middle
So, here Mood.

00:29:35.096 --> 00:29:37.036 A:middle
Ten being very happy.

00:29:39.426 --> 00:29:41.126 A:middle
And one more thing you can do,

00:29:41.126 --> 00:29:43.416 A:middle
when it comes to assessment, is

00:29:43.416 --> 00:29:45.016 A:middle
that you can leverage the new

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:46.756 A:middle
threshold functionality, which

00:29:46.756 --> 00:29:47.476 A:middle
we spoke about.

00:29:48.246 --> 00:29:50.196 A:middle
So, in this case, what I want to

00:29:50.196 --> 00:29:52.056 A:middle
do, is if my patient enters a

00:29:52.056 --> 00:29:53.746 A:middle
value which is below a certain

00:29:53.746 --> 00:29:55.546 A:middle
threshold, I want to display

00:29:55.546 --> 00:29:57.546 A:middle
some sort of an alert to them.

00:29:58.026 --> 00:29:59.326 A:middle
Which could be very important,

00:29:59.326 --> 00:29:59.976 A:middle
depending on the scenario.

00:30:00.046 --> 00:30:02.486 A:middle
So, let's see how that can be

00:30:02.486 --> 00:30:02.776 A:middle
done.

00:30:02.916 --> 00:30:04.606 A:middle
So, I'm going to click on

00:30:04.606 --> 00:30:05.026 A:middle
Threshold.

00:30:05.026 --> 00:30:06.306 A:middle
You'll see that there's an item

00:30:06.306 --> 00:30:07.136 A:middle
available, already.

00:30:07.186 --> 00:30:08.816 A:middle
You can add multiple items to

00:30:08.816 --> 00:30:10.076 A:middle
the same Threshold, as well.

00:30:10.606 --> 00:30:11.876 A:middle
But in this case, I just want

00:30:11.876 --> 00:30:12.226 A:middle
one.

00:30:12.776 --> 00:30:15.516 A:middle
If the value entered by my user

00:30:15.786 --> 00:30:20.856 A:middle
is less than three, I want to

00:30:20.856 --> 00:30:22.056 A:middle
throw an alert that says,

00:30:23.376 --> 00:30:26.406 A:middle
''Please reduce pain medication

00:30:27.336 --> 00:30:31.516 A:middle
dosages by half.'' And the final

00:30:31.516 --> 00:30:32.516 A:middle
thing which I need to do, is set

00:30:32.516 --> 00:30:33.576 A:middle
the schedule, as well.

00:30:33.576 --> 00:30:35.176 A:middle
And I want this to repeat once

00:30:35.176 --> 00:30:35.596 A:middle
every day.

00:30:35.596 --> 00:30:36.886 A:middle
Right now, it is repeating on

00:30:36.886 --> 00:30:38.116 A:middle
alternate days of the week.

00:30:38.756 --> 00:30:39.866 A:middle
So, I can just go ahead and

00:30:39.866 --> 00:30:41.406 A:middle
switch that out, as well.

00:30:41.926 --> 00:30:46.346 A:middle
And that's it.

00:30:46.586 --> 00:30:48.226 A:middle
So, the final thing which I need

00:30:48.226 --> 00:30:49.956 A:middle
to do, based on my feedback, was

00:30:49.956 --> 00:30:51.006 A:middle
to change the glyph type.

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:52.576 A:middle
And looking at the different

00:30:52.576 --> 00:30:53.886 A:middle
subsections, you'll notice that

00:30:53.886 --> 00:30:54.856 A:middle
there's one that says UI

00:30:54.856 --> 00:30:55.696 A:middle
customization.

00:30:55.696 --> 00:30:56.746 A:middle
So, that is probably a good

00:30:56.746 --> 00:30:57.466 A:middle
place to start.

00:30:58.046 --> 00:30:59.126 A:middle
And here, you'll notice that

00:30:59.126 --> 00:31:00.966 A:middle
there is a subsection which says

00:31:00.966 --> 00:31:01.936 A:middle
Care Content UI.

00:31:02.506 --> 00:31:04.006 A:middle
Glyph icons, typically, appear

00:31:04.006 --> 00:31:06.616 A:middle
only in Care Contents view.

00:31:07.066 --> 00:31:08.226 A:middle
So, I'm going to go ahead and

00:31:08.226 --> 00:31:08.756 A:middle
click on that.

00:31:08.906 --> 00:31:10.806 A:middle
And there is an option available

00:31:10.806 --> 00:31:11.506 A:middle
for glyph type.

00:31:11.556 --> 00:31:12.966 A:middle
Currently, it is pointing to

00:31:12.966 --> 00:31:13.456 A:middle
Home Care.

00:31:13.906 --> 00:31:15.526 A:middle
I'm going to switch this out to

00:31:15.766 --> 00:31:16.136 A:middle
Heart.

00:31:17.586 --> 00:31:19.236 A:middle
Now, obviously, there are only

00:31:19.236 --> 00:31:20.486 A:middle
certain values that you can

00:31:20.486 --> 00:31:21.076 A:middle
enter, here.

00:31:21.306 --> 00:31:23.146 A:middle
And all those are listed in your

00:31:23.146 --> 00:31:24.386 A:middle
Template dot plist file.

00:31:24.386 --> 00:31:26.386 A:middle
So, you can reference it as you

00:31:26.386 --> 00:31:27.086 A:middle
are going about it.

00:31:28.266 --> 00:31:29.516 A:middle
And now that I'm done, I'm just

00:31:29.516 --> 00:31:32.316 A:middle
going to go ahead and click this

00:31:32.316 --> 00:31:33.076 A:middle
Play button, again.

00:31:33.376 --> 00:31:34.396 A:middle
And let's see what happens.

00:31:35.626 --> 00:31:37.106 A:middle
So, I have the Simulator, here.

00:31:37.536 --> 00:31:38.676 A:middle
And there you go, my app

00:31:38.676 --> 00:31:39.116 A:middle
launches.

00:31:39.606 --> 00:31:40.906 A:middle
First thing, you'll notice that

00:31:40.906 --> 00:31:42.396 A:middle
my glyph icon has changed to

00:31:42.396 --> 00:31:42.766 A:middle
Heart.

00:31:43.176 --> 00:31:44.776 A:middle
There is a new survey.

00:31:45.526 --> 00:31:47.006 A:middle
And you'll notice that there's a

00:31:47.006 --> 00:31:48.656 A:middle
new ibuprofen medication, as

00:31:48.656 --> 00:31:48.886 A:middle
well.

00:31:48.886 --> 00:31:50.336 A:middle
And it came in the tint color

00:31:50.336 --> 00:31:51.986 A:middle
which I specified it as.

00:31:52.486 --> 00:31:54.236 A:middle
And once again, you can go ahead

00:31:54.236 --> 00:31:55.876 A:middle
and interact with all of them,

00:31:56.156 --> 00:31:57.276 A:middle
and they will automatically

00:31:57.276 --> 00:31:58.606 A:middle
contribute to what's your daily

00:31:58.606 --> 00:31:59.466 A:middle
goals, as well.

00:32:00.686 --> 00:32:02.296 A:middle
So, I can go to the Insights tab

00:32:02.296 --> 00:32:02.976 A:middle
and you'll notice that,

00:32:03.036 --> 00:32:03.906 A:middle
currently, there are no

00:32:03.906 --> 00:32:05.306 A:middle
threshold alerts available for

00:32:05.306 --> 00:32:05.516 A:middle
me.

00:32:06.106 --> 00:32:08.346 A:middle
But if I go to my survey, and if

00:32:08.346 --> 00:32:09.626 A:middle
I enter a value which is less

00:32:09.626 --> 00:32:10.126 A:middle
than three.

00:32:10.566 --> 00:32:11.576 A:middle
So, I'm going to enter two, in

00:32:11.576 --> 00:32:12.086 A:middle
this case.

00:32:12.726 --> 00:32:14.216 A:middle
And if I go back to Insights,

00:32:14.216 --> 00:32:15.286 A:middle
you'll notice that we have

00:32:15.376 --> 00:32:16.926 A:middle
automatically calculated that,

00:32:16.926 --> 00:32:18.296 A:middle
and we are displaying an alert

00:32:18.416 --> 00:32:20.406 A:middle
for your patients to view within

00:32:20.406 --> 00:32:21.626 A:middle
the Prototype app, as well.

00:32:22.396 --> 00:32:24.866 A:middle
And that is the demo for this

00:32:24.866 --> 00:32:25.116 A:middle
tool.

00:32:26.516 --> 00:32:32.416 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:32.916 --> 00:32:35.086 A:middle
So, you guys saw how easy it is

00:32:35.156 --> 00:32:37.206 A:middle
to create a prototype CareKit

00:32:37.206 --> 00:32:40.036 A:middle
app that is tailor made for your

00:32:40.036 --> 00:32:40.956 A:middle
custom need.

00:32:42.856 --> 00:32:44.666 A:middle
Now, I would like to go over a

00:32:44.666 --> 00:32:46.686 A:middle
quick overview of the CareKit

00:32:46.686 --> 00:32:47.566 A:middle
Prototyping Tool.

00:32:48.286 --> 00:32:50.086 A:middle
And to switch things up, I want

00:32:50.086 --> 00:32:51.766 A:middle
to start off by acknowledging

00:32:51.856 --> 00:32:53.476 A:middle
some of the limitations of this

00:32:53.476 --> 00:32:53.756 A:middle
tool.

00:32:55.086 --> 00:32:56.936 A:middle
First and foremost, this can be

00:32:56.936 --> 00:32:58.706 A:middle
used for prototyping only.

00:32:59.506 --> 00:33:00.786 A:middle
There's no way that you can

00:33:00.786 --> 00:33:02.416 A:middle
build a fully functioning app

00:33:02.416 --> 00:33:03.636 A:middle
using this tool, which you can

00:33:03.636 --> 00:33:06.826 A:middle
immediately share using the App

00:33:07.946 --> 00:33:08.066 A:middle
Store.

00:33:08.266 --> 00:33:09.976 A:middle
There's no support for adding

00:33:09.976 --> 00:33:10.726 A:middle
custom views.

00:33:12.206 --> 00:33:14.116 A:middle
And you won't be able to

00:33:14.116 --> 00:33:16.166 A:middle
integrate with any of the

00:33:16.166 --> 00:33:19.076 A:middle
frameworks which we provide as

00:33:19.076 --> 00:33:20.816 A:middle
part of the Apple ecosystem.

00:33:21.396 --> 00:33:23.596 A:middle
So, for example, if you want to

00:33:23.596 --> 00:33:25.146 A:middle
create the heartrate of your

00:33:25.146 --> 00:33:26.716 A:middle
patient from their Apple Watch

00:33:26.976 --> 00:33:28.766 A:middle
and display that back to them in

00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:30.826 A:middle
the form of a widget, that is

00:33:30.826 --> 00:33:31.896 A:middle
not something you'll be able to

00:33:31.896 --> 00:33:32.916 A:middle
do using the tool.

00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:33.986 A:middle
You'll be able to create a

00:33:33.986 --> 00:33:35.496 A:middle
mockup of that, but not the

00:33:35.496 --> 00:33:36.626 A:middle
actual implementation.

00:33:37.076 --> 00:33:39.526 A:middle
And now, let's deal with some of

00:33:39.526 --> 00:33:41.086 A:middle
the features for this tool.

00:33:41.746 --> 00:33:44.506 A:middle
You could be a physician or a

00:33:44.506 --> 00:33:45.526 A:middle
PhD student.

00:33:45.786 --> 00:33:47.126 A:middle
You'll be able to pick up and

00:33:47.126 --> 00:33:48.786 A:middle
start using this tool without

00:33:48.786 --> 00:33:50.336 A:middle
having to write any code, at

00:33:50.336 --> 00:33:50.586 A:middle
all.

00:33:51.976 --> 00:33:53.366 A:middle
The second thing, is that you

00:33:53.366 --> 00:33:55.426 A:middle
can create multiple PLISTs and

00:33:55.426 --> 00:33:56.826 A:middle
switch between them, thus

00:33:56.826 --> 00:33:58.536 A:middle
allowing for rapid prototyping.

00:33:59.046 --> 00:34:00.126 A:middle
And because the CareKit

00:34:00.126 --> 00:34:01.976 A:middle
framework is opensource, if you

00:34:01.976 --> 00:34:03.496 A:middle
have created a PLIST for your

00:34:03.496 --> 00:34:04.876 A:middle
custom case and if you want to

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:06.516 A:middle
share it with the community, you

00:34:06.516 --> 00:34:07.486 A:middle
can do that, as well.

00:34:09.026 --> 00:34:10.876 A:middle
It is highly customizable,

00:34:10.876 --> 00:34:11.996 A:middle
because we have applied this

00:34:11.996 --> 00:34:14.006 A:middle
mapping approach throughout the

00:34:14.006 --> 00:34:14.906 A:middle
CareKit framework.

00:34:15.476 --> 00:34:17.606 A:middle
And finally, if you are a

00:34:17.606 --> 00:34:19.676 A:middle
developer, and if you are really

00:34:19.676 --> 00:34:20.916 A:middle
interested in any of the

00:34:20.916 --> 00:34:22.336 A:middle
features we spoke about, today.

00:34:22.836 --> 00:34:23.906 A:middle
And you want to try it out for

00:34:23.906 --> 00:34:26.066 A:middle
yourself, you can give it a spin

00:34:26.066 --> 00:34:27.456 A:middle
using the CareKit Prototyping

00:34:27.456 --> 00:34:27.686 A:middle
Tool.

00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:29.406 A:middle
And then, make an informed

00:34:29.406 --> 00:34:31.196 A:middle
decision as to whether or not

00:34:31.196 --> 00:34:32.926 A:middle
you want to incorporate this as

00:34:32.926 --> 00:34:34.626 A:middle
part of your app.

00:34:34.626 --> 00:34:35.886 A:middle
And for the designers out there,

00:34:36.096 --> 00:34:37.416 A:middle
if you have created brand new

00:34:37.416 --> 00:34:39.186 A:middle
assets, you can plug them into

00:34:39.186 --> 00:34:40.736 A:middle
the project in the Assets

00:34:40.736 --> 00:34:41.226 A:middle
catalog.

00:34:41.696 --> 00:34:43.536 A:middle
And then, reference them using a

00:34:43.576 --> 00:34:46.386 A:middle
PLIST file, and build the apps

00:34:46.386 --> 00:34:47.976 A:middle
which can run across multiple

00:34:47.976 --> 00:34:48.636 A:middle
devices.

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:51.156 A:middle
And all this can be done without

00:34:51.156 --> 00:34:52.356 A:middle
having to write any code.

00:34:55.076 --> 00:34:57.506 A:middle
We really hope that this tool

00:34:57.506 --> 00:34:59.366 A:middle
can help bridge the gap between

00:34:59.366 --> 00:35:01.386 A:middle
the nontechnical audience and

00:35:01.386 --> 00:35:04.156 A:middle
our amazing and vibrant iOS app

00:35:04.156 --> 00:35:05.086 A:middle
developer community.

00:35:05.566 --> 00:35:07.576 A:middle
In such a way that it can spur

00:35:07.576 --> 00:35:09.096 A:middle
innovation in the field of

00:35:09.096 --> 00:35:10.906 A:middle
healthcare centric apps that can

00:35:10.906 --> 00:35:12.896 A:middle
have a meaningful and lasting

00:35:12.896 --> 00:35:14.496 A:middle
impact on the lives of our

00:35:14.496 --> 00:35:15.136 A:middle
users.

00:35:15.486 --> 00:35:17.126 A:middle
And with that, back to you, Sam.

00:35:18.106 --> 00:35:18.896 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Srinath.

00:35:19.766 --> 00:35:21.126 A:middle
So, we're super excited about

00:35:21.126 --> 00:35:21.856 A:middle
tools like these.

00:35:21.856 --> 00:35:23.056 A:middle
We think they can really

00:35:23.056 --> 00:35:24.396 A:middle
accelerate the learning and the

00:35:24.396 --> 00:35:26.066 A:middle
community, and bring your ideas

00:35:26.066 --> 00:35:27.236 A:middle
for CareKit apps to life, that

00:35:27.236 --> 00:35:27.926 A:middle
much faster.

00:35:28.956 --> 00:35:29.886 A:middle
So, with that, I'd like to go

00:35:29.886 --> 00:35:30.846 A:middle
ahead and start wrapping up out

00:35:30.846 --> 00:35:32.386 A:middle
talk, now, by reminding all of

00:35:32.386 --> 00:35:33.926 A:middle
you that ResearchKit and CareKit

00:35:33.926 --> 00:35:34.946 A:middle
are opensource.

00:35:35.316 --> 00:35:36.276 A:middle
And so, that means that they

00:35:36.276 --> 00:35:38.256 A:middle
truly are what we make of it.

00:35:38.566 --> 00:35:42.626 A:middle
Yes. So, we are so excited about

00:35:42.626 --> 00:35:44.066 A:middle
your participation, so far.

00:35:44.316 --> 00:35:45.726 A:middle
And of course, we have some

00:35:45.726 --> 00:35:47.156 A:middle
ideas and suggestions of where

00:35:47.156 --> 00:35:48.316 A:middle
we think that these could go,

00:35:48.316 --> 00:35:48.796 A:middle
together.

00:35:50.016 --> 00:35:52.016 A:middle
So, first off, up until this

00:35:52.016 --> 00:35:53.426 A:middle
point, ResearchKit and CareKit

00:35:53.426 --> 00:35:54.496 A:middle
has focused solely on the

00:35:54.496 --> 00:35:55.816 A:middle
participants and the patients.

00:35:56.186 --> 00:35:57.496 A:middle
But we understand that all this

00:35:57.496 --> 00:35:59.066 A:middle
new data flowing through from

00:35:59.066 --> 00:36:00.876 A:middle
these populations is extremely

00:36:00.876 --> 00:36:02.876 A:middle
valuable to both researchers and

00:36:02.876 --> 00:36:03.486 A:middle
care teams.

00:36:04.066 --> 00:36:05.136 A:middle
And so, that means it's really

00:36:05.136 --> 00:36:06.406 A:middle
important for all of us to start

00:36:06.406 --> 00:36:07.636 A:middle
thinking about the best way to

00:36:07.636 --> 00:36:09.366 A:middle
visualize this population data

00:36:09.646 --> 00:36:10.376 A:middle
for researchers.

00:36:10.376 --> 00:36:11.466 A:middle
So, that way they can gain the

00:36:11.466 --> 00:36:12.516 A:middle
most insights from their

00:36:12.516 --> 00:36:13.266 A:middle
research studies.

00:36:13.646 --> 00:36:15.086 A:middle
As well as for care teams, that

00:36:15.086 --> 00:36:16.486 A:middle
way they understand how to best

00:36:16.486 --> 00:36:18.406 A:middle
monitor or update care plans

00:36:18.456 --> 00:36:19.556 A:middle
based on their patient data.

00:36:20.896 --> 00:36:22.626 A:middle
Additionally, if you start to

00:36:22.626 --> 00:36:23.996 A:middle
build hooks into your apps, that

00:36:23.996 --> 00:36:24.956 A:middle
let them integrate with

00:36:24.956 --> 00:36:26.136 A:middle
different EMR systems.

00:36:26.476 --> 00:36:27.546 A:middle
We would love for you to build

00:36:27.546 --> 00:36:28.726 A:middle
those hooks in such a way that

00:36:28.726 --> 00:36:29.716 A:middle
you can bring them back to the

00:36:29.716 --> 00:36:30.286 A:middle
community.

00:36:30.396 --> 00:36:31.866 A:middle
And let others leverage these

00:36:31.866 --> 00:36:32.596 A:middle
capabilities.

00:36:33.346 --> 00:36:34.936 A:middle
And lastly, we feel that there's

00:36:34.936 --> 00:36:36.876 A:middle
always room to build new modules

00:36:37.116 --> 00:36:38.306 A:middle
for both of our frameworks.

00:36:38.306 --> 00:36:39.646 A:middle
And these modules could support

00:36:39.646 --> 00:36:40.946 A:middle
things like rich educational

00:36:40.946 --> 00:36:42.956 A:middle
content or social networking and

00:36:42.956 --> 00:36:44.086 A:middle
community platforms.

00:36:44.086 --> 00:36:45.156 A:middle
That way, participants and

00:36:45.156 --> 00:36:46.306 A:middle
patients can connect with each

00:36:46.306 --> 00:36:46.596 A:middle
other.

00:36:47.086 --> 00:36:48.226 A:middle
As well as different reward

00:36:48.226 --> 00:36:49.686 A:middle
systems, so that way, users can

00:36:49.686 --> 00:36:51.286 A:middle
better understand their progress

00:36:51.286 --> 00:36:53.676 A:middle
or engagement within your app.

00:36:53.996 --> 00:36:55.496 A:middle
And so, then, I know you guys

00:36:55.496 --> 00:36:56.706 A:middle
all have ideas, as well.

00:36:56.836 --> 00:36:58.186 A:middle
And once you start developing

00:36:58.186 --> 00:36:59.186 A:middle
these features and feel like

00:36:59.186 --> 00:37:00.236 A:middle
they're in the place that you

00:37:00.236 --> 00:37:01.056 A:middle
want to bring it back to the

00:37:01.056 --> 00:37:01.636 A:middle
community.

00:37:01.896 --> 00:37:03.026 A:middle
Then that's where our team will

00:37:03.026 --> 00:37:04.256 A:middle
step in and then work with you

00:37:04.256 --> 00:37:06.086 A:middle
to enhance that feature and get

00:37:06.086 --> 00:37:07.266 A:middle
it ready for our next release.

00:37:07.366 --> 00:37:09.036 A:middle
And we'll do that by providing

00:37:09.036 --> 00:37:10.776 A:middle
you with accessibility testing,

00:37:10.776 --> 00:37:13.356 A:middle
as well as localization and QA

00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:14.906 A:middle
testing across all of our

00:37:14.906 --> 00:37:16.496 A:middle
supported devices and platforms.

00:37:17.026 --> 00:37:18.046 A:middle
And once, we feel like the

00:37:18.046 --> 00:37:19.026 A:middle
feature is ready and we've

00:37:19.026 --> 00:37:20.226 A:middle
worked with you to get it there,

00:37:20.226 --> 00:37:21.606 A:middle
we will then, merge it into the

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:22.996 A:middle
framework and get it ready for

00:37:22.996 --> 00:37:23.706 A:middle
our next release.

00:37:25.136 --> 00:37:26.066 A:middle
So, I want to thank you all,

00:37:26.066 --> 00:37:28.036 A:middle
again, for contributing and to

00:37:28.036 --> 00:37:29.226 A:middle
continue to contribute.

00:37:29.226 --> 00:37:30.656 A:middle
We're really excited to see what

00:37:30.656 --> 00:37:31.836 A:middle
you do with these new features

00:37:31.836 --> 00:37:32.406 A:middle
and updates.

00:37:32.896 --> 00:37:34.406 A:middle
And so, I hope you all enjoyed

00:37:34.406 --> 00:37:36.086 A:middle
hearing about the latest updates

00:37:36.086 --> 00:37:37.416 A:middle
and features for ResearchKit and

00:37:37.416 --> 00:37:37.906 A:middle
CareKit.

00:37:37.906 --> 00:37:39.416 A:middle
And if you want to get more

00:37:39.416 --> 00:37:40.816 A:middle

As we mentioned, tomorrow, we'll

00:37:52.336 --> 00:37:53.346 A:middle
have a talk on Connecting

00:37:53.346 --> 00:37:54.536 A:middle
CareKit to the Cloud, that I

00:37:54.626 --> 00:37:55.946 A:middle
highly recommend you guys check

00:37:55.946 --> 00:37:56.226 A:middle
out.
