00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.166 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Imagine you're searching for

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:23.826 A:middle
an apartment.

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.896 A:middle
You've been on the hunt and this

00:00:25.896 --> 00:00:26.706 A:middle
one looks pretty good.

00:00:27.476 --> 00:00:28.366 A:middle
The price is right.

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:30.796 A:middle
The photos show tons of natural

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:30.966 A:middle
light.

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:31.946 A:middle
It's close to work.

00:00:32.476 --> 00:00:34.236 A:middle
So you schedule some time to

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:36.096 A:middle
stop by and check the place out.

00:00:37.096 --> 00:00:37.856 A:middle
You bike over.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.046 A:middle
Someone buzzes you in.

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:40.136 A:middle
You find the apartment door.

00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:43.736 A:middle
You give it a knock and the

00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:44.886 A:middle
landlord greets you.

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:47.066 A:middle
And before he'll even let you

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.996 A:middle
pass the front door, he has some

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:49.736 A:middle
requirements.

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.816 A:middle
He wants to see a passport, a

00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:53.546 A:middle
birth certificate, and your last

00:00:53.546 --> 00:00:54.486 A:middle
four paystubs.

00:00:54.906 --> 00:00:55.706 A:middle
Now this would be a little

00:00:55.706 --> 00:00:56.466 A:middle
ridiculous, right?

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:58.186 A:middle
You just want to check the place

00:00:58.186 --> 00:00:58.406 A:middle
out.

00:00:58.406 --> 00:00:59.416 A:middle
You're not ready to commit to

00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:01.416 A:middle
anything yet plus who knows if

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:03.216 A:middle
you're private info's safe with

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:03.596 A:middle
this guy?

00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:07.156 A:middle
First impressions matter.

00:01:08.136 --> 00:01:09.466 A:middle
They matter because they could

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.346 A:middle
also be your last.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:12.416 A:middle
People have access to millions

00:01:12.416 --> 00:01:13.466 A:middle
of apps in the App Store.

00:01:14.216 --> 00:01:15.426 A:middle
You've already passed the first

00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:16.756 A:middle
hurdle when someone installs

00:01:16.756 --> 00:01:17.116 A:middle
your app.

00:01:17.546 --> 00:01:21.406 A:middle
Great. So prevent them from

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:22.706 A:middle
backing out and deleting your

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:24.066 A:middle
app in the same way you'd

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.176 A:middle
probably be off to the next

00:01:25.176 --> 00:01:26.036 A:middle
apartment on your list.

00:01:26.156 --> 00:01:27.706 A:middle
And then instead, start things

00:01:27.706 --> 00:01:28.866 A:middle
off with a great first

00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:29.336 A:middle
impression.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:34.236 A:middle
Now suppose you're planning a

00:01:34.236 --> 00:01:36.036 A:middle
trip and a friend suggested this

00:01:36.236 --> 00:01:37.086 A:middle
travel app here.

00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:39.226 A:middle
Looks pretty good.

00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:41.226 A:middle
So the installation completes.

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:43.006 A:middle
You tap open for the first time

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.426 A:middle
and you're met with this.

00:01:46.526 --> 00:01:48.026 A:middle
Now does this look familiar?

00:01:48.856 --> 00:01:50.216 A:middle
Someone wants you to register

00:01:50.216 --> 00:01:51.506 A:middle
here but there's not much info

00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:53.086 A:middle
about what this app actually

00:01:53.086 --> 00:01:53.506 A:middle
does.

00:01:54.336 --> 00:01:55.716 A:middle
And sure you have some idea

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:56.436 A:middle
after your friend's

00:01:56.436 --> 00:01:58.506 A:middle
recommendation but when you open

00:01:58.506 --> 00:02:00.396 A:middle
the app for the first time and

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:02.256 A:middle
this is how you're greeted, it

00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:03.506 A:middle
still feels a little something

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:04.686 A:middle
like this guy.

00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:08.786 A:middle
There's a chance you might back

00:02:08.786 --> 00:02:10.236 A:middle
out, delete it, and go find

00:02:10.236 --> 00:02:10.816 A:middle
something else.

00:02:12.926 --> 00:02:15.876 A:middle
Now consider this military base

00:02:16.376 --> 00:02:18.006 A:middle
with its fortified exterior.

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:19.336 A:middle
The message to anyone on the

00:02:19.336 --> 00:02:20.256 A:middle
outside is clear.

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.196 A:middle
Stay out. Right?

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:23.716 A:middle
Compare that to Apple Union

00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:25.096 A:middle
Square in San Francisco.

00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:26.846 A:middle
The entire front of the store

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.926 A:middle
opens up to the sidewalk invited

00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:30.246 A:middle
passersby to wonder in.

00:02:31.086 --> 00:02:32.426 A:middle
And wondering is exactly what

00:02:32.426 --> 00:02:34.856 A:middle
they do because people use -- as

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:36.056 A:middle
people explore the store,

00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:37.186 A:middle
they're able to pick up and use

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:37.806 A:middle
iPhones.

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:39.336 A:middle
They might not take a new Mac

00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:40.816 A:middle
for a test drive or try on an

00:02:40.816 --> 00:02:41.476 A:middle
Apple Watch.

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:43.206 A:middle
All without obstacles or

00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:43.716 A:middle
friction.

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:46.556 A:middle
Your first launch experience

00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:47.306 A:middle
should feel just as

00:02:47.306 --> 00:02:47.946 A:middle
frictionless.

00:02:48.596 --> 00:02:49.686 A:middle
If people are greeted with an

00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:51.466 A:middle
open, interactive experience,

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:53.006 A:middle
the very first time they tap

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.626 A:middle
your icon, you're going to make

00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:55.946 A:middle
a great first impression and

00:02:55.946 --> 00:02:56.676 A:middle
keep them coming back.

00:02:57.516 --> 00:02:58.626 A:middle
So let's talk about some ways to

00:02:58.626 --> 00:02:59.226 A:middle
make that happen.

00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:02.936 A:middle
We'll be discussing some tips

00:03:02.936 --> 00:03:04.566 A:middle
for leading with content first.

00:03:05.946 --> 00:03:07.296 A:middle
How to teach new users about

00:03:07.296 --> 00:03:08.706 A:middle
your app through interaction.

00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:11.576 A:middle
And when you need to ask for

00:03:11.576 --> 00:03:12.816 A:middle
some more information upfront,

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:16.096 A:middle
some tips on timing that will

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:17.546 A:middle
add to a great user experience.

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:19.796 A:middle
So let's start with some

00:03:19.796 --> 00:03:21.226 A:middle
strategies with a content first

00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:21.656 A:middle
approach.

00:03:22.716 --> 00:03:25.396 A:middle
Let's compare our travel app to

00:03:26.066 --> 00:03:27.356 A:middle
another travel app.

00:03:27.956 --> 00:03:29.296 A:middle
Now this is Jetsetter.

00:03:29.336 --> 00:03:31.366 A:middle
And the very first time you open

00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:32.626 A:middle
Jetsetter you're immediately

00:03:32.626 --> 00:03:34.336 A:middle
greeted with this great content.

00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:36.396 A:middle
Big beautiful images.

00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:37.576 A:middle
Useful information.

00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:39.506 A:middle
You can browse this feed, of

00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:40.596 A:middle
course, or you can jump right

00:03:40.596 --> 00:03:41.456 A:middle
into search if you have

00:03:41.456 --> 00:03:42.586 A:middle
something specific in mind.

00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:45.016 A:middle
If a destination catches your

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:46.446 A:middle
attention, you can drill in for

00:03:46.446 --> 00:03:48.206 A:middle
more photos and more details.

00:03:50.806 --> 00:03:52.296 A:middle
And it's been seconds since you

00:03:52.296 --> 00:03:53.226 A:middle
first launched this app and

00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:54.226 A:middle
you're already using it like a

00:03:54.226 --> 00:03:54.536 A:middle
pro.

00:03:55.386 --> 00:03:56.236 A:middle
You're intrigued by all this

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.866 A:middle
great content and you've already

00:03:57.866 --> 00:03:59.116 A:middle
started daydreaming about laying

00:03:59.116 --> 00:03:59.876 A:middle
on this beach.

00:04:00.946 --> 00:04:01.776 A:middle
It's only when you're ready to

00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:03.516 A:middle
book the trip that you're

00:04:03.516 --> 00:04:04.566 A:middle
prompted to register.

00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:06.846 A:middle
By now, you've got a good idea

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:08.146 A:middle
of what the app has to offer.

00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:09.356 A:middle
You've seen the potential

00:04:09.356 --> 00:04:10.556 A:middle
benefits of registering.

00:04:10.986 --> 00:04:12.106 A:middle
So this feels like a more

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:13.486 A:middle
appropriate time to share more

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:13.976 A:middle
details.

00:04:17.046 --> 00:04:18.246 A:middle
If you're not convinced yet,

00:04:18.696 --> 00:04:20.596 A:middle
just compare Jetsetter with our

00:04:20.596 --> 00:04:21.666 A:middle
other travel app.

00:04:22.986 --> 00:04:24.096 A:middle
Now we've all been through some

00:04:24.096 --> 00:04:25.266 A:middle
version of that top row.

00:04:25.456 --> 00:04:26.536 A:middle
Which one of these feels more

00:04:26.536 --> 00:04:27.336 A:middle
welcoming to you?

00:04:31.326 --> 00:04:32.846 A:middle
Always lead with great content.

00:04:33.486 --> 00:04:34.526 A:middle
Show off what makes your app

00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:36.536 A:middle
great right off the bat and let

00:04:36.536 --> 00:04:37.196 A:middle
people dig in.

00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:41.156 A:middle
Now there are some situations

00:04:41.196 --> 00:04:42.226 A:middle
where a little bit of upfront

00:04:42.226 --> 00:04:43.656 A:middle
instruction might be helpful.

00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:46.556 A:middle
And I say might because before

00:04:46.556 --> 00:04:47.576 A:middle
you start incorporating some of

00:04:47.576 --> 00:04:48.716 A:middle
the tips we're about to look at,

00:04:49.116 --> 00:04:50.256 A:middle
I want you to very carefully

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:51.646 A:middle
consider whether any upfront

00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:52.816 A:middle
instruction is needed at all.

00:04:53.686 --> 00:04:55.056 A:middle
Let's take a quick look at the

00:04:55.056 --> 00:04:55.516 A:middle
phone app.

00:04:56.616 --> 00:04:58.956 A:middle
Now just imagine if we designed

00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:00.406 A:middle
this with a series of first run

00:05:00.406 --> 00:05:01.006 A:middle
tool tips.

00:05:02.056 --> 00:05:03.936 A:middle
It'll be a little ridiculous,

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:04.146 A:middle
right?

00:05:05.726 --> 00:05:07.026 A:middle
This interface is obvious.

00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:08.436 A:middle
We know how it works.

00:05:09.706 --> 00:05:10.776 A:middle
You should strive to design your

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:12.256 A:middle
interfaces to be as intuitive

00:05:12.366 --> 00:05:13.776 A:middle
and as easy to understand as

00:05:13.776 --> 00:05:14.286 A:middle
possible.

00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:16.576 A:middle
Ideally no upfront instruction

00:05:16.576 --> 00:05:17.256 A:middle
is needed at all.

00:05:17.256 --> 00:05:17.556 A:middle
All right.

00:05:18.506 --> 00:05:21.336 A:middle
Let's take a look at Lara Croft

00:05:21.336 --> 00:05:21.866 A:middle
GO.

00:05:22.806 --> 00:05:24.016 A:middle
This is your starting point

00:05:24.016 --> 00:05:24.226 A:middle
here.

00:05:24.756 --> 00:05:25.586 A:middle
No onboarding.

00:05:25.586 --> 00:05:26.706 A:middle
No instructions.

00:05:27.406 --> 00:05:28.626 A:middle
Nothing to pull your attention

00:05:28.626 --> 00:05:30.226 A:middle
from this immersive experience.

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:32.826 A:middle
You're right in the game but you

00:05:32.826 --> 00:05:33.706 A:middle
still need to learn how to play

00:05:33.706 --> 00:05:34.216 A:middle
this game.

00:05:34.446 --> 00:05:35.766 A:middle
So these first two levels are

00:05:35.766 --> 00:05:36.866 A:middle
designed to introduce you to the

00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:37.436 A:middle
basics.

00:05:39.146 --> 00:05:40.496 A:middle
Well, you only have a straight

00:05:40.496 --> 00:05:42.336 A:middle
line here and Lara looks like

00:05:42.336 --> 00:05:43.096 A:middle
she's ready to go.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:44.886 A:middle
Since there are no visible

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.686 A:middle
controls, you try swiping on the

00:05:46.686 --> 00:05:47.146 A:middle
screen.

00:05:47.726 --> 00:05:49.526 A:middle
And sure enough, she starts

00:05:49.526 --> 00:05:50.536 A:middle
moving in the direction you've

00:05:50.536 --> 00:05:50.976 A:middle
gestured.

00:05:54.186 --> 00:05:55.266 A:middle
You quickly discover you can

00:05:55.266 --> 00:05:56.416 A:middle
move up and down walls too.

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.766 A:middle
And congratulations, you've

00:05:58.766 --> 00:06:00.106 A:middle
learned the game's navigation

00:06:00.106 --> 00:06:00.696 A:middle
controls.

00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:03.436 A:middle
All right.

00:06:03.466 --> 00:06:04.566 A:middle
Now you've got this glowing tile

00:06:04.566 --> 00:06:05.286 A:middle
up ahead catching your

00:06:05.286 --> 00:06:05.726 A:middle
attention.

00:06:06.336 --> 00:06:08.166 A:middle
Options look pretty limited so

00:06:08.746 --> 00:06:13.106 A:middle
let's go check it out.

00:06:13.626 --> 00:06:15.636 A:middle
Yes, you've just completed a

00:06:15.636 --> 00:06:16.086 A:middle
level.

00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:21.206 A:middle
Now that one was pretty simple,

00:06:21.206 --> 00:06:26.526 A:middle
of course, but it's teaching you

00:06:26.526 --> 00:06:28.486 A:middle
the basics and you're already

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:29.266 A:middle
playing the game.

00:06:30.876 --> 00:06:32.546 A:middle
All right.

00:06:32.546 --> 00:06:33.486 A:middle
Level 2 starts here.

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:35.356 A:middle
It looks like your path is cut

00:06:35.356 --> 00:06:35.656 A:middle
short.

00:06:35.756 --> 00:06:36.976 A:middle
So let's try that switch.

00:06:43.216 --> 00:06:45.466 A:middle
Ah ha, the missing path fills in

00:06:45.926 --> 00:06:47.136 A:middle
and you've figured out another

00:06:47.136 --> 00:06:48.436 A:middle
important part about how this

00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:49.056 A:middle
game works.

00:06:49.206 --> 00:06:53.276 A:middle
You know, of course, things get

00:06:53.276 --> 00:06:54.486 A:middle
a lot more complex from here.

00:06:55.006 --> 00:06:56.106 A:middle
But you can start to see how

00:06:56.106 --> 00:06:57.816 A:middle
instruction can be layered into

00:06:57.816 --> 00:06:58.656 A:middle
an experience.

00:06:59.226 --> 00:07:00.456 A:middle
And again, no onboarding.

00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:02.366 A:middle
No tool tips or floating hands

00:07:02.366 --> 00:07:02.576 A:middle
here.

00:07:02.716 --> 00:07:04.186 A:middle
There are no barriers when you

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:05.526 A:middle
first play Lara Croft GO.

00:07:06.356 --> 00:07:07.666 A:middle
This approach works in all kinds

00:07:07.666 --> 00:07:08.786 A:middle
of apps not just games.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:12.006 A:middle
This is Streaks.

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:13.706 A:middle
It's a simple app designed to

00:07:13.706 --> 00:07:14.906 A:middle
help you pick up new habits.

00:07:15.506 --> 00:07:17.226 A:middle
In my case as you might be able

00:07:17.226 --> 00:07:18.976 A:middle
to guess I'm studying French and

00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:20.146 A:middle
I'm trying to make a habit of

00:07:20.146 --> 00:07:20.976 A:middle
practicing every day.

00:07:21.456 --> 00:07:22.336 A:middle
Maybe Streaks can help.

00:07:23.446 --> 00:07:25.186 A:middle
The completion of a task is

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:26.576 A:middle
represented by the filling in of

00:07:26.576 --> 00:07:26.946 A:middle
a ring.

00:07:27.876 --> 00:07:29.526 A:middle
So the first launch experience

00:07:29.526 --> 00:07:31.236 A:middle
conveys this in a clever way by

00:07:31.236 --> 00:07:32.586 A:middle
inviting you to fill in rings as

00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:33.426 A:middle
you proceed through this

00:07:33.426 --> 00:07:33.956 A:middle
introduction.

00:07:35.786 --> 00:07:37.026 A:middle
And you're led right into

00:07:37.026 --> 00:07:39.186 A:middle
creating your first habit.

00:07:39.956 --> 00:07:41.726 A:middle
So if your app requires a bit of

00:07:41.726 --> 00:07:43.376 A:middle
upfront education, it's going to

00:07:43.376 --> 00:07:44.606 A:middle
be a lot more compelling if it's

00:07:44.636 --> 00:07:46.446 A:middle
interactive and gives people

00:07:46.446 --> 00:07:47.746 A:middle
that sense of jumping right in.

00:07:51.216 --> 00:07:52.396 A:middle
Teach through interactive

00:07:52.396 --> 00:07:53.236 A:middle
experiences.

00:07:53.866 --> 00:07:57.186 A:middle
Now another place you don't want

00:07:57.186 --> 00:07:58.206 A:middle
people to get stuck is with

00:07:58.296 --> 00:07:59.286 A:middle
permission requests.

00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:00.996 A:middle
And you know what it's like to

00:08:00.996 --> 00:08:02.166 A:middle
open an app for the first time

00:08:02.166 --> 00:08:03.066 A:middle
and get hit with permission

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:03.976 A:middle
request after permission

00:08:03.976 --> 00:08:04.486 A:middle
request.

00:08:04.906 --> 00:08:05.966 A:middle
Sort of like that demanding

00:08:05.966 --> 00:08:06.996 A:middle
landlord we met earlier.

00:08:07.196 --> 00:08:08.576 A:middle
So let's look at some tips for

00:08:08.576 --> 00:08:09.186 A:middle
getting this right.

00:08:10.216 --> 00:08:12.476 A:middle
This is Strava.

00:08:13.856 --> 00:08:15.356 A:middle
Strava lets you use your iPhone

00:08:15.396 --> 00:08:17.056 A:middle
to track outdoor runs and bike

00:08:17.086 --> 00:08:17.526 A:middle
rides.

00:08:18.176 --> 00:08:19.786 A:middle
And it eventually asks for

00:08:19.786 --> 00:08:21.486 A:middle
access to your location, your

00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:23.486 A:middle
camera, your context, even

00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:25.656 A:middle
HealthKit data but it doesn't

00:08:25.656 --> 00:08:26.896 A:middle
ask for all of these right away.

00:08:27.816 --> 00:08:29.346 A:middle
Instead, Strava makes requests

00:08:29.346 --> 00:08:30.696 A:middle
on an as needed basis.

00:08:32.556 --> 00:08:33.946 A:middle
For example, it's not until

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:35.016 A:middle
you're ready to take Strava out

00:08:35.016 --> 00:08:36.256 A:middle
for a ride for the first time

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:37.726 A:middle
that you're prompted to share

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:38.356 A:middle
your location.

00:08:39.266 --> 00:08:40.946 A:middle
So you hit record down on the

00:08:40.946 --> 00:08:41.586 A:middle
bottom.

00:08:41.586 --> 00:08:42.646 A:middle
We'll get you on a ride here.

00:08:43.646 --> 00:08:44.416 A:middle
Who's ready to roll?

00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:48.696 A:middle
All right.

00:08:48.696 --> 00:08:50.516 A:middle
So you get on ride and

00:08:50.516 --> 00:08:52.026 A:middle
eventually a little while later,

00:08:52.176 --> 00:08:53.506 A:middle
you're ready to wrap things up.

00:08:53.646 --> 00:08:54.796 A:middle
We'll make it a short ride.

00:08:56.316 --> 00:08:58.246 A:middle
So you stop the ride and you tap

00:08:58.246 --> 00:08:58.646 A:middle
save.

00:08:59.896 --> 00:09:01.256 A:middle
Now when you're saving a ride,

00:09:01.586 --> 00:09:02.646 A:middle
you have the option to add more

00:09:02.646 --> 00:09:04.976 A:middle
details including a photo.

00:09:08.796 --> 00:09:10.016 A:middle
And it's only when you tap add a

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.706 A:middle
photo that you're prompted for

00:09:11.706 --> 00:09:12.946 A:middle
access to your photo library.

00:09:12.946 --> 00:09:15.716 A:middle
And this is another great

00:09:15.716 --> 00:09:17.556 A:middle
example of a permission request

00:09:17.606 --> 00:09:18.926 A:middle
that's right in context.

00:09:19.376 --> 00:09:20.446 A:middle
So you immediately see the

00:09:20.446 --> 00:09:21.966 A:middle
benefit and no additional

00:09:21.966 --> 00:09:23.176 A:middle
explanation is necessary.

00:09:25.426 --> 00:09:26.876 A:middle
And it's the same situation when

00:09:26.876 --> 00:09:28.376 A:middle
looking for friends on Strava in

00:09:28.376 --> 00:09:29.136 A:middle
your contacts.

00:09:31.176 --> 00:09:32.886 A:middle
The app requests permissions on

00:09:32.886 --> 00:09:33.966 A:middle
a need to know basis.

00:09:34.566 --> 00:09:36.046 A:middle
So you retain a sense of control

00:09:36.046 --> 00:09:37.866 A:middle
over both the experience and

00:09:37.866 --> 00:09:39.496 A:middle
your private data.

00:09:42.036 --> 00:09:43.656 A:middle
Now there are a few apps out

00:09:43.656 --> 00:09:45.266 A:middle
there that can't offer any value

00:09:45.266 --> 00:09:46.186 A:middle
without some sort of

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:46.776 A:middle
permissions.

00:09:47.506 --> 00:09:48.576 A:middle
This is Transit.

00:09:49.076 --> 00:09:50.546 A:middle
It lists departures of nearby

00:09:50.546 --> 00:09:52.366 A:middle
buses and trains ordered based

00:09:52.366 --> 00:09:53.486 A:middle
on proximity to your current

00:09:53.486 --> 00:09:53.976 A:middle
location.

00:09:54.306 --> 00:09:56.116 A:middle
I live in San Francisco and I

00:09:56.116 --> 00:09:57.546 A:middle
use this one all the time to get

00:09:57.546 --> 00:09:57.866 A:middle
around.

00:09:59.816 --> 00:10:00.986 A:middle
Of course it wouldn't be able to

00:10:00.986 --> 00:10:02.596 A:middle
provide this data without your

00:10:02.596 --> 00:10:03.236 A:middle
location.

00:10:03.856 --> 00:10:05.226 A:middle
So the first time you launch the

00:10:05.226 --> 00:10:07.326 A:middle
app, you are prompted to share

00:10:07.326 --> 00:10:08.016 A:middle
your location.

00:10:08.876 --> 00:10:10.706 A:middle
And as soon as you tap allow,

00:10:10.706 --> 00:10:12.376 A:middle
the map zooms in and you're

00:10:12.376 --> 00:10:13.786 A:middle
presented with a list of nearby

00:10:13.786 --> 00:10:15.086 A:middle
routes and departure times.

00:10:15.916 --> 00:10:17.446 A:middle
So you immediately see the value

00:10:17.446 --> 00:10:19.146 A:middle
Transit will provide in exchange

00:10:19.146 --> 00:10:20.176 A:middle
for this information.

00:10:21.866 --> 00:10:26.496 A:middle
So remember, ensure people

00:10:26.496 --> 00:10:28.226 A:middle
understand the value of sharing

00:10:28.226 --> 00:10:29.296 A:middle
their private data with you

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.436 A:middle
ideally before you ask for it.

00:10:32.496 --> 00:10:33.476 A:middle
Once that permission has been

00:10:33.476 --> 00:10:35.606 A:middle
granted, reinforce the decision

00:10:35.606 --> 00:10:36.976 A:middle
by showing off the benefits

00:10:36.976 --> 00:10:38.486 A:middle
you'll provide with that data.

00:10:39.206 --> 00:10:40.686 A:middle
Only ask for what's needed when

00:10:40.686 --> 00:10:41.146 A:middle
it's needed.

00:10:43.516 --> 00:10:45.206 A:middle
Follow these tips and I promise

00:10:45.206 --> 00:10:45.956 A:middle
you'll make a great first

00:10:45.956 --> 00:10:46.426 A:middle
impression.

00:10:46.916 --> 00:10:47.206 A:middle
Thank you.
