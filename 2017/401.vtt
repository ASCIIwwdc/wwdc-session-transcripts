00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:21.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:22.666 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone.

00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:24.756 A:middle
Sorry about the technical

00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:26.656 A:middle
difficulties, but we're ready.

00:00:26.886 --> 00:00:28.156 A:middle
[laughing] All right, so I'm

00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:29.476 A:middle
Sarah Roddy and welcome to

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:31.506 A:middle
Localizing with Xcode 9 session.

00:00:31.506 --> 00:00:32.926 A:middle
And today, with my colleagues Ia

00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:34.236 A:middle
and Chris, who would like to

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:35.806 A:middle
talk to you about some exciting

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:37.266 A:middle
new improvements we made to the

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.456 A:middle
localization process in Xcode 9.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:40.906 A:middle
So let's get started.

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:45.786 A:middle
Around the world, you have so

00:00:45.786 --> 00:00:47.506 A:middle
many people who are looking to

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.126 A:middle
access and use your great

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:51.206 A:middle
applications, but they can't do

00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:52.586 A:middle
that if you don't give them the

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.526 A:middle
ability to use your apps in

00:00:54.526 --> 00:00:55.486 A:middle
their native language.

00:00:57.286 --> 00:00:59.206 A:middle
And your app can easily access

00:00:59.206 --> 00:01:00.826 A:middle
this global audience by

00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:02.516 A:middle
following some simple steps and

00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:03.336 A:middle
best practices.

00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:05.356 A:middle
And, in today's session, we will

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:07.666 A:middle
talk about how Xcode makes it so

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.246 A:middle
easy for you to add new

00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:11.476 A:middle
languages to make your app look

00:01:11.726 --> 00:01:13.376 A:middle
and feel local, which will allow

00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:14.236 A:middle
you to go global.

00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:17.146 A:middle
So there are three main topics

00:01:17.146 --> 00:01:18.316 A:middle
we will be covering today.

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:20.726 A:middle
First, we will start with how to

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:23.806 A:middle
make your code world ready, then

00:01:23.806 --> 00:01:24.726 A:middle
we will walk you through the

00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:26.396 A:middle
localization process in Xcode

00:01:26.396 --> 00:01:28.356 A:middle
and introduce new features we

00:01:28.356 --> 00:01:29.556 A:middle
added in Xcode 9.

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:32.006 A:middle
Finally, and through the

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:33.806 A:middle
presentation, we will talk about

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.436 A:middle
testing and give you some best

00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:37.116 A:middle
practices to make sure that your

00:01:37.116 --> 00:01:39.426 A:middle
app works and looks great in all

00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:40.656 A:middle
languages that you support.

00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:43.036 A:middle
So let's start with

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:43.856 A:middle
internationalization.

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:49.666 A:middle
So internationalization is the

00:01:49.736 --> 00:01:51.296 A:middle
process of designing your

00:01:51.296 --> 00:01:53.436 A:middle
software so it can be adapted to

00:01:53.436 --> 00:01:55.496 A:middle
different languages and regions

00:01:55.806 --> 00:01:57.346 A:middle
without making code changes

00:01:57.346 --> 00:01:59.336 A:middle
every single time you are adding

00:01:59.336 --> 00:02:00.926 A:middle
a new language to your app.

00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:02.936 A:middle
So the point here is it

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:04.836 A:middle
shouldn't matter which language

00:02:04.936 --> 00:02:06.256 A:middle
your app is running in.

00:02:06.796 --> 00:02:08.296 A:middle
If the language has short text

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:12.196 A:middle
or long text or tall text or

00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:14.336 A:middle
even text or layout that flows

00:02:14.336 --> 00:02:16.326 A:middle
from right to left, your app

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:17.526 A:middle
should be able to adapt

00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:19.046 A:middle
dynamically to all these

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:19.686 A:middle
scenarios.

00:02:20.196 --> 00:02:22.996 A:middle
And the first step in

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:25.456 A:middle
internationalization is managing

00:02:25.456 --> 00:02:26.116 A:middle
your strings.

00:02:26.786 --> 00:02:30.006 A:middle
Your app will be localized by

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:32.036 A:middle
translators who would be working

00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:34.376 A:middle
with your strings and in this

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:35.696 A:middle
localized string is there to

00:02:35.696 --> 00:02:37.776 A:middle
make it easier for you to create

00:02:37.956 --> 00:02:39.706 A:middle
localizable content for your

00:02:39.706 --> 00:02:41.186 A:middle
translators as well as

00:02:41.226 --> 00:02:42.716 A:middle
displaying the right text at the

00:02:42.816 --> 00:02:43.316 A:middle
right time.

00:02:44.116 --> 00:02:45.796 A:middle
So if your strings are coming

00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:47.606 A:middle
from a storyboard or a zip file

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:49.376 A:middle
they're localizable by default,

00:02:49.376 --> 00:02:50.536 A:middle
so we don't need to worry about

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:50.766 A:middle
those.

00:02:51.226 --> 00:02:52.596 A:middle
But sometimes you might have

00:02:52.646 --> 00:02:54.426 A:middle
some strings that are defined in

00:02:54.426 --> 00:02:55.856 A:middle
your source code that will be

00:02:55.856 --> 00:02:57.226 A:middle
displayed to the user, like

00:02:57.226 --> 00:02:59.336 A:middle
error messages or notifications;

00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:00.606 A:middle
if you would like to notify your

00:03:00.606 --> 00:03:01.656 A:middle
users about something.

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:03.296 A:middle
And you want to make sure that

00:03:03.296 --> 00:03:04.496 A:middle
this translator is also

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:05.146 A:middle
localizable.

00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:07.106 A:middle
And to do that you just need to

00:03:07.106 --> 00:03:08.796 A:middle
wrap those strings with NS

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:09.716 A:middle
Localized String.

00:03:10.786 --> 00:03:12.826 A:middle
In addition to that you can use

00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:14.886 A:middle
NS Localized String as a format

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:17.196 A:middle
string with localized language

00:03:17.246 --> 00:03:19.116 A:middle
format to get a localized and a

00:03:19.196 --> 00:03:20.076 A:middle
formatted string.

00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:22.386 A:middle
So here let's go through a quick

00:03:22.386 --> 00:03:23.276 A:middle
example together.

00:03:24.276 --> 00:03:25.796 A:middle
So here they have a label.

00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:27.796 A:middle
When I set its text to a string

00:03:27.826 --> 00:03:28.806 A:middle
called population.

00:03:29.196 --> 00:03:30.976 A:middle
So again, my string is hardcoded

00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:32.436 A:middle
and is not localizable.

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:34.966 A:middle
To make it localizable, you just

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:36.516 A:middle
need to wrap it with NS

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:37.306 A:middle
Localized String.

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:38.836 A:middle
And as you can see here on the

00:03:38.836 --> 00:03:40.596 A:middle
screen, NS Localized String

00:03:40.646 --> 00:03:43.016 A:middle
takes two arguments, your string

00:03:43.016 --> 00:03:43.766 A:middle
and a comment.

00:03:44.376 --> 00:03:45.976 A:middle
Comments here are really, really

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:47.156 A:middle
important to provide to your

00:03:47.156 --> 00:03:49.086 A:middle
translators so they have context

00:03:49.086 --> 00:03:50.296 A:middle
about the string they are

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.006 A:middle
translating.

00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:54.106 A:middle
And I would say most of the time

00:03:54.106 --> 00:03:55.446 A:middle
you just need to use NS

00:03:55.516 --> 00:03:57.666 A:middle
Localized String, but in some

00:03:57.666 --> 00:03:59.086 A:middle
cases when you're working on a

00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:00.826 A:middle
framework or a shared component

00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:02.636 A:middle
you might want to use NS

00:04:02.636 --> 00:04:04.156 A:middle
Localized String from table

00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:06.146 A:middle
where you specify the table name

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:07.406 A:middle
where your strings are coming

00:04:07.406 --> 00:04:07.796 A:middle
from.

00:04:08.326 --> 00:04:11.526 A:middle
And as I mentioned before, you

00:04:11.526 --> 00:04:13.426 A:middle
can also combine NS Localized

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:14.456 A:middle
String with Localized String

00:04:14.456 --> 00:04:17.176 A:middle
with Format, where NS Localized

00:04:17.176 --> 00:04:18.306 A:middle
String is a format string.

00:04:18.456 --> 00:04:19.906 A:middle
And in this case it's really,

00:04:19.906 --> 00:04:21.276 A:middle
really critical that you provide

00:04:21.276 --> 00:04:22.306 A:middle
those comments for your

00:04:22.306 --> 00:04:24.346 A:middle
translators so they have context

00:04:24.346 --> 00:04:25.626 A:middle
about the string they are

00:04:25.656 --> 00:04:26.266 A:middle
translating.

00:04:27.336 --> 00:04:30.946 A:middle
Then at run time NS Localized

00:04:30.946 --> 00:04:32.116 A:middle
String will determine the

00:04:32.176 --> 00:04:34.196 A:middle
preferred language of the user

00:04:34.686 --> 00:04:36.596 A:middle
and find the corresponding

00:04:36.596 --> 00:04:38.046 A:middle
localizable string files.

00:04:38.506 --> 00:04:39.876 A:middle
As you can see here, this is an

00:04:39.876 --> 00:04:41.986 A:middle
example of a localizable string

00:04:41.986 --> 00:04:43.796 A:middle
files coming from the French

00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:45.756 A:middle
localization projects and it

00:04:45.756 --> 00:04:47.306 A:middle
contains all your localizable

00:04:47.306 --> 00:04:48.266 A:middle
strings, the one that you

00:04:48.266 --> 00:04:49.976 A:middle
wrapped with NS Localized String

00:04:50.226 --> 00:04:51.486 A:middle
as well as the comments that you

00:04:51.486 --> 00:04:51.896 A:middle
provided.

00:04:51.896 --> 00:04:53.896 A:middle
And this is the information that

00:04:53.896 --> 00:04:54.586 A:middle
will be provided to your

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:54.976 A:middle
translator.

00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:00.196 A:middle
And if you're using Objective

00:05:00.196 --> 00:05:01.936 A:middle
Senior App you can run the

00:05:01.936 --> 00:05:03.736 A:middle
static analyzer to find

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:05.276 A:middle
localizability problems in your

00:05:05.276 --> 00:05:07.796 A:middle
code, like if you forgot to make

00:05:07.796 --> 00:05:09.516 A:middle
a string localizable or if you

00:05:09.516 --> 00:05:10.806 A:middle
forgot to add a comment to a

00:05:10.806 --> 00:05:13.356 A:middle
localizable string you can run

00:05:13.356 --> 00:05:14.776 A:middle
the static analyzer and you get

00:05:14.776 --> 00:05:16.526 A:middle
warnings that will show you what

00:05:16.526 --> 00:05:17.966 A:middle
these problems are and you can

00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:19.146 A:middle
fix them right on your code.

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:20.786 A:middle
If you'd like to learn more

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:22.366 A:middle
about the static analyzer please

00:05:22.396 --> 00:05:23.886 A:middle
check out this talk from last

00:05:23.886 --> 00:05:23.976 A:middle
year.

00:05:28.126 --> 00:05:29.506 A:middle
Another thing that your app

00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:31.036 A:middle
should handle well when it comes

00:05:31.096 --> 00:05:33.126 A:middle
to localization is working with

00:05:33.126 --> 00:05:35.056 A:middle
different visual representations

00:05:35.056 --> 00:05:37.566 A:middle
of date, time, numbers, et

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:38.006 A:middle
cetera.

00:05:38.926 --> 00:05:41.596 A:middle
For example, 12-hour time format

00:05:41.746 --> 00:05:43.716 A:middle
is a standard format we use here

00:05:43.716 --> 00:05:45.466 A:middle
in the US, but you want to make

00:05:45.466 --> 00:05:47.556 A:middle
sure that a user who's using

00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:49.586 A:middle
your app in France, for example,

00:05:49.876 --> 00:05:51.316 A:middle
is getting 24-hour time

00:05:51.316 --> 00:05:52.686 A:middle
formatting set because this is

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:53.916 A:middle
the default format used there.

00:05:55.166 --> 00:05:58.036 A:middle
And we provide a variety of very

00:05:58.086 --> 00:05:59.456 A:middle
powerful formatters that will

00:05:59.456 --> 00:06:01.166 A:middle
let you handle the complexity of

00:06:01.166 --> 00:06:03.566 A:middle
data formatting and regions, but

00:06:03.566 --> 00:06:04.826 A:middle
just to give you an example on

00:06:04.826 --> 00:06:06.466 A:middle
how formatters work, let's take

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:07.726 A:middle
a look at a date formatter

00:06:07.726 --> 00:06:07.966 A:middle
example.

00:06:12.046 --> 00:06:13.346 A:middle
So here let's say you want to

00:06:13.346 --> 00:06:15.446 A:middle
display a full date format in

00:06:15.446 --> 00:06:16.426 A:middle
your app.

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:20.136 A:middle
So instead of setting a date

00:06:20.136 --> 00:06:21.776 A:middle
format string that is specific

00:06:21.836 --> 00:06:23.766 A:middle
to a region or a country that

00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:25.746 A:middle
has a specific order, we

00:06:25.746 --> 00:06:27.566 A:middle
recommend that you use date

00:06:27.566 --> 00:06:27.986 A:middle
style.

00:06:29.136 --> 00:06:30.396 A:middle
This formatter has different

00:06:30.396 --> 00:06:31.956 A:middle
styles that you can choose from,

00:06:33.236 --> 00:06:34.296 A:middle
but since here we want to

00:06:34.296 --> 00:06:35.896 A:middle
display a full date format I'm

00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:37.306 A:middle
setting my date style to full.

00:06:37.686 --> 00:06:39.066 A:middle
So with that you are making sure

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:40.486 A:middle
that your date is formatted

00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:42.686 A:middle
correctly in all regions in the

00:06:42.686 --> 00:06:42.986 A:middle
world.

00:06:43.496 --> 00:06:45.956 A:middle
As you can see on the screen,

00:06:45.956 --> 00:06:47.226 A:middle
there are differences between

00:06:47.226 --> 00:06:48.806 A:middle
the date format in the US and

00:06:48.806 --> 00:06:50.136 A:middle
the date format in France, like

00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:51.356 A:middle
the French date does not have

00:06:51.356 --> 00:06:53.076 A:middle
any commas, the month name is

00:06:53.076 --> 00:06:54.876 A:middle
not capitalized, the day of the

00:06:54.876 --> 00:06:56.056 A:middle
month comes before the month

00:06:56.056 --> 00:06:57.526 A:middle
itself, and this would not be

00:06:57.526 --> 00:07:00.006 A:middle
achievable if you have pasted in

00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:01.856 A:middle
a date format instead of a date

00:07:01.856 --> 00:07:01.976 A:middle
style.

00:07:05.106 --> 00:07:06.736 A:middle
In addition to date formatter,

00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:09.006 A:middle
we have a series of formatters

00:07:09.176 --> 00:07:10.976 A:middle
for common data types available

00:07:10.976 --> 00:07:11.776 A:middle
in foundation.

00:07:12.096 --> 00:07:13.226 A:middle
If you'd like to learn more

00:07:13.226 --> 00:07:14.576 A:middle
about formatters please check

00:07:14.576 --> 00:07:15.626 A:middle
out these two great talks from

00:07:15.626 --> 00:07:15.896 A:middle
last year.

00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:22.236 A:middle
Finally, you want to make sure

00:07:22.236 --> 00:07:23.656 A:middle
that your user interface is

00:07:23.726 --> 00:07:25.476 A:middle
flexible and looks nice and

00:07:25.476 --> 00:07:26.986 A:middle
beautiful in all languages that

00:07:26.986 --> 00:07:30.166 A:middle
you support and to do that the

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:31.426 A:middle
process is really simple.

00:07:32.066 --> 00:07:33.166 A:middle
We just need to use base

00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:35.176 A:middle
internationalization and auto

00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:35.506 A:middle
layout.

00:07:36.186 --> 00:07:37.486 A:middle
So let's talk about base

00:07:37.486 --> 00:07:38.656 A:middle
internationalization for a

00:07:38.656 --> 00:07:39.086 A:middle
moment.

00:07:39.766 --> 00:07:42.196 A:middle
So by enabling base

00:07:42.196 --> 00:07:43.486 A:middle
internationalization in your

00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:46.066 A:middle
project, Xcode modifies your

00:07:46.136 --> 00:07:47.996 A:middle
projects for Destructor and

00:07:47.996 --> 00:07:50.286 A:middle
separates your UI from your

00:07:50.286 --> 00:07:53.126 A:middle
strings, which means any file

00:07:53.126 --> 00:07:54.526 A:middle
that is related to your user

00:07:54.526 --> 00:07:56.816 A:middle
interface, like a zip file or a

00:07:56.896 --> 00:07:59.016 A:middle
storyboard file, will be stored

00:07:59.116 --> 00:07:59.596 A:middle
in base [inaudible].

00:07:59.596 --> 00:08:03.376 A:middle
While your strings, either if

00:08:03.376 --> 00:08:04.176 A:middle
they are coming from a

00:08:04.176 --> 00:08:06.846 A:middle
storyboard file or if they are

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:07.976 A:middle
in your code that you wrapped

00:08:07.976 --> 00:08:09.516 A:middle
with NS Localized String, they

00:08:09.516 --> 00:08:11.316 A:middle
will be stored in the specific

00:08:11.316 --> 00:08:14.426 A:middle
language folders so that way you

00:08:14.426 --> 00:08:15.976 A:middle
only have one set of user

00:08:15.976 --> 00:08:18.146 A:middle
interface instead of duplicating

00:08:18.146 --> 00:08:19.566 A:middle
your UI every single time you

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:21.056 A:middle
are creating a new language in

00:08:21.846 --> 00:08:22.946 A:middle
your app.

00:08:23.176 --> 00:08:25.356 A:middle
And base internationalization is

00:08:25.356 --> 00:08:27.306 A:middle
enabled by default since Xcode

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:27.666 A:middle
5.

00:08:27.746 --> 00:08:29.166 A:middle
So if you have an older project

00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:30.216 A:middle
that you want to localize,

00:08:30.546 --> 00:08:31.806 A:middle
please make sure that you enable

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:31.976 A:middle
it there.

00:08:36.046 --> 00:08:36.956 A:middle
And you might be already

00:08:36.956 --> 00:08:38.866 A:middle
familiar with auto layout or

00:08:38.866 --> 00:08:39.966 A:middle
you're already using it to

00:08:39.966 --> 00:08:42.056 A:middle
support different presentations

00:08:42.056 --> 00:08:43.576 A:middle
of your app or different screen

00:08:43.576 --> 00:08:45.896 A:middle
sizes, but auto layout is also a

00:08:45.896 --> 00:08:48.296 A:middle
critical technology to use for

00:08:48.296 --> 00:08:49.076 A:middle
localization.

00:08:49.756 --> 00:08:51.356 A:middle
So by using auto layout you are

00:08:51.356 --> 00:08:52.806 A:middle
making sure that your app is

00:08:52.876 --> 00:08:54.576 A:middle
flexible and it can adapt to

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:55.696 A:middle
different string lengths and

00:08:55.696 --> 00:08:57.186 A:middle
different configurations of your

00:08:57.736 --> 00:08:57.806 A:middle
app.

00:08:58.856 --> 00:09:00.866 A:middle
And new in Xcode 9 we are

00:09:00.866 --> 00:09:02.626 A:middle
introducing new interface

00:09:02.626 --> 00:09:04.476 A:middle
builder localization warnings to

00:09:04.476 --> 00:09:06.106 A:middle
validate your constraints for

00:09:06.106 --> 00:09:08.296 A:middle
localization, which means when

00:09:08.296 --> 00:09:10.186 A:middle
you are working on your UI and

00:09:10.186 --> 00:09:11.626 A:middle
your storyboard file or your zip

00:09:11.626 --> 00:09:12.816 A:middle
file and you're setting up these

00:09:12.866 --> 00:09:14.346 A:middle
constraints and they are not

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:16.046 A:middle
localization friendly you will

00:09:16.046 --> 00:09:17.576 A:middle
get this warning as well as

00:09:17.616 --> 00:09:19.336 A:middle
suggestions on how to fix them.

00:09:20.396 --> 00:09:21.556 A:middle
And new interface builder

00:09:21.556 --> 00:09:23.336 A:middle
warnings will be available in

00:09:23.336 --> 00:09:24.176 A:middle
the future seat.

00:09:26.676 --> 00:09:28.726 A:middle
Additionally we are introducing

00:09:28.726 --> 00:09:30.166 A:middle
an Xcode -- 9 used to the

00:09:30.166 --> 00:09:32.376 A:middle
localization options for you to

00:09:32.376 --> 00:09:33.576 A:middle
simulate a localized

00:09:33.576 --> 00:09:34.156 A:middle
environment.

00:09:34.606 --> 00:09:36.466 A:middle
So instead of having a real

00:09:36.466 --> 00:09:38.336 A:middle
strings, translated strings, to

00:09:38.336 --> 00:09:39.836 A:middle
see how they look like in your

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:41.196 A:middle
app you can just use one of

00:09:41.196 --> 00:09:42.766 A:middle
these pseudo localization

00:09:42.766 --> 00:09:44.196 A:middle
options that we are providing.

00:09:44.526 --> 00:09:45.896 A:middle
So, in Xcode 9, we have new

00:09:45.896 --> 00:09:47.346 A:middle
options for accented Latin

00:09:47.416 --> 00:09:49.366 A:middle
strings for a fixed strings and

00:09:49.366 --> 00:09:50.596 A:middle
new options for right to left

00:09:50.596 --> 00:09:51.076 A:middle
languages.

00:09:51.126 --> 00:09:53.786 A:middle
And with that I would like to

00:09:53.786 --> 00:09:56.236 A:middle
call Ia on stage to give you a

00:09:56.236 --> 00:09:57.776 A:middle
demo about how to prepare your

00:09:57.856 --> 00:09:58.846 A:middle
app for localization.

00:09:59.116 --> 00:09:59.496 A:middle
Thank you.

00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:06.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:07.096 --> 00:10:07.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Sarah.

00:10:13.626 --> 00:10:15.576 A:middle
Hi. I'm Ia and today I want to

00:10:15.576 --> 00:10:17.136 A:middle
show you this really cool app

00:10:17.136 --> 00:10:18.266 A:middle
I've been working on called

00:10:18.266 --> 00:10:19.446 A:middle
International Effects.

00:10:20.026 --> 00:10:21.596 A:middle
As you see on the screen, my UI

00:10:21.596 --> 00:10:23.076 A:middle
consists mostly of this table

00:10:23.076 --> 00:10:25.146 A:middle
view and a user can go and

00:10:25.146 --> 00:10:26.946 A:middle
select a country or territory

00:10:26.946 --> 00:10:28.906 A:middle
from this list and they'll see

00:10:28.906 --> 00:10:30.126 A:middle
some information about it like

00:10:30.126 --> 00:10:32.776 A:middle
the flag, the population, and

00:10:32.776 --> 00:10:34.116 A:middle
even the language population.

00:10:35.566 --> 00:10:36.946 A:middle
So I made sure my app looks

00:10:37.046 --> 00:10:38.386 A:middle
beautiful in English and I'm

00:10:38.386 --> 00:10:40.366 A:middle
happy with the way it looks, but

00:10:40.646 --> 00:10:42.466 A:middle
now I want to internationalize

00:10:42.466 --> 00:10:43.876 A:middle
it so it can be ready for my

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:44.966 A:middle
first localization.

00:10:45.676 --> 00:10:46.856 A:middle
And to do that I'm going to

00:10:46.856 --> 00:10:48.576 A:middle
follow the steps that Sarah just

00:10:48.576 --> 00:10:49.906 A:middle
showed us in her slides.

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:51.936 A:middle
So the first thing I want to do

00:10:51.936 --> 00:10:53.306 A:middle
is my strings management.

00:10:54.096 --> 00:10:56.016 A:middle
I'm loading all of these strings

00:10:56.016 --> 00:10:57.646 A:middle
in my table cells in code.

00:10:57.646 --> 00:10:59.576 A:middle
So I'm going to open my Xcode

00:10:59.576 --> 00:10:59.976 A:middle
project.

00:11:06.546 --> 00:11:08.626 A:middle
And in my table view controller,

00:11:08.736 --> 00:11:10.646 A:middle
in my cell for wrote indexpath

00:11:10.646 --> 00:11:12.586 A:middle
function I want to make sure I

00:11:12.586 --> 00:11:14.366 A:middle
don't have any hardcoded strings

00:11:14.366 --> 00:11:16.406 A:middle
that I'm loading into my UI.

00:11:16.406 --> 00:11:18.266 A:middle
And instead I want to replace

00:11:18.266 --> 00:11:20.586 A:middle
them with a call to NS Localized

00:11:20.586 --> 00:11:20.866 A:middle
String.

00:11:21.606 --> 00:11:22.766 A:middle
And I'll pass in my English

00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:24.396 A:middle
string and I'll also give a

00:11:24.396 --> 00:11:25.206 A:middle
helpful comment.

00:11:25.366 --> 00:11:27.766 A:middle
So; "Label preceding the

00:11:27.766 --> 00:11:29.466 A:middle
selected territory."

00:11:29.796 --> 00:11:32.326 A:middle
And then I also went ahead and

00:11:32.326 --> 00:11:33.596 A:middle
made sure I'm calling NS

00:11:33.646 --> 00:11:35.336 A:middle
Localized String for all the

00:11:35.336 --> 00:11:36.656 A:middle
other text I'm loading in code.

00:11:37.746 --> 00:11:39.586 A:middle
So the next thing I want to do

00:11:39.586 --> 00:11:41.666 A:middle
is I also want to make sure I'm

00:11:41.666 --> 00:11:43.236 A:middle
displaying and representing data

00:11:43.236 --> 00:11:44.646 A:middle
correctly for different locales.

00:11:45.476 --> 00:11:48.406 A:middle
So in this case my data are

00:11:48.406 --> 00:11:50.086 A:middle
mostly these numbers that you're

00:11:50.086 --> 00:11:51.076 A:middle
seeing on the right side.

00:11:51.646 --> 00:11:52.956 A:middle
And numbers are displayed

00:11:52.956 --> 00:11:53.966 A:middle
differently in different

00:11:53.966 --> 00:11:54.416 A:middle
countries.

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:57.176 A:middle
So to format them correctly I'm

00:11:57.326 --> 00:11:59.086 A:middle
going to use a number formatter.

00:12:00.526 --> 00:12:02.676 A:middle
Number formatter is similar to

00:12:03.596 --> 00:12:04.976 A:middle
date formatter that Sarah showed

00:12:04.976 --> 00:12:06.716 A:middle
us earlier, except, of course,

00:12:06.756 --> 00:12:08.566 A:middle
it's used to format numbers

00:12:08.566 --> 00:12:09.306 A:middle
instead of dates.

00:12:10.296 --> 00:12:12.316 A:middle
So for population I can simply

00:12:12.316 --> 00:12:13.976 A:middle
set my formatter's number style

00:12:13.976 --> 00:12:16.066 A:middle
to decimal and I set "uses

00:12:16.066 --> 00:12:17.396 A:middle
grouping separator" to "true,"

00:12:17.896 --> 00:12:19.426 A:middle
which makes it easier to read by

00:12:19.426 --> 00:12:20.636 A:middle
separating the number by the

00:12:20.636 --> 00:12:21.906 A:middle
thousands, and that's because

00:12:21.936 --> 00:12:23.406 A:middle
population tends to be a large

00:12:23.446 --> 00:12:24.000 A:middle
number.

00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:30.246 A:middle
For GDP I can also use a number

00:12:30.246 --> 00:12:31.996 A:middle
formatter, except this time I

00:12:31.996 --> 00:12:33.196 A:middle
would set the number style to

00:12:33.196 --> 00:12:35.396 A:middle
currency and the currency code

00:12:35.396 --> 00:12:36.896 A:middle
to US dollars because our data

00:12:36.896 --> 00:12:38.286 A:middle
is in US dollars.

00:12:38.876 --> 00:12:41.936 A:middle
And finally, for the literacy

00:12:41.936 --> 00:12:43.666 A:middle
percentage cell, as well as my

00:12:43.666 --> 00:12:45.696 A:middle
language population, I set the

00:12:45.696 --> 00:12:48.636 A:middle
number style to percent and I

00:12:48.906 --> 00:12:50.446 A:middle
give it a maximum and minimum

00:12:50.446 --> 00:12:51.896 A:middle
fraction digits to make sure it

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:52.646 A:middle
looks consistent.

00:12:54.216 --> 00:12:55.266 A:middle
So now that my strings are

00:12:55.266 --> 00:12:57.206 A:middle
localizable and I'm displaying

00:12:57.206 --> 00:12:58.816 A:middle
my numbers -- and I'm formatting

00:12:58.816 --> 00:13:00.726 A:middle
my numbers correctly, the next

00:13:00.726 --> 00:13:02.156 A:middle
thing I want to do is make sure

00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:03.966 A:middle
my user interface is also ready.

00:13:04.856 --> 00:13:07.516 A:middle
And to do that I'm going to open

00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:10.226 A:middle
my main storyboard and I want to

00:13:10.226 --> 00:13:12.526 A:middle
show you how you can use pseudo

00:13:12.526 --> 00:13:14.316 A:middle
languages in Interface Builder

00:13:14.316 --> 00:13:17.276 A:middle
Preview to test your app for

00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:18.396 A:middle
localization.

00:13:19.236 --> 00:13:20.986 A:middle
So first I'll click on the top

00:13:20.986 --> 00:13:22.766 A:middle
right corner on the Assistant

00:13:22.766 --> 00:13:23.876 A:middle
Editor icon.

00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:26.536 A:middle
And then under this dropdown I

00:13:26.536 --> 00:13:28.136 A:middle
want to choose "preview" and

00:13:29.076 --> 00:13:30.326 A:middle
basically it's showing me a

00:13:30.326 --> 00:13:31.716 A:middle
preview of my storyboard.

00:13:32.856 --> 00:13:34.336 A:middle
And on the bottom, right corner

00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:38.436 A:middle
I get a language chooser and if

00:13:38.436 --> 00:13:39.756 A:middle
I had any localizations on my

00:13:39.756 --> 00:13:41.836 A:middle
project I would see those here,

00:13:42.216 --> 00:13:43.996 A:middle
but in this case it's showing me

00:13:44.426 --> 00:13:46.226 A:middle
all the pseudo language options

00:13:46.226 --> 00:13:47.346 A:middle
I can use in the preview.

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:49.516 A:middle
So new in Xcode 9 we've

00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:50.846 A:middle
introduced a fixed pseudo

00:13:50.846 --> 00:13:51.226 A:middle
language.

00:13:51.226 --> 00:13:52.486 A:middle
So I'm going to select that to

00:13:52.486 --> 00:13:53.146 A:middle
see what it does.

00:13:54.326 --> 00:13:55.806 A:middle
As you can see it simply added

00:13:55.806 --> 00:13:57.226 A:middle
those square brackets and the

00:13:57.226 --> 00:13:58.776 A:middle
pound symbol before and after

00:13:58.776 --> 00:13:59.446 A:middle
each string.

00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:02.166 A:middle
And that makes it really easy to

00:14:02.166 --> 00:14:03.736 A:middle
spot if something is clipping or

00:14:03.736 --> 00:14:05.326 A:middle
not fitting in my UI because

00:14:05.566 --> 00:14:06.706 A:middle
those symbols would be missing.

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:08.706 A:middle
So in this case it looks like my

00:14:08.706 --> 00:14:10.006 A:middle
button on the bottom doesn't

00:14:10.006 --> 00:14:11.316 A:middle
have the pound symbol and that's

00:14:11.316 --> 00:14:12.856 A:middle
the first thing I saw, but if

00:14:12.856 --> 00:14:14.096 A:middle
you take a closer look, even --

00:14:14.096 --> 00:14:15.646 A:middle
the y is clipping in "play."

00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:17.436 A:middle
So I'm going to go back to my

00:14:17.436 --> 00:14:19.746 A:middle
storyboard and see why that is.

00:14:21.156 --> 00:14:22.606 A:middle
And it looks like I have a fixed

00:14:22.606 --> 00:14:24.196 A:middle
width constraint, which in this

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:25.656 A:middle
case is not necessary and

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:26.916 A:middle
generally fixed width

00:14:26.916 --> 00:14:29.936 A:middle
constraints on text controls are

00:14:29.936 --> 00:14:31.636 A:middle
a bad idea for localization.

00:14:32.566 --> 00:14:34.846 A:middle
So if I get rid of it you'll see

00:14:34.846 --> 00:14:36.466 A:middle
that my pseudo language looks

00:14:36.466 --> 00:14:38.966 A:middle
exactly as expected and now I

00:14:39.636 --> 00:14:41.296 A:middle
know that I'm not going to be

00:14:41.296 --> 00:14:42.000 A:middle
clipping anything.

00:14:43.236 --> 00:14:45.556 A:middle
So these interface builder

00:14:45.556 --> 00:14:47.186 A:middle
previews are even more helpful

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:48.406 A:middle
if you have more of your UI

00:14:48.406 --> 00:14:49.756 A:middle
defined in your storyboard.

00:14:50.466 --> 00:14:52.436 A:middle
In my case, a lot of my UI is

00:14:52.436 --> 00:14:53.616 A:middle
loaded in my table view

00:14:53.616 --> 00:14:54.166 A:middle
controller.

00:14:54.776 --> 00:14:56.466 A:middle
So I also want to show how I can

00:14:56.466 --> 00:14:58.286 A:middle
use pseudo languages at runtime

00:14:58.286 --> 00:14:58.906 A:middle
to test that.

00:15:00.716 --> 00:15:02.526 A:middle
So if I select -- if I click on

00:15:02.526 --> 00:15:04.466 A:middle
my scheme and select "edit

00:15:04.466 --> 00:15:06.466 A:middle
scheme" -- and make sure you

00:15:06.466 --> 00:15:07.516 A:middle
have "run" selected in the

00:15:07.516 --> 00:15:09.856 A:middle
sidebar -- under "application

00:15:09.856 --> 00:15:10.946 A:middle
language" you get a list of

00:15:10.946 --> 00:15:12.206 A:middle
languages you can choose from,

00:15:12.776 --> 00:15:14.126 A:middle
but over at the bottom you have

00:15:14.126 --> 00:15:15.896 A:middle
a list of all the available

00:15:16.016 --> 00:15:17.596 A:middle
pseudo languages you can use as

00:15:17.596 --> 00:15:18.616 A:middle
well -- at runtime.

00:15:19.676 --> 00:15:20.796 A:middle
Another pseudo language we've

00:15:20.796 --> 00:15:22.826 A:middle
added in Xcode 9 is the accented

00:15:22.826 --> 00:15:23.656 A:middle
Latin pseudo language.

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:24.976 A:middle
And if I go ahead and play that

00:15:25.476 --> 00:15:33.726 A:middle
--

00:15:34.226 --> 00:15:36.926 A:middle
My app will launch with accents

00:15:36.926 --> 00:15:38.556 A:middle
above and below each of my

00:15:38.556 --> 00:15:39.646 A:middle
localizable strings.

00:15:40.296 --> 00:15:41.806 A:middle
And what this really helps with

00:15:41.806 --> 00:15:43.446 A:middle
is it gives me a preview of what

00:15:43.446 --> 00:15:44.956 A:middle
my app -- how my app would

00:15:44.956 --> 00:15:46.476 A:middle
handle languages that use a lot

00:15:46.476 --> 00:15:49.286 A:middle
of accents, diacritics, or even

00:15:49.286 --> 00:15:51.096 A:middle
languages where the scripted

00:15:51.096 --> 00:15:52.796 A:middle
self is generally taller than

00:15:52.796 --> 00:15:53.966 A:middle
English -- like Thai for

00:15:53.966 --> 00:15:54.396 A:middle
example.

00:15:55.096 --> 00:15:56.786 A:middle
So I can quickly scan this and

00:15:56.786 --> 00:15:58.286 A:middle
make sure that everything's

00:15:58.326 --> 00:16:00.056 A:middle
fitting vertically and I'm not

00:16:00.056 --> 00:16:02.926 A:middle
seeing any clippings.

00:16:02.966 --> 00:16:05.316 A:middle
And everything looks good here.

00:16:05.386 --> 00:16:08.936 A:middle
And then finally one more pseudo

00:16:09.046 --> 00:16:10.736 A:middle
language I'd like to show you at

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:13.666 A:middle
runtime is the new right to left

00:16:13.666 --> 00:16:14.856 A:middle
pseudo language with right to

00:16:14.856 --> 00:16:15.476 A:middle
left strings.

00:16:16.876 --> 00:16:18.416 A:middle
And this pseudo language is very

00:16:18.416 --> 00:16:19.726 A:middle
helpful in testing whether your

00:16:19.726 --> 00:16:21.866 A:middle
app is ready for right to left

00:16:21.866 --> 00:16:23.616 A:middle
languages like Arabic and Hebrew

00:16:23.956 --> 00:16:25.316 A:middle
where the text itself is written

00:16:25.316 --> 00:16:26.076 A:middle
from right to left.

00:16:26.656 --> 00:16:28.096 A:middle
So as you can see, my UI

00:16:28.096 --> 00:16:29.866 A:middle
controls are already adjusted

00:16:29.866 --> 00:16:32.406 A:middle
and mirrored to look the way

00:16:32.406 --> 00:16:34.366 A:middle
they would look in a right to

00:16:34.366 --> 00:16:35.326 A:middle
left localization.

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:37.606 A:middle
And what we also do is we

00:16:37.606 --> 00:16:39.406 A:middle
display the localizable strings

00:16:39.406 --> 00:16:40.176 A:middle
from right to left.

00:16:40.176 --> 00:16:41.946 A:middle
So the letters themselves have

00:16:41.946 --> 00:16:43.816 A:middle
flipped order and that really

00:16:43.816 --> 00:16:46.466 A:middle
helps give you an idea -- or put

00:16:46.466 --> 00:16:47.836 A:middle
you in the mindset of somebody

00:16:47.836 --> 00:16:49.616 A:middle
who reads their text from right

00:16:49.616 --> 00:16:50.526 A:middle
to left.

00:16:51.056 --> 00:16:52.806 A:middle
So these are some of the pseudo

00:16:52.806 --> 00:16:53.996 A:middle
languages.

00:16:54.516 --> 00:16:55.886 A:middle
I highly encourage you to try

00:16:55.886 --> 00:16:56.336 A:middle
them all.

00:16:56.506 --> 00:16:57.946 A:middle
They're very helpful to test

00:16:57.946 --> 00:16:59.426 A:middle
your app before you even add

00:16:59.426 --> 00:16:59.976 A:middle
localization.

00:17:03.456 --> 00:17:04.446 A:middle
And to summarize the

00:17:04.446 --> 00:17:06.006 A:middle
internationalization process;

00:17:06.866 --> 00:17:08.596 A:middle
first make sure you're using

00:17:08.596 --> 00:17:10.076 A:middle
standard APIs to load

00:17:10.076 --> 00:17:11.916 A:middle
localizable strings as well as

00:17:11.956 --> 00:17:13.726 A:middle
to format your data, like dates

00:17:13.726 --> 00:17:14.186 A:middle
and numbers.

00:17:14.836 --> 00:17:18.436 A:middle
And make sure your app is using

00:17:18.436 --> 00:17:20.106 A:middle
base internationalization to

00:17:20.106 --> 00:17:21.866 A:middle
separate your UI from your

00:17:21.866 --> 00:17:23.126 A:middle
localizable content.

00:17:23.516 --> 00:17:25.136 A:middle
And, of course, use auto layout

00:17:25.136 --> 00:17:26.526 A:middle
in your UI to make sure that the

00:17:26.526 --> 00:17:28.846 A:middle
app itself is flexible and can

00:17:28.876 --> 00:17:31.156 A:middle
adapt to different translations.

00:17:32.496 --> 00:17:34.176 A:middle
And, finally, we showed a lot of

00:17:34.256 --> 00:17:35.706 A:middle
tools that can validate your

00:17:35.706 --> 00:17:38.016 A:middle
internationalization, like the

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:39.656 A:middle
new pseudo languages we've added

00:17:39.656 --> 00:17:41.646 A:middle
and the auto layout warnings

00:17:41.676 --> 00:17:42.816 A:middle
that are coming soon in the

00:17:42.816 --> 00:17:43.536 A:middle
future seat.

00:17:44.556 --> 00:17:46.746 A:middle
So my app is internationalized

00:17:46.746 --> 00:17:48.386 A:middle
now and I'm ready to add my

00:17:48.386 --> 00:17:49.426 A:middle
first localization.

00:17:49.426 --> 00:17:51.286 A:middle
So I'm going to call Sarah back

00:17:51.286 --> 00:17:53.036 A:middle
up on stage to show us how to do

00:17:53.036 --> 00:17:54.366 A:middle
that since she's the expert on

00:17:54.596 --> 00:17:55.506 A:middle
the topic.

00:17:56.516 --> 00:18:01.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:18:02.046 --> 00:18:03.336 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ia.

00:18:03.366 --> 00:18:04.746 A:middle
So now that you're done with the

00:18:04.746 --> 00:18:06.276 A:middle
steps that Ia showed us earlier

00:18:06.276 --> 00:18:07.836 A:middle
in her demo, you are ready to

00:18:07.976 --> 00:18:09.956 A:middle
add new languages to your app.

00:18:09.956 --> 00:18:11.466 A:middle
And you can do that right from

00:18:11.526 --> 00:18:13.506 A:middle
Xcode from your project info and

00:18:13.506 --> 00:18:15.496 A:middle
you have over 100 languages to

00:18:15.496 --> 00:18:16.096 A:middle
choose from.

00:18:17.066 --> 00:18:18.306 A:middle
So now that you've added these

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.616 A:middle
languages that you want to

00:18:19.616 --> 00:18:21.376 A:middle
support in your app, so to

00:18:21.376 --> 00:18:23.196 A:middle
generate the localizable content

00:18:23.246 --> 00:18:25.506 A:middle
for your translators Xcode will

00:18:25.506 --> 00:18:27.196 A:middle
find all the localizable

00:18:27.196 --> 00:18:28.866 A:middle
resources that you have in your

00:18:28.956 --> 00:18:30.926 A:middle
project, then when you export

00:18:30.926 --> 00:18:32.536 A:middle
your projects for localization

00:18:32.866 --> 00:18:34.746 A:middle
Xcode will extract the strings

00:18:34.846 --> 00:18:36.496 A:middle
from this localizable resources

00:18:36.856 --> 00:18:38.986 A:middle
and generate XLIFF files for

00:18:38.986 --> 00:18:40.326 A:middle
every single language that you

00:18:40.326 --> 00:18:40.896 A:middle
have added.

00:18:41.486 --> 00:18:43.176 A:middle
And XLIFF file is simply a

00:18:43.176 --> 00:18:45.546 A:middle
standard XML localization file

00:18:45.546 --> 00:18:47.126 A:middle
format that is standard in the

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:48.366 A:middle
localization industry.

00:18:48.826 --> 00:18:50.616 A:middle
So if you send your XLIFF files

00:18:50.616 --> 00:18:51.916 A:middle
to one of the localizers they

00:18:52.076 --> 00:18:53.516 A:middle
will be already familiar with

00:18:53.516 --> 00:18:54.956 A:middle
the formats and how to work with

00:18:54.956 --> 00:18:55.116 A:middle
it.

00:18:56.276 --> 00:18:57.586 A:middle
So once your XLIFF files are

00:18:57.586 --> 00:18:59.546 A:middle
translated you can import them

00:18:59.546 --> 00:19:02.696 A:middle
back and Xcode will integrate

00:19:02.696 --> 00:19:04.716 A:middle
automatically your localized

00:19:04.716 --> 00:19:06.646 A:middle
text back into your project.

00:19:07.046 --> 00:19:08.436 A:middle
And that's the localization

00:19:08.436 --> 00:19:09.606 A:middle
process in Xcode.

00:19:09.786 --> 00:19:11.016 A:middle
It's very simple and

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:11.736 A:middle
straightforward.

00:19:13.226 --> 00:19:15.266 A:middle
And new in Xcode 9 we are adding

00:19:15.326 --> 00:19:17.496 A:middle
support for exporting and

00:19:17.496 --> 00:19:19.836 A:middle
importing string dics file

00:19:20.006 --> 00:19:20.536 A:middle
formats.

00:19:21.516 --> 00:19:23.116 A:middle
So string dics is the powerful

00:19:23.116 --> 00:19:24.796 A:middle
tool that lets you handle

00:19:24.986 --> 00:19:26.996 A:middle
plurals and adaptive strings in

00:19:26.996 --> 00:19:27.556 A:middle
your app.

00:19:29.116 --> 00:19:31.646 A:middle
In Xcode 9 you can now add and

00:19:31.646 --> 00:19:33.646 A:middle
create string dictionaries right

00:19:33.646 --> 00:19:35.616 A:middle
from the file template list in

00:19:35.616 --> 00:19:37.926 A:middle
Xcode and that will generate an

00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:39.926 A:middle
editor for you where you can add

00:19:40.036 --> 00:19:41.966 A:middle
and edit your keys and values.

00:19:42.596 --> 00:19:45.446 A:middle
So now let's talk more in detail

00:19:45.446 --> 00:19:46.796 A:middle
about what can you do with

00:19:46.796 --> 00:19:48.246 A:middle
strings dictionaries and why

00:19:48.246 --> 00:19:48.986 A:middle
they are helpful.

00:19:49.936 --> 00:19:51.506 A:middle
So first strings dictionaries

00:19:51.506 --> 00:19:53.366 A:middle
can help you handle the

00:19:53.366 --> 00:19:54.966 A:middle
complexity of plural forms

00:19:54.966 --> 00:19:56.936 A:middle
without writing any code in your

00:19:57.556 --> 00:19:57.626 A:middle
app.

00:19:58.196 --> 00:20:00.236 A:middle
So let's assume I have this

00:20:00.236 --> 00:20:02.166 A:middle
logic in my code to handle

00:20:02.226 --> 00:20:03.106 A:middle
plural variants.

00:20:03.556 --> 00:20:05.066 A:middle
So here I have an array.

00:20:05.556 --> 00:20:07.206 A:middle
If the count of my array is one

00:20:07.596 --> 00:20:09.896 A:middle
I set my string to one popular

00:20:09.896 --> 00:20:10.486 A:middle
language.

00:20:10.846 --> 00:20:13.426 A:middle
Else if the count of my array is

00:20:13.426 --> 00:20:15.416 A:middle
more than one I set my string

00:20:15.416 --> 00:20:17.006 A:middle
here to something like person d

00:20:17.006 --> 00:20:19.276 A:middle
popular languages where person d

00:20:19.276 --> 00:20:20.576 A:middle
is a format string that will

00:20:20.576 --> 00:20:22.136 A:middle
replace the runtime with the

00:20:22.176 --> 00:20:23.116 A:middle
count of my array.

00:20:23.906 --> 00:20:26.166 A:middle
So this logic might work -- well

00:20:26.166 --> 00:20:27.916 A:middle
it would work for a language

00:20:27.916 --> 00:20:29.256 A:middle
like English where there are

00:20:29.386 --> 00:20:31.096 A:middle
only two plural forms; one

00:20:31.096 --> 00:20:32.296 A:middle
singular and one plural.

00:20:33.386 --> 00:20:34.626 A:middle
But this would be a complete

00:20:34.626 --> 00:20:36.436 A:middle
disaster for a language like

00:20:36.626 --> 00:20:38.046 A:middle
Russian where there are more

00:20:38.046 --> 00:20:39.126 A:middle
plural variants.

00:20:39.546 --> 00:20:41.056 A:middle
So Russian has four different

00:20:41.056 --> 00:20:42.616 A:middle
plural variants and your

00:20:42.756 --> 00:20:44.216 A:middle
translators need to think about

00:20:44.456 --> 00:20:46.166 A:middle
work arounds and ways on how to

00:20:46.166 --> 00:20:47.536 A:middle
translate all these variants

00:20:47.536 --> 00:20:49.506 A:middle
with the one generic plural that

00:20:49.746 --> 00:20:50.886 A:middle
you provided -- the one you are

00:20:50.886 --> 00:20:52.746 A:middle
using for English, which will

00:20:52.806 --> 00:20:56.256 A:middle
make basically your translations

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:57.626 A:middle
sound robotic and not very

00:20:57.626 --> 00:20:59.256 A:middle
natural for a native speaker.

00:20:59.516 --> 00:21:03.006 A:middle
So this example here sounds like

00:21:03.006 --> 00:21:04.636 A:middle
something; "popular languages

00:21:04.636 --> 00:21:06.096 A:middle
column one, popular languages

00:21:06.166 --> 00:21:07.506 A:middle
column two," and you don't want

00:21:07.586 --> 00:21:09.156 A:middle
that in your app.

00:21:09.306 --> 00:21:10.416 A:middle
So to solve this kind of

00:21:10.516 --> 00:21:13.436 A:middle
problem, when we're done writing

00:21:13.436 --> 00:21:15.126 A:middle
any code you can just use

00:21:15.386 --> 00:21:16.306 A:middle
strings dictionaries.

00:21:17.246 --> 00:21:18.786 A:middle
So all you need to do in your

00:21:18.786 --> 00:21:20.816 A:middle
strings dics file -- so you need

00:21:20.816 --> 00:21:23.186 A:middle
to add your localized format

00:21:23.186 --> 00:21:23.456 A:middle
key.

00:21:24.296 --> 00:21:25.876 A:middle
In this example my localized

00:21:25.876 --> 00:21:27.446 A:middle
format key is "languages."

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:30.566 A:middle
Then you need to add the plural

00:21:30.566 --> 00:21:32.256 A:middle
variants that are relevant for

00:21:32.256 --> 00:21:34.596 A:middle
your development language.

00:21:34.756 --> 00:21:36.176 A:middle
So since here my development

00:21:36.176 --> 00:21:37.936 A:middle
language is English, I only care

00:21:37.936 --> 00:21:39.726 A:middle
about two plural variants, one

00:21:39.726 --> 00:21:40.246 A:middle
and other.

00:21:40.246 --> 00:21:41.896 A:middle
So one is for the singular case

00:21:42.186 --> 00:21:43.736 A:middle
and other is for the plural

00:21:43.736 --> 00:21:44.046 A:middle
case.

00:21:45.526 --> 00:21:47.596 A:middle
Then by wrapping your plural

00:21:47.706 --> 00:21:49.436 A:middle
string with NS Localized String,

00:21:49.826 --> 00:21:51.876 A:middle
as you will do with any other

00:21:52.416 --> 00:21:53.386 A:middle
string that you have in your

00:21:53.446 --> 00:21:55.246 A:middle
code, when you export your

00:21:55.286 --> 00:21:57.046 A:middle
projects for localization, Xcode

00:21:57.046 --> 00:21:59.126 A:middle
will generate automatically for

00:21:59.126 --> 00:22:01.046 A:middle
you the plural keys for other

00:22:01.046 --> 00:22:02.306 A:middle
languages that you support.

00:22:02.816 --> 00:22:05.576 A:middle
So the variance for other

00:22:05.576 --> 00:22:07.126 A:middle
languages will be included in

00:22:07.126 --> 00:22:08.826 A:middle
your XK files and your

00:22:08.926 --> 00:22:09.866 A:middle
translators when they are

00:22:10.016 --> 00:22:11.496 A:middle
translating the strings they

00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:13.256 A:middle
will find the plural variants

00:22:13.256 --> 00:22:14.536 A:middle
that are relevant for the

00:22:14.536 --> 00:22:15.086 A:middle
language.

00:22:15.596 --> 00:22:17.166 A:middle
And now our translation will be

00:22:17.166 --> 00:22:18.736 A:middle
correct and your users will have

00:22:18.736 --> 00:22:20.296 A:middle
more grammatically correct

00:22:20.296 --> 00:22:21.016 A:middle
translations.

00:22:21.756 --> 00:22:23.436 A:middle
So this is Strings Dics support

00:22:23.436 --> 00:22:26.426 A:middle
for Plural Variants in Xcode 9.

00:22:27.106 --> 00:22:28.776 A:middle
Another thing you can do with

00:22:28.776 --> 00:22:30.666 A:middle
strings dictionaries in Xcode 9

00:22:30.666 --> 00:22:32.536 A:middle
is support for adaptive strings.

00:22:33.456 --> 00:22:36.256 A:middle
So if we take this example from

00:22:36.576 --> 00:22:39.316 A:middle
Ia's app earlier, she had a

00:22:39.316 --> 00:22:41.166 A:middle
string here called "Gross

00:22:41.236 --> 00:22:42.696 A:middle
Domestic Products in Billions,"

00:22:42.696 --> 00:22:44.066 A:middle
which is kind of long, but it

00:22:44.066 --> 00:22:45.406 A:middle
fits fine on an iPad because

00:22:45.406 --> 00:22:46.816 A:middle
there is enough space for it.

00:22:47.636 --> 00:22:49.366 A:middle
If we run the app again in a

00:22:49.366 --> 00:22:51.546 A:middle
smaller device like an iPhone 7

00:22:52.436 --> 00:22:53.716 A:middle
-- so this string does not fit

00:22:53.716 --> 00:22:54.206 A:middle
anymore.

00:22:54.306 --> 00:22:55.616 A:middle
As you can see on the screen,

00:22:55.616 --> 00:22:56.936 A:middle
the number on the right side now

00:22:56.986 --> 00:22:58.566 A:middle
shrinks and you can only read

00:22:58.566 --> 00:22:59.606 A:middle
the three first characters,

00:22:59.606 --> 00:23:00.766 A:middle
which is kind of wrong because

00:23:00.766 --> 00:23:01.486 A:middle
we are given the wrong

00:23:01.486 --> 00:23:02.626 A:middle
information to the user.

00:23:03.706 --> 00:23:05.736 A:middle
So you can take advantage of

00:23:06.186 --> 00:23:07.866 A:middle
strings dictionaries again to

00:23:07.866 --> 00:23:09.216 A:middle
solve these kinds of problems

00:23:09.476 --> 00:23:10.996 A:middle
and provide different string

00:23:10.996 --> 00:23:12.486 A:middle
variants for your app.

00:23:13.166 --> 00:23:14.506 A:middle
So here I have three different

00:23:14.506 --> 00:23:17.086 A:middle
keys; 20, 25, and 50.

00:23:17.366 --> 00:23:18.556 A:middle
They correspond to different

00:23:18.556 --> 00:23:19.336 A:middle
screen sizes.

00:23:19.336 --> 00:23:21.586 A:middle
And then I have the strings that

00:23:21.586 --> 00:23:23.246 A:middle
I want to show for every screen

00:23:23.246 --> 00:23:23.606 A:middle
size.

00:23:24.346 --> 00:23:26.586 A:middle
So if you call NS Localized

00:23:26.676 --> 00:23:28.796 A:middle
Strings on the key within your

00:23:28.796 --> 00:23:29.736 A:middle
strings dics file.

00:23:30.386 --> 00:23:31.706 A:middle
So you enable -- we pick the

00:23:31.706 --> 00:23:34.096 A:middle
right value for you at runtime

00:23:34.196 --> 00:23:36.266 A:middle
based on the space available on

00:23:36.266 --> 00:23:36.826 A:middle
the screen.

00:23:37.856 --> 00:23:39.596 A:middle
So if you are not using UI label

00:23:39.596 --> 00:23:40.606 A:middle
and you are using a custom

00:23:40.606 --> 00:23:42.626 A:middle
control of your own, you can

00:23:42.626 --> 00:23:44.196 A:middle
still take advantage of the

00:23:44.196 --> 00:23:46.096 A:middle
functionality by calling

00:23:46.236 --> 00:23:47.926 A:middle
variance fit in presentation

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:50.476 A:middle
with API, where you pass in one

00:23:50.476 --> 00:23:51.496 A:middle
of the keys that you have

00:23:51.496 --> 00:23:53.146 A:middle
defined in your strings dics

00:23:53.146 --> 00:23:54.956 A:middle
file and then at runtime this

00:23:54.956 --> 00:23:56.446 A:middle
will choose the right value for

00:23:56.446 --> 00:23:57.746 A:middle
you that corresponds to that

00:23:57.746 --> 00:23:57.876 A:middle
key.

00:23:58.646 --> 00:24:00.696 A:middle
And we will be providing the

00:24:00.696 --> 00:24:02.186 A:middle
keys and the corresponding

00:24:02.186 --> 00:24:03.266 A:middle
screen sizes in the

00:24:03.266 --> 00:24:04.756 A:middle
documentation if you would like

00:24:04.756 --> 00:24:05.746 A:middle
to check out that later.

00:24:07.046 --> 00:24:09.156 A:middle
So now if we run again the app

00:24:09.346 --> 00:24:11.036 A:middle
on the iPad, still using the

00:24:11.036 --> 00:24:13.556 A:middle
full string, and if we run it

00:24:13.556 --> 00:24:15.196 A:middle
again in a smaller device like

00:24:15.196 --> 00:24:17.226 A:middle
an iPhone 7 now we pick the

00:24:17.226 --> 00:24:18.546 A:middle
right variant that will fit

00:24:18.716 --> 00:24:20.486 A:middle
nicely on the screen size.

00:24:21.286 --> 00:24:22.316 A:middle
And thus without erasing a

00:24:22.396 --> 00:24:23.946 A:middle
single line of code your app

00:24:23.946 --> 00:24:26.066 A:middle
looks nice and beautiful in all

00:24:26.196 --> 00:24:27.526 A:middle
different screen sizes and

00:24:27.526 --> 00:24:29.316 A:middle
configurations of your app.

00:24:29.316 --> 00:24:30.776 A:middle
And adaptive strings are really

00:24:30.776 --> 00:24:32.496 A:middle
helpful if you are supporting

00:24:32.496 --> 00:24:33.726 A:middle
localizations in your app

00:24:33.856 --> 00:24:34.896 A:middle
because you might have some

00:24:34.896 --> 00:24:36.466 A:middle
languages that are longer or

00:24:36.466 --> 00:24:38.056 A:middle
shorter than others and you want

00:24:38.056 --> 00:24:39.426 A:middle
to give this flexibility to your

00:24:39.426 --> 00:24:41.496 A:middle
translators to provide like

00:24:41.496 --> 00:24:42.686 A:middle
adaptive strings for the

00:24:42.686 --> 00:24:43.216 A:middle
language.

00:24:44.936 --> 00:24:46.266 A:middle
So now that you're done with

00:24:46.266 --> 00:24:48.316 A:middle
supporting plural support as

00:24:48.316 --> 00:24:50.286 A:middle
well as adaptive strings you are

00:24:50.286 --> 00:24:52.556 A:middle
ready to localize your app.

00:24:52.556 --> 00:24:53.516 A:middle
And the first step in

00:24:53.516 --> 00:24:55.926 A:middle
localization is exporting your

00:24:55.926 --> 00:24:56.596 A:middle
project.

00:24:57.006 --> 00:24:58.326 A:middle
So when you export your projects

00:24:58.326 --> 00:25:00.126 A:middle
for localization -- so Xcode

00:25:00.126 --> 00:25:01.436 A:middle
will ask you which languages you

00:25:01.436 --> 00:25:02.966 A:middle
want to localize first.

00:25:03.006 --> 00:25:04.506 A:middle
So once you pick the language

00:25:04.506 --> 00:25:06.386 A:middle
you want Xcode will generate

00:25:06.526 --> 00:25:09.076 A:middle
XLIFF files for you to send to

00:25:09.186 --> 00:25:09.806 A:middle
your translators.

00:25:10.236 --> 00:25:11.516 A:middle
So once your XLIFF files are

00:25:11.636 --> 00:25:14.026 A:middle
translated you can import them

00:25:14.026 --> 00:25:16.196 A:middle
back in your project and Xcode

00:25:16.196 --> 00:25:17.646 A:middle
will show you this nice diff

00:25:17.926 --> 00:25:19.796 A:middle
with what was changed by your

00:25:19.926 --> 00:25:20.616 A:middle
translators.

00:25:22.176 --> 00:25:24.046 A:middle
And after that Xcode will just

00:25:24.046 --> 00:25:25.416 A:middle
integrate your localized text

00:25:25.576 --> 00:25:27.136 A:middle
back into your project and your

00:25:27.136 --> 00:25:28.886 A:middle
strings will be localized.

00:25:29.436 --> 00:25:31.616 A:middle
So now that your strings are

00:25:31.616 --> 00:25:33.126 A:middle
localized, what about other

00:25:33.126 --> 00:25:34.636 A:middle
resources that are not string

00:25:34.636 --> 00:25:36.986 A:middle
based that you want -- probably

00:25:36.986 --> 00:25:38.136 A:middle
you want to localize, like

00:25:38.136 --> 00:25:39.566 A:middle
images or audio files?

00:25:39.656 --> 00:25:42.036 A:middle
So you might have something like

00:25:42.036 --> 00:25:44.336 A:middle
this, an image that has text on

00:25:44.366 --> 00:25:46.136 A:middle
it, and you want to provide an

00:25:46.136 --> 00:25:47.566 A:middle
alternative image for other

00:25:47.566 --> 00:25:48.186 A:middle
languages.

00:25:48.616 --> 00:25:50.256 A:middle
So you can localize other

00:25:50.536 --> 00:25:52.866 A:middle
resources in Xcode easily by

00:25:52.866 --> 00:25:54.346 A:middle
clicking the "localize" button

00:25:54.346 --> 00:25:55.786 A:middle
in the "file inspector."

00:25:56.336 --> 00:25:58.356 A:middle
Again Xcode will ask you which

00:25:58.356 --> 00:25:59.576 A:middle
language you want to localize

00:25:59.576 --> 00:26:00.426 A:middle
this asset for.

00:26:00.426 --> 00:26:02.066 A:middle
You can pick from the list of

00:26:02.146 --> 00:26:04.426 A:middle
your languages and Xcode will

00:26:04.426 --> 00:26:06.436 A:middle
move this asset to the specific

00:26:06.436 --> 00:26:08.326 A:middle
language folder where you can

00:26:08.326 --> 00:26:09.916 A:middle
replace it with the image or the

00:26:09.996 --> 00:26:11.546 A:middle
asset that you want to show for

00:26:11.546 --> 00:26:12.346 A:middle
that language.

00:26:13.166 --> 00:26:14.756 A:middle
So this is the localization

00:26:14.756 --> 00:26:16.196 A:middle
workflow in Xcode 9.

00:26:16.646 --> 00:26:19.186 A:middle
So we saw how to support plurals

00:26:19.276 --> 00:26:21.056 A:middle
as well as adaptive strings and

00:26:21.056 --> 00:26:22.586 A:middle
how to localize other resources.

00:26:23.006 --> 00:26:24.286 A:middle
And with that I would like to

00:26:24.326 --> 00:26:26.256 A:middle
call Chris on stage to give you

00:26:26.256 --> 00:26:26.586 A:middle
a demo.

00:26:26.586 --> 00:26:26.916 A:middle
Thank you.

00:26:27.016 --> 00:26:29.000 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:29.246 --> 00:26:29.786 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Sarah.

00:26:29.916 --> 00:26:29.983 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:26:30.016 --> 00:26:32.000 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:26:41.236 --> 00:26:44.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So earlier we saw Ia validate

00:26:44.556 --> 00:26:45.136 A:middle
that her app as

00:26:45.136 --> 00:26:47.206 A:middle
internationalized using both our

00:26:47.206 --> 00:26:49.066 A:middle
framework and tools features.

00:26:49.276 --> 00:26:51.456 A:middle
So let's get started on actually

00:26:51.456 --> 00:26:52.856 A:middle
localizing it.

00:26:52.966 --> 00:26:54.036 A:middle
First though, I really

00:26:54.036 --> 00:26:55.526 A:middle
appreciated Sarah's discussion

00:26:55.526 --> 00:26:56.956 A:middle
of plurals and adaptive width

00:26:56.956 --> 00:26:57.476 A:middle
strings.

00:26:58.206 --> 00:26:59.866 A:middle
So I've added a strings dict

00:26:59.866 --> 00:27:01.166 A:middle
file to our project here.

00:27:03.686 --> 00:27:04.286 A:middle
Oops. [laughs]

00:27:13.136 --> 00:27:15.996 A:middle
And I've added that GDP adaptive

00:27:16.036 --> 00:27:19.116 A:middle
width string with all of the

00:27:19.116 --> 00:27:20.656 A:middle
different variants for our

00:27:20.656 --> 00:27:23.246 A:middle
different device widths; 20, 25,

00:27:23.506 --> 00:27:24.126 A:middle
and 50.

00:27:25.196 --> 00:27:26.996 A:middle
And I've also created a plural

00:27:26.996 --> 00:27:28.636 A:middle
variant, just like Sarah showed,

00:27:29.886 --> 00:27:31.296 A:middle
for the number of popular

00:27:31.296 --> 00:27:32.066 A:middle
languages.

00:27:32.646 --> 00:27:35.836 A:middle
Now though, I'm ready to

00:27:35.836 --> 00:27:37.786 A:middle
localize my application into

00:27:37.786 --> 00:27:38.196 A:middle
Russian.

00:27:39.156 --> 00:27:40.586 A:middle
So what I'm going to do is go to

00:27:40.586 --> 00:27:42.996 A:middle
the project editor and right

00:27:42.996 --> 00:27:44.856 A:middle
under my localizations, where it

00:27:44.856 --> 00:27:46.016 A:middle
tells me that English is my

00:27:46.016 --> 00:27:47.546 A:middle
development language, I have

00:27:47.546 --> 00:27:48.346 A:middle
this plus button.

00:27:48.746 --> 00:27:50.346 A:middle
I can choose that and just go

00:27:50.346 --> 00:27:51.996 A:middle
about halfway down and choose

00:27:52.036 --> 00:27:52.436 A:middle
Russian.

00:27:53.126 --> 00:27:54.986 A:middle
And Xcode will ask me which of

00:27:54.986 --> 00:27:57.116 A:middle
my resources I want to take and

00:27:57.116 --> 00:27:58.916 A:middle
make Russian placeholders for.

00:28:00.366 --> 00:28:01.536 A:middle
Since I want to localize

00:28:01.536 --> 00:28:03.066 A:middle
everything I'm just going to

00:28:03.066 --> 00:28:04.076 A:middle
tell Xcode to finish.

00:28:04.586 --> 00:28:08.546 A:middle
And you can see that in addition

00:28:08.546 --> 00:28:10.896 A:middle
to my main storyboard file I now

00:28:10.896 --> 00:28:12.746 A:middle
have a placeholder for my

00:28:12.746 --> 00:28:13.786 A:middle
Russian strings.

00:28:15.046 --> 00:28:17.796 A:middle
Still in the project editor, I'm

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:19.026 A:middle
going to go to the "editor" menu

00:28:19.026 --> 00:28:20.676 A:middle
now and I'm going to export my

00:28:20.676 --> 00:28:22.086 A:middle
project for localization.

00:28:22.626 --> 00:28:26.856 A:middle
And I'm just going to save this

00:28:26.856 --> 00:28:28.826 A:middle
file -- actually this folder --

00:28:29.196 --> 00:28:32.276 A:middle
on the desktop and Xcode is

00:28:32.276 --> 00:28:33.516 A:middle
going to read through all of my

00:28:33.516 --> 00:28:34.606 A:middle
source code, all of my

00:28:34.606 --> 00:28:36.226 A:middle
resources, and it's going to

00:28:36.226 --> 00:28:38.266 A:middle
generate that XLIFF file.

00:28:38.266 --> 00:28:39.626 A:middle
So let's take a look at what it

00:28:39.626 --> 00:28:39.976 A:middle
looks like.

00:28:45.066 --> 00:28:45.906 A:middle
Here you can see that the file

00:28:45.906 --> 00:28:49.386 A:middle
is named "ru.xliff" where ru is

00:28:49.386 --> 00:28:51.026 A:middle
the ISO language code for the

00:28:51.026 --> 00:28:51.846 A:middle
Russian language.

00:28:52.256 --> 00:28:54.296 A:middle
And if I double click this we

00:28:54.296 --> 00:28:55.286 A:middle
have a little tool that we've

00:28:55.286 --> 00:28:57.446 A:middle
written so that we can see all

00:28:57.446 --> 00:28:59.076 A:middle
of this localization data in

00:28:59.076 --> 00:29:00.396 A:middle
sort of a tabular form so that

00:29:00.396 --> 00:29:01.456 A:middle
we don't have to wade through a

00:29:01.456 --> 00:29:02.626 A:middle
whole bunch of XML angle

00:29:02.626 --> 00:29:04.376 A:middle
brackets just to show you.

00:29:04.896 --> 00:29:09.696 A:middle
And up at the top here you can

00:29:09.696 --> 00:29:11.446 A:middle
see a bunch of strings that came

00:29:11.446 --> 00:29:12.786 A:middle
directly from our storyboard

00:29:12.786 --> 00:29:13.156 A:middle
file.

00:29:14.606 --> 00:29:15.886 A:middle
And you can see in our

00:29:15.886 --> 00:29:17.296 A:middle
translation column everything is

00:29:17.296 --> 00:29:18.326 A:middle
in red because we haven't

00:29:18.326 --> 00:29:20.396 A:middle
actually put any translations in

00:29:20.396 --> 00:29:22.656 A:middle
this XLIFF file yet.

00:29:23.906 --> 00:29:25.716 A:middle
Here in the next section we have

00:29:26.176 --> 00:29:28.066 A:middle
file -- we have elements that

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:29.716 A:middle
will go into our localized

00:29:29.966 --> 00:29:30.886 A:middle
strings -- our

00:29:30.886 --> 00:29:33.236 A:middle
localizable.stringsdict file.

00:29:34.166 --> 00:29:35.626 A:middle
And you can see that there are

00:29:35.626 --> 00:29:38.526 A:middle
more variants of the percent d

00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:41.776 A:middle
popular languages string than we

00:29:41.776 --> 00:29:43.056 A:middle
had in our original

00:29:43.136 --> 00:29:44.576 A:middle
localizable.stringsdict.

00:29:44.576 --> 00:29:46.356 A:middle
And this is because Xcode knows

00:29:46.356 --> 00:29:47.766 A:middle
that we're exporting to Russian

00:29:48.096 --> 00:29:49.716 A:middle
and creates placeholders for all

00:29:49.716 --> 00:29:51.266 A:middle
of the Russian variants for you

00:29:51.266 --> 00:29:51.996 A:middle
automatically.

00:29:53.556 --> 00:29:55.426 A:middle
We also have our adaptive width

00:29:55.426 --> 00:29:57.756 A:middle
string variants for the gross

00:29:57.756 --> 00:30:00.166 A:middle
domestic product and we have a

00:30:00.166 --> 00:30:02.536 A:middle
couple other things like our

00:30:02.676 --> 00:30:03.636 A:middle
application name and our

00:30:03.636 --> 00:30:06.726 A:middle
info.plist and the strings from

00:30:06.726 --> 00:30:08.806 A:middle
our source code that will then

00:30:08.806 --> 00:30:09.886 A:middle
show up in a Russian

00:30:09.886 --> 00:30:12.316 A:middle
localizable.strings file upon

00:30:12.316 --> 00:30:12.736 A:middle
import.

00:30:13.636 --> 00:30:14.586 A:middle
Now let's say I have a

00:30:14.586 --> 00:30:16.056 A:middle
translator who worked really

00:30:16.056 --> 00:30:19.936 A:middle
fast and I have a translated

00:30:19.936 --> 00:30:22.676 A:middle
version of this XLIFF ready to

00:30:22.676 --> 00:30:23.006 A:middle
go.

00:30:23.916 --> 00:30:25.176 A:middle
I could just go to the project

00:30:25.176 --> 00:30:27.656 A:middle
editor in Xcode and choose

00:30:27.876 --> 00:30:31.496 A:middle
"import localizations" and just

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:35.216 A:middle
choose that file and export --

00:30:35.216 --> 00:30:36.556 A:middle
Xcode will read your project,

00:30:36.796 --> 00:30:39.026 A:middle
read the file, and then show you

00:30:39.206 --> 00:30:41.096 A:middle
how what that file is importing

00:30:41.246 --> 00:30:42.366 A:middle
differs from your project.

00:30:42.696 --> 00:30:43.826 A:middle
Here I'm just getting a warning

00:30:43.826 --> 00:30:45.836 A:middle
that I didn't actually localize

00:30:46.586 --> 00:30:48.636 A:middle
the name of my app in English

00:30:48.636 --> 00:30:50.076 A:middle
yet, but I do have a

00:30:50.076 --> 00:30:51.576 A:middle
localization now in Russian.

00:30:52.706 --> 00:30:55.026 A:middle
And I can also see in the files

00:30:55.026 --> 00:30:57.526 A:middle
view here exactly what files

00:30:57.526 --> 00:30:59.396 A:middle
will be affected by this import.

00:30:59.726 --> 00:31:03.036 A:middle
And this is all what I expect.

00:31:03.436 --> 00:31:04.966 A:middle
Now I tell Xcode to import it

00:31:04.966 --> 00:31:07.076 A:middle
and it'll write out these new

00:31:07.076 --> 00:31:08.336 A:middle
resource files for me.

00:31:08.336 --> 00:31:09.626 A:middle
And you can see that where we

00:31:09.626 --> 00:31:10.396 A:middle
didn't have a

00:31:10.396 --> 00:31:12.616 A:middle
localizable.strings file before,

00:31:12.896 --> 00:31:13.866 A:middle
now we have one.

00:31:14.286 --> 00:31:16.256 A:middle
And if I choose it we have a

00:31:16.256 --> 00:31:18.346 A:middle
localizable.strings file with a

00:31:18.346 --> 00:31:21.336 A:middle
whole bunch of Russian text.

00:31:22.706 --> 00:31:24.506 A:middle
Now if I run our application --

00:31:25.446 --> 00:31:26.746 A:middle
it looks like I've hit a little

00:31:26.746 --> 00:31:28.186 A:middle
bug here, that's okay.

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:30.936 A:middle
Oops. I'll just quit and

00:31:32.176 --> 00:31:32.976 A:middle
relaunch Xcode.

00:31:44.306 --> 00:31:45.506 A:middle
Now if I run our application

00:31:45.806 --> 00:31:47.346 A:middle
we're building and Xcode is

00:31:47.396 --> 00:31:49.176 A:middle
integrating all of our

00:31:49.226 --> 00:31:50.736 A:middle
localizable strings that we just

00:31:50.736 --> 00:31:50.976 A:middle
imported.

00:31:55.206 --> 00:31:56.746 A:middle
There is one step that I missed

00:31:56.746 --> 00:31:57.886 A:middle
though, sorry about that.

00:31:58.546 --> 00:32:01.256 A:middle
I want to run my application in

00:32:01.256 --> 00:32:02.576 A:middle
Russian so I can see those

00:32:02.576 --> 00:32:03.346 A:middle
translations.

00:32:03.346 --> 00:32:05.106 A:middle
So I'm just going to open the

00:32:05.106 --> 00:32:06.726 A:middle
scheme editor and I'm going to

00:32:06.726 --> 00:32:07.886 A:middle
switch from that right to left

00:32:07.886 --> 00:32:09.396 A:middle
pseudo language that I was using

00:32:11.076 --> 00:32:12.216 A:middle
to the Russian language.

00:32:12.876 --> 00:32:14.826 A:middle
And now if I run our application

00:32:15.766 --> 00:32:17.486 A:middle
it'll build the storyboard, copy

00:32:17.486 --> 00:32:18.836 A:middle
in the swift standard libraries,

00:32:19.506 --> 00:32:20.226 A:middle
and launch.

00:32:21.956 --> 00:32:23.246 A:middle
And we can see our application

00:32:23.246 --> 00:32:24.286 A:middle
is running in Russian.

00:32:24.666 --> 00:32:26.076 A:middle
And not only are all the

00:32:26.076 --> 00:32:27.376 A:middle
formatters and everything

00:32:27.376 --> 00:32:29.496 A:middle
correct for all of our dates and

00:32:29.496 --> 00:32:32.926 A:middle
our numbers, but we also have

00:32:32.926 --> 00:32:35.226 A:middle
all of that Russian text that we

00:32:35.226 --> 00:32:35.976 A:middle
just imported.

00:32:49.236 --> 00:32:51.466 A:middle
So, to summarize, strings dicts

00:32:51.466 --> 00:32:53.176 A:middle
are really powerful and you can

00:32:53.176 --> 00:32:55.366 A:middle
use them for pluralization and

00:32:55.426 --> 00:32:57.276 A:middle
for adaptive width strings in

00:32:57.276 --> 00:32:59.016 A:middle
your applications to ensure that

00:32:59.016 --> 00:33:01.326 A:middle
they look right not only based

00:33:01.326 --> 00:33:03.036 A:middle
on the user's language, but also

00:33:03.036 --> 00:33:04.196 A:middle
based on their device width.

00:33:06.166 --> 00:33:08.216 A:middle
It's easy to export an XLIFF

00:33:08.316 --> 00:33:10.456 A:middle
from your Xcode application for

00:33:10.456 --> 00:33:13.516 A:middle
your localization process and to

00:33:13.576 --> 00:33:15.356 A:middle
import your translated strings

00:33:15.356 --> 00:33:17.396 A:middle
via XLIFF back into your

00:33:17.396 --> 00:33:19.216 A:middle
application's Xcode project.

00:33:20.876 --> 00:33:22.586 A:middle
And Sarah showed us how you can

00:33:22.586 --> 00:33:24.746 A:middle
also localize non-string

00:33:24.746 --> 00:33:26.486 A:middle
resources in Xcode.

00:33:27.886 --> 00:33:30.716 A:middle
And now Ia is going to show us

00:33:31.026 --> 00:33:32.446 A:middle
how you can test your

00:33:32.446 --> 00:33:33.866 A:middle
localization.

00:33:34.516 --> 00:33:41.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:33:42.046 --> 00:33:42.576 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Chris.

00:33:42.576 --> 00:33:44.406 A:middle
I can't believe that my app is

00:33:44.406 --> 00:33:45.966 A:middle
already localized into its first

00:33:45.966 --> 00:33:47.456 A:middle
language and the steps were

00:33:47.456 --> 00:33:48.516 A:middle
really simple and easy to

00:33:48.516 --> 00:33:48.826 A:middle
follow.

00:33:50.066 --> 00:33:51.556 A:middle
So now that I do have my

00:33:51.556 --> 00:33:53.286 A:middle
localization, let's talk about

00:33:53.286 --> 00:33:54.516 A:middle
some things that we could do to

00:33:54.516 --> 00:33:54.976 A:middle
test it.

00:33:56.436 --> 00:33:58.586 A:middle
New in Xcode 9 we've introduced

00:33:58.586 --> 00:34:00.356 A:middle
the ability to specify the

00:34:00.356 --> 00:34:02.376 A:middle
application language and region

00:34:02.526 --> 00:34:03.556 A:middle
that you would like to run your

00:34:03.556 --> 00:34:04.156 A:middle
tests in.

00:34:04.706 --> 00:34:06.096 A:middle
And you can do this in the test

00:34:06.166 --> 00:34:07.896 A:middle
scheme editor right in Xcode.

00:34:08.356 --> 00:34:11.496 A:middle
And today I want to talk about

00:34:11.496 --> 00:34:13.146 A:middle
UI testing with XC test.

00:34:14.086 --> 00:34:16.226 A:middle
So UI testing is a great way for

00:34:16.226 --> 00:34:17.496 A:middle
you to validate both your

00:34:17.496 --> 00:34:19.446 A:middle
application's UI as well as its

00:34:19.446 --> 00:34:20.166 A:middle
functionality.

00:34:21.336 --> 00:34:23.326 A:middle
Let's take this line of code on

00:34:23.326 --> 00:34:24.316 A:middle
the screen for example.

00:34:25.466 --> 00:34:26.666 A:middle
This is what you would write to

00:34:26.666 --> 00:34:28.886 A:middle
simulate tapping on a table cell

00:34:28.886 --> 00:34:30.496 A:middle
that has the text territory in

00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:31.306 A:middle
it.

00:34:32.166 --> 00:34:33.706 A:middle
Now that's not going to work for

00:34:33.706 --> 00:34:35.866 A:middle
localization because that text

00:34:35.866 --> 00:34:37.526 A:middle
is going to be translated into

00:34:37.526 --> 00:34:38.856 A:middle
each language that you run your

00:34:38.856 --> 00:34:39.386 A:middle
test in.

00:34:40.036 --> 00:34:41.476 A:middle
And additionally, if you decide

00:34:41.476 --> 00:34:42.726 A:middle
to go and change the wording in

00:34:42.726 --> 00:34:43.836 A:middle
your app, even in your

00:34:43.836 --> 00:34:45.296 A:middle
development language -- like

00:34:45.296 --> 00:34:46.286 A:middle
let's say I want to call it

00:34:46.286 --> 00:34:47.356 A:middle
"region" now instead of

00:34:47.356 --> 00:34:49.086 A:middle
"territory," you don't really

00:34:49.086 --> 00:34:50.926 A:middle
want to go back and update every

00:34:50.926 --> 00:34:52.406 A:middle
single test that you've written

00:34:52.526 --> 00:34:53.866 A:middle
just so that it can start

00:34:53.866 --> 00:34:54.566 A:middle
succeeding again.

00:34:55.536 --> 00:34:57.136 A:middle
So instead, what we recommend

00:34:57.136 --> 00:34:58.726 A:middle
you do is use accessibility

00:34:58.726 --> 00:34:59.436 A:middle
identifiers.

00:35:00.766 --> 00:35:02.376 A:middle
These identifiers are unique to

00:35:02.376 --> 00:35:04.456 A:middle
every element on your screen and

00:35:04.456 --> 00:35:06.616 A:middle
you can use them to find these

00:35:06.616 --> 00:35:08.006 A:middle
elements without really knowing

00:35:08.006 --> 00:35:08.886 A:middle
what strings are loaded into

00:35:08.886 --> 00:35:08.976 A:middle
them.

00:35:14.046 --> 00:35:15.526 A:middle
So to set the accessibility

00:35:15.526 --> 00:35:17.406 A:middle
identifier, you can simply set

00:35:17.406 --> 00:35:19.296 A:middle
the property on your UI control

00:35:19.296 --> 00:35:20.916 A:middle
when create it, or your NS

00:35:20.916 --> 00:35:21.286 A:middle
control.

00:35:23.086 --> 00:35:24.726 A:middle
Or if you're loading your UI

00:35:24.726 --> 00:35:26.486 A:middle
from a storyboard or a zip file

00:35:26.606 --> 00:35:28.016 A:middle
you can set it in the identity

00:35:28.016 --> 00:35:29.626 A:middle
inspector in interface builder.

00:35:30.226 --> 00:35:33.726 A:middle
So now that your tests are

00:35:33.726 --> 00:35:35.016 A:middle
localization friendly and

00:35:35.016 --> 00:35:36.566 A:middle
they're succeeding in all the

00:35:36.566 --> 00:35:37.756 A:middle
languages that you support,

00:35:38.776 --> 00:35:40.176 A:middle
there's even more that you can

00:35:40.176 --> 00:35:42.066 A:middle
do to take advantage of that.

00:35:42.906 --> 00:35:44.386 A:middle
We're introducing -- this year

00:35:44.436 --> 00:35:46.006 A:middle
we're introducing XCT attachment

00:35:46.006 --> 00:35:48.096 A:middle
APIs, which allow you to attach

00:35:48.226 --> 00:35:49.996 A:middle
screen shots as well as any

00:35:49.996 --> 00:35:51.616 A:middle
other data you collect during

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:54.466 A:middle
your test and it'll attach it to

00:35:54.586 --> 00:35:55.926 A:middle
your test report at the end.

00:35:56.766 --> 00:35:58.346 A:middle
What this empowers you to do is

00:35:58.346 --> 00:36:00.276 A:middle
get a full coverage of your UI.

00:36:00.906 --> 00:36:02.886 A:middle
So every screen in your app, in

00:36:02.886 --> 00:36:04.236 A:middle
every localization that you

00:36:04.236 --> 00:36:06.726 A:middle
support, as well as every device

00:36:06.726 --> 00:36:07.416 A:middle
that you support.

00:36:07.696 --> 00:36:09.116 A:middle
And you can do all that while

00:36:09.116 --> 00:36:11.786 A:middle
writing only one test -- well,

00:36:11.946 --> 00:36:13.836 A:middle
one test for each thing you want

00:36:14.936 --> 00:36:16.136 A:middle
to test.

00:36:16.136 --> 00:36:16.936 A:middle
[laughing] To find out more

00:36:16.936 --> 00:36:19.256 A:middle
about XCT attachment and what

00:36:19.256 --> 00:36:21.346 A:middle
else is new in testing please

00:36:21.396 --> 00:36:23.906 A:middle
see those related sessions

00:36:23.946 --> 00:36:24.596 A:middle
throughout the week.

00:36:26.636 --> 00:36:27.976 A:middle
And now I want to show you a

00:36:27.976 --> 00:36:29.406 A:middle
test that I've written for my

00:36:29.406 --> 00:36:29.946 A:middle
international facts app.

00:36:42.526 --> 00:36:45.046 A:middle
Okay. So in my Xcode project

00:36:45.276 --> 00:36:46.926 A:middle
I've already created this UI

00:36:46.926 --> 00:36:49.356 A:middle
test target and I wrote my first

00:36:49.356 --> 00:36:50.566 A:middle
test, called Test Some

00:36:50.566 --> 00:36:51.206 A:middle
Territories.

00:36:51.866 --> 00:36:53.186 A:middle
So let's run it to see what it

00:36:53.186 --> 00:36:53.896 A:middle
does exactly.

00:36:59.276 --> 00:37:00.986 A:middle
Now Xcode will launch my test

00:37:00.986 --> 00:37:05.926 A:middle
runner, which in turn launches

00:37:06.086 --> 00:37:07.466 A:middle
my app.

00:37:08.776 --> 00:37:11.196 A:middle
And in this specific test we

00:37:11.196 --> 00:37:12.736 A:middle
select a different territory, in

00:37:12.736 --> 00:37:14.666 A:middle
this case Belgium, and then the

00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:15.356 A:middle
test succeeds.

00:37:16.736 --> 00:37:19.046 A:middle
So now let's try running my test

00:37:19.046 --> 00:37:19.576 A:middle
in Russian.

00:37:19.786 --> 00:37:21.686 A:middle
And to do that I'll go into my

00:37:21.686 --> 00:37:24.416 A:middle
scheme and instead of "run" this

00:37:24.456 --> 00:37:25.836 A:middle
time we want to select "test"

00:37:26.646 --> 00:37:28.266 A:middle
and under language I'm going to

00:37:28.266 --> 00:37:29.886 A:middle
choose "Russian" so I can test

00:37:29.966 --> 00:37:31.756 A:middle
the new localization that Chris

00:37:31.926 --> 00:37:32.906 A:middle
added to my project.

00:37:37.046 --> 00:37:38.296 A:middle
Now again my test runner

00:37:38.296 --> 00:37:40.096 A:middle
launches, which launches my app.

00:37:42.396 --> 00:37:43.856 A:middle
And this time my app is launched

00:37:43.856 --> 00:37:48.726 A:middle
in Russian, but it looks like my

00:37:48.726 --> 00:37:49.506 A:middle
test failed.

00:37:50.076 --> 00:37:52.086 A:middle
So let's see what's going on.

00:37:52.796 --> 00:37:54.616 A:middle
And it looks like my test can't

00:37:54.616 --> 00:37:56.566 A:middle
find a cell that has "territory"

00:37:56.566 --> 00:37:57.616 A:middle
in it, which is what we just

00:37:57.616 --> 00:37:58.216 A:middle
talked about.

00:37:58.696 --> 00:38:02.736 A:middle
Silly me. So -- oops, sorry.

00:38:09.046 --> 00:38:11.436 A:middle
So in my project I'm going to go

00:38:11.436 --> 00:38:13.066 A:middle
back to my main table view

00:38:13.066 --> 00:38:14.416 A:middle
controller and make sure that

00:38:14.416 --> 00:38:15.646 A:middle
I'm setting an accessibility

00:38:15.646 --> 00:38:18.876 A:middle
identifier for my territory

00:38:18.876 --> 00:38:20.666 A:middle
picker cell so I can actually

00:38:20.666 --> 00:38:21.176 A:middle
select it.

00:38:21.776 --> 00:38:24.606 A:middle
So when I create my cell I also

00:38:24.606 --> 00:38:26.186 A:middle
want to give it an identifier.

00:38:26.296 --> 00:38:29.296 A:middle
So territory picker cell.

00:38:30.596 --> 00:38:31.956 A:middle
And I want to use the same

00:38:31.956 --> 00:38:33.466 A:middle
identifier in my test.

00:38:35.636 --> 00:38:37.296 A:middle
So where it's failing, instead

00:38:37.296 --> 00:38:40.316 A:middle
of using static text I'll simply

00:38:40.316 --> 00:38:41.496 A:middle
replace it with this identifier

00:38:41.496 --> 00:38:41.976 A:middle
that I just created.

00:38:48.106 --> 00:38:49.476 A:middle
And now I'll try to run my test

00:38:49.476 --> 00:38:50.406 A:middle
again in Russian using the

00:38:50.656 --> 00:38:50.976 A:middle
identifiers.

00:38:59.076 --> 00:39:00.046 A:middle
As you can see, my app launches

00:39:00.046 --> 00:39:01.606 A:middle
in Russian again, but this time

00:39:01.606 --> 00:39:03.426 A:middle
it actually got further and it

00:39:03.536 --> 00:39:05.416 A:middle
chose Belgium as the country and

00:39:05.416 --> 00:39:06.236 A:middle
the text succeeded.

00:39:07.406 --> 00:39:08.526 A:middle
So I just want to show you what

00:39:08.526 --> 00:39:09.736 A:middle
my test does exactly.

00:39:10.376 --> 00:39:11.656 A:middle
First, I want to validate some

00:39:11.656 --> 00:39:12.836 A:middle
of -- some functionality.

00:39:12.836 --> 00:39:14.856 A:middle
So I have this XCT assert equal

00:39:14.856 --> 00:39:16.456 A:middle
to make sure that my app

00:39:16.456 --> 00:39:18.496 A:middle
initially launches with the US

00:39:18.496 --> 00:39:21.466 A:middle
selected and then I use the XCT

00:39:21.466 --> 00:39:24.856 A:middle
attachment APIs to collect

00:39:24.946 --> 00:39:25.536 A:middle
screen shots.

00:39:25.686 --> 00:39:27.756 A:middle
So my first screen shot is a

00:39:27.756 --> 00:39:30.446 A:middle
screen shot of the US page.

00:39:31.316 --> 00:39:33.196 A:middle
And I add it to my test case and

00:39:33.566 --> 00:39:35.186 A:middle
then I collect more screen shots

00:39:35.186 --> 00:39:37.786 A:middle
later when I open the territory

00:39:37.786 --> 00:39:39.496 A:middle
list and after I've selected

00:39:39.546 --> 00:39:39.896 A:middle
Belgium.

00:39:41.026 --> 00:39:42.766 A:middle
And now finally if I want to see

00:39:42.766 --> 00:39:44.876 A:middle
these attachments I can simply

00:39:44.876 --> 00:39:46.886 A:middle
go to the "reports" navigator in

00:39:46.886 --> 00:39:50.096 A:middle
the sidebar and select my most

00:39:50.096 --> 00:39:51.366 A:middle
recent test that I've run.

00:39:51.996 --> 00:39:54.656 A:middle
And then if I expand my test

00:39:54.716 --> 00:39:57.926 A:middle
some territories test case,

00:39:58.446 --> 00:39:59.666 A:middle
you'll see that some of these

00:39:59.666 --> 00:40:01.626 A:middle
lines have the attachment icon

00:40:01.626 --> 00:40:02.536 A:middle
on them.

00:40:02.536 --> 00:40:03.586 A:middle
And these are the attachments

00:40:03.806 --> 00:40:04.926 A:middle
that I've created.

00:40:05.186 --> 00:40:07.006 A:middle
So as I've mentioned, they're

00:40:07.006 --> 00:40:08.356 A:middle
all screen shots in this case.

00:40:09.066 --> 00:40:10.856 A:middle
And there's so much that I can

00:40:10.856 --> 00:40:12.086 A:middle
do with these attachments.

00:40:12.536 --> 00:40:14.076 A:middle
I can bundle them up and send

00:40:14.076 --> 00:40:16.426 A:middle
them to somebody to ensure the

00:40:16.426 --> 00:40:18.046 A:middle
quality of my translations,

00:40:18.046 --> 00:40:19.186 A:middle
somebody who actually speaks

00:40:19.186 --> 00:40:20.446 A:middle
these different localizations --

00:40:20.916 --> 00:40:22.446 A:middle
and to make sure the UI looks

00:40:22.516 --> 00:40:24.856 A:middle
good and the formatters are

00:40:24.856 --> 00:40:25.256 A:middle
correct.

00:40:26.166 --> 00:40:28.146 A:middle
And I can even use these screen

00:40:28.146 --> 00:40:29.926 A:middle
shots in my app store preview

00:40:30.766 --> 00:40:32.346 A:middle
when I want to launch my app in

00:40:32.346 --> 00:40:33.626 A:middle
all these different storefronts

00:40:33.626 --> 00:40:35.356 A:middle
around the world so that users

00:40:35.426 --> 00:40:36.816 A:middle
can get a preview of what your

00:40:36.816 --> 00:40:37.746 A:middle
app will look like in their

00:40:37.746 --> 00:40:37.976 A:middle
language.

00:40:43.476 --> 00:40:45.966 A:middle
So, I show you how with one test

00:40:46.606 --> 00:40:48.636 A:middle
you can test every single

00:40:48.636 --> 00:40:50.186 A:middle
localization that you add in

00:40:50.186 --> 00:40:50.616 A:middle
your apps.

00:40:51.356 --> 00:40:52.816 A:middle
And to summarize what we talked

00:40:52.816 --> 00:40:55.036 A:middle
about today, we covered the

00:40:55.036 --> 00:40:57.156 A:middle
localization process for an app.

00:40:58.426 --> 00:40:59.976 A:middle
First, you need to prepare your

00:41:00.016 --> 00:41:01.556 A:middle
code for localization, and

00:41:01.556 --> 00:41:02.886 A:middle
that's the internationalization

00:41:02.886 --> 00:41:03.146 A:middle
steps.

00:41:03.146 --> 00:41:06.056 A:middle
And then we showed you ways you

00:41:06.056 --> 00:41:07.936 A:middle
can validate your apps readiness

00:41:08.296 --> 00:41:10.586 A:middle
including the static analyzer

00:41:10.586 --> 00:41:13.346 A:middle
and auto layout warnings and the

00:41:13.346 --> 00:41:14.346 A:middle
new pseudo languages.

00:41:15.976 --> 00:41:18.636 A:middle
And then you can export your --

00:41:18.636 --> 00:41:20.136 A:middle
all your localizable content

00:41:20.136 --> 00:41:21.386 A:middle
into a single XLIFF.

00:41:21.836 --> 00:41:23.236 A:middle
And now that includes string

00:41:23.236 --> 00:41:24.666 A:middle
dict files, which are really

00:41:24.666 --> 00:41:26.536 A:middle
powerful for handling plurals

00:41:26.536 --> 00:41:27.616 A:middle
and adaptive strings.

00:41:29.036 --> 00:41:30.666 A:middle
And finally, when your XLIFF is

00:41:30.726 --> 00:41:32.676 A:middle
translated you can import it

00:41:32.676 --> 00:41:34.326 A:middle
back into your project and that

00:41:34.326 --> 00:41:36.026 A:middle
integrates the translations into

00:41:36.026 --> 00:41:37.496 A:middle
all the different pieces of your

00:41:37.496 --> 00:41:37.606 A:middle
app.

00:41:39.326 --> 00:41:40.656 A:middle
And then you can take advantage

00:41:40.656 --> 00:41:42.896 A:middle
of your existing tests to run

00:41:42.896 --> 00:41:44.776 A:middle
them in all your supported

00:41:44.776 --> 00:41:45.636 A:middle
localizations.

00:41:45.856 --> 00:41:47.106 A:middle
And you can take advantage of

00:41:47.106 --> 00:41:48.896 A:middle
the new XCT attachments to do a

00:41:48.896 --> 00:41:51.266 A:middle
lot more than test your app's

00:41:51.266 --> 00:41:51.906 A:middle
functionality.

00:41:53.606 --> 00:41:54.796 A:middle

00:41:54.796 --> 00:41:56.556 A:middle
session is 401, and you can

00:42:02.496 --> 00:42:03.816 A:middle
related sessions throughout the

00:42:03.816 --> 00:42:04.146 A:middle
week.

00:42:05.726 --> 00:42:06.556 A:middle
Thank you and enjoy the rest of

00:42:06.556 --> 00:42:06.976 A:middle
