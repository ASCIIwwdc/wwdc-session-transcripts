00:00:24.136 --> 00:00:25.206 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon everybody.

00:00:25.206 --> 00:00:26.116 A:middle
Hello to everybody who's still

00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:26.436 A:middle
here.

00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:29.756 A:middle
I'm Steve Hayman.

00:00:29.756 --> 00:00:30.926 A:middle
I'm a consulting engineer from

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:31.726 A:middle
Toronto, Canada.

00:00:31.726 --> 00:00:32.496 A:middle
Any Canadians here?

00:00:32.736 --> 00:00:34.456 A:middle
Good. How's it going, eh?

00:00:34.886 --> 00:00:36.496 A:middle
I'd like to say hello to those

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:37.906 A:middle
of you who are still here late

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:38.936 A:middle
on Friday afternoon.

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:41.076 A:middle
And to everyone who's watching

00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:43.126 A:middle
the video in the future, hello

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.656 A:middle
people in the future with the

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:46.186 A:middle
flying cars and everything.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.506 A:middle
I'm very excited to see what

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:48.536 A:middle
that turns out to be.

00:00:49.176 --> 00:00:50.646 A:middle
But today we have the thrilling

00:00:50.646 --> 00:00:52.986 A:middle
topic of iOS Configuration and

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:55.516 A:middle
APIs for Kiosk and Assessment

00:00:55.516 --> 00:00:55.826 A:middle
Apps.

00:00:56.626 --> 00:00:58.346 A:middle
What are we talking about?

00:00:58.756 --> 00:01:00.316 A:middle
We're talking about locking an

00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:02.696 A:middle
iPad to a single application.

00:01:03.256 --> 00:01:04.066 A:middle
We're going to talk about

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.756 A:middle
different ways that you might do

00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:05.926 A:middle
that.

00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:07.016 A:middle
Some of them are manual

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:07.776 A:middle
processes.

00:01:08.136 --> 00:01:09.136 A:middle
Some of them are programmatic.

00:01:09.476 --> 00:01:10.486 A:middle
But let me show you a couple of

00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:13.326 A:middle
examples of what we're talking

00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:15.016 A:middle
about right now.

00:01:19.376 --> 00:01:20.446 A:middle
So here's my iPad.

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.476 A:middle
Here's one thing you can do.

00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:25.506 A:middle
Anybody can do this on any iPad.

00:01:25.506 --> 00:01:26.946 A:middle
Anybody can go to Settings,

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:30.996 A:middle
General, Accessibility, way down

00:01:30.996 --> 00:01:32.436 A:middle
at bottom, Guided Access.

00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:34.756 A:middle
And if you turn this on, it is

00:01:34.756 --> 00:01:36.726 A:middle
now possible to lock an iPad,

00:01:36.726 --> 00:01:38.726 A:middle
any iPad, to any arbitrary

00:01:39.086 --> 00:01:39.676 A:middle
application.

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:41.566 A:middle
A lot of parents and teachers do

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:42.766 A:middle
this before they turn over their

00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:43.816 A:middle
iPad to their child.

00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:45.446 A:middle
For instance, if your child was

00:01:45.446 --> 00:01:47.296 A:middle
very interested in maps, you

00:01:47.296 --> 00:01:49.336 A:middle
could launch Maps, and then

00:01:49.336 --> 00:01:50.546 A:middle
since Guided Access is on, you

00:01:50.546 --> 00:01:51.696 A:middle
can triple tap, one, two, three

00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:55.036 A:middle
times, on the Home button, and

00:01:55.036 --> 00:01:56.406 A:middle
supply a pass code.

00:01:56.406 --> 00:01:59.046 A:middle
A very secret pass code.

00:01:59.156 --> 00:01:59.676 A:middle
No guessing.

00:01:59.676 --> 00:02:00.476 A:middle
[sound effects].

00:02:00.476 --> 00:02:04.976 A:middle
And now I can hand the iPad to

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:07.106 A:middle
my geography-obsessed child, and

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:08.146 A:middle
they can play with Maps all day

00:02:08.146 --> 00:02:09.406 A:middle
long, but they can't touch the

00:02:09.406 --> 00:02:09.846 A:middle
Home button.

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:11.216 A:middle
They can't get out and start

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:14.006 A:middle
messing with my stuff, until I

00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:15.076 A:middle
triple tap the Home button

00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:17.136 A:middle
again, one, two, three, and put

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:18.986 A:middle
in the pass code.

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:21.166 A:middle
So this is Guided Access.

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:22.746 A:middle
This is an accessibility

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:23.926 A:middle
technology from Apple that's

00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:25.046 A:middle
been around for a long time.

00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:27.546 A:middle
It's a basic way to lock an iPad

00:02:27.696 --> 00:02:29.326 A:middle
to any application that you

00:02:29.326 --> 00:02:29.596 A:middle
want.

00:02:29.786 --> 00:02:30.696 A:middle
That's one way, but I want to

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:31.286 A:middle
show you another way.

00:02:31.286 --> 00:02:32.076 A:middle
We're all developers.

00:02:32.076 --> 00:02:33.206 A:middle
Let's talk about a programmatic

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:34.346 A:middle
way to do this.

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:38.516 A:middle
I have a testing application on

00:02:38.516 --> 00:02:40.636 A:middle
here that you might see in a

00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:41.686 A:middle
school for administering

00:02:41.686 --> 00:02:42.466 A:middle
standardized tests.

00:02:43.406 --> 00:02:44.906 A:middle
And in schools, we are a little

00:02:44.906 --> 00:02:46.496 A:middle
bit concerned about letting

00:02:46.496 --> 00:02:47.816 A:middle
students touch the Home button,

00:02:47.816 --> 00:02:49.216 A:middle
and fire up Safari, and go to

00:02:49.216 --> 00:02:50.296 A:middle
Wikipedia during the test.

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:51.016 A:middle
We don't really want that

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:51.576 A:middle
happening.

00:02:52.236 --> 00:02:53.586 A:middle
So an application like this one,

00:02:53.586 --> 00:02:55.196 A:middle
when I tap Start Test, we're not

00:02:55.196 --> 00:02:56.076 A:middle
locked right at the moment.

00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:57.046 A:middle
I can still hit the Home button.

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:59.456 A:middle
But once I touch Start Test,

00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:02.186 A:middle
this particular app is set up to

00:03:02.186 --> 00:03:04.046 A:middle
lock iOS on demand, at the

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:05.226 A:middle
moment I touch that button.

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:06.176 A:middle
You get a little panel here that

00:03:06.176 --> 00:03:07.316 A:middle
says, "Do you want to confirm

00:03:07.316 --> 00:03:08.296 A:middle
app self lock?"

00:03:08.296 --> 00:03:11.046 A:middle
And if I say yes, the test

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:11.586 A:middle
begins.

00:03:12.116 --> 00:03:13.736 A:middle
The Home button is now locked.

00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:15.236 A:middle
It was locked by some code that

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:16.656 A:middle
I'll show you at exactly this

00:03:16.686 --> 00:03:16.926 A:middle
point.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.466 A:middle
And I can't cheat in the test.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:21.396 A:middle
I can't hit the Home button to

00:03:21.396 --> 00:03:21.736 A:middle
get out.

00:03:21.736 --> 00:03:23.566 A:middle
I can submit my answer here,

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:25.536 A:middle
Ottawa.

00:03:25.536 --> 00:03:26.916 A:middle
And at the moment I hit Submit,

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.876 A:middle
this particular app unlocks iOS.

00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:31.686 A:middle
So there's a function we're

00:03:31.686 --> 00:03:32.396 A:middle
going to tell you about that

00:03:32.396 --> 00:03:33.586 A:middle
turns the locking on and off.

00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:35.366 A:middle
So now I'm back to a point where

00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:36.326 A:middle
I can hit the Home button.

00:03:36.876 --> 00:03:38.456 A:middle
So those are two different

00:03:38.456 --> 00:03:39.056 A:middle
approaches.

00:03:39.056 --> 00:03:42.796 A:middle
One of them a fairly manual

00:03:42.796 --> 00:03:44.326 A:middle
approach, Guided Access, walking

00:03:44.326 --> 00:03:45.416 A:middle
around and actually triple

00:03:45.416 --> 00:03:46.276 A:middle
tapping on a device.

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:46.966 A:middle
And then the other one is a

00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:48.116 A:middle
programmatic approach, which I

00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:49.316 A:middle
think you would agree is a

00:03:49.316 --> 00:03:50.146 A:middle
little more flexible.

00:03:51.016 --> 00:03:52.456 A:middle
Those are two ways.

00:03:52.456 --> 00:03:53.356 A:middle
I'm going to talk about four

00:03:53.356 --> 00:03:54.836 A:middle
ways that you might lock an

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:55.356 A:middle
application.

00:03:55.626 --> 00:03:57.696 A:middle
One that we just saw was Guided

00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:58.136 A:middle
Access.

00:03:58.136 --> 00:03:59.526 A:middle
This is a great technology for

00:03:59.526 --> 00:04:01.676 A:middle
keeping a child, for instance,

00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:03.476 A:middle
focused on a certain task.

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:05.866 A:middle
You can lock your child into

00:04:05.866 --> 00:04:07.336 A:middle
Swift Playgrounds and not let

00:04:07.336 --> 00:04:08.616 A:middle
them out until they can explain

00:04:08.616 --> 00:04:10.156 A:middle
the difference between a struct

00:04:10.156 --> 00:04:11.516 A:middle
and a class, for instance.

00:04:11.596 --> 00:04:13.486 A:middle
Whatever scenario you want, you

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:14.936 A:middle
can lock a child to a particular

00:04:15.216 --> 00:04:15.846 A:middle
application.

00:04:17.226 --> 00:04:18.176 A:middle
There's another technology

00:04:18.176 --> 00:04:19.846 A:middle
you'll often see in Kiosks,

00:04:19.936 --> 00:04:20.806 A:middle
single app mode.

00:04:20.806 --> 00:04:22.336 A:middle
This is useful to keep the iPad

00:04:22.746 --> 00:04:24.596 A:middle
pretty much permanently locked

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:25.706 A:middle
to a particular application.

00:04:26.226 --> 00:04:27.426 A:middle
You've probably seen this if

00:04:27.426 --> 00:04:28.556 A:middle
you've gone to an Apple store.

00:04:28.556 --> 00:04:29.886 A:middle
There's some iPads on display

00:04:29.886 --> 00:04:31.296 A:middle
that are permanently running an

00:04:31.296 --> 00:04:32.746 A:middle
information application, and you

00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:33.716 A:middle
can't get out.

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:35.936 A:middle
But there are two techniques

00:04:35.936 --> 00:04:37.186 A:middle
available to programmers.

00:04:37.186 --> 00:04:38.616 A:middle
The first is called autonomous

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:40.016 A:middle
single app mode.

00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:42.296 A:middle
Picture a situation where you

00:04:42.296 --> 00:04:43.656 A:middle
have a medical clinic, and the

00:04:43.656 --> 00:04:46.066 A:middle
nurse is using an application

00:04:46.136 --> 00:04:47.536 A:middle
with confidential information on

00:04:47.536 --> 00:04:49.116 A:middle
it, and then a patient arrives.

00:04:49.116 --> 00:04:50.416 A:middle
You'd like to hand them the iPad

00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:52.166 A:middle
to check in and have it locked

00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:53.636 A:middle
during that little transaction

00:04:53.946 --> 00:04:55.146 A:middle
and have it unlocked when you

00:04:55.146 --> 00:04:56.416 A:middle
get it back so that they can't

00:04:56.416 --> 00:04:57.296 A:middle
hit the Home button and mess

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:58.766 A:middle
around during one section of

00:04:58.766 --> 00:04:59.366 A:middle
your application.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.726 A:middle
That's called autonomous single

00:05:01.726 --> 00:05:02.186 A:middle
app mode.

00:05:02.186 --> 00:05:03.446 A:middle
It's a single app mode where

00:05:03.446 --> 00:05:04.856 A:middle
locking takes place, but it's

00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:05.986 A:middle
autonomous, because it's your

00:05:05.986 --> 00:05:07.286 A:middle
application that decides when

00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:08.336 A:middle
the right time is.

00:05:09.046 --> 00:05:10.176 A:middle
And there's a fourth mode

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:11.866 A:middle
specifically designed for the

00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:13.306 A:middle
education community for people

00:05:13.306 --> 00:05:14.476 A:middle
building standardized test

00:05:14.476 --> 00:05:15.806 A:middle
applications, automatic

00:05:15.806 --> 00:05:16.816 A:middle
assessment configuration.

00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:18.986 A:middle
This is for students taking a

00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:21.446 A:middle
high stakes test, and it locks

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.356 A:middle
the iPad, but it also disables

00:05:23.396 --> 00:05:25.036 A:middle
some additional features, like

00:05:25.036 --> 00:05:26.356 A:middle
spellchecking, and auto correct,

00:05:26.356 --> 00:05:28.166 A:middle
and Siri that you would not want

00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:29.276 A:middle
a student to be using on a test.

00:05:29.276 --> 00:05:30.176 A:middle
We're going to talk about these

00:05:30.176 --> 00:05:31.396 A:middle
four scenarios.

00:05:31.676 --> 00:05:32.586 A:middle
They each have different

00:05:33.306 --> 00:05:34.276 A:middle
technical requirements.

00:05:34.926 --> 00:05:36.236 A:middle
Guided Access really just works

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:37.456 A:middle
on any iPad at all.

00:05:37.456 --> 00:05:38.776 A:middle
Anybody can walk up, and turn it

00:05:38.776 --> 00:05:40.506 A:middle
on, and triple tap to enable it.

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.876 A:middle
It's a very widely available

00:05:42.436 --> 00:05:42.926 A:middle
technology.

00:05:43.646 --> 00:05:44.776 A:middle
Single app mode that you would

00:05:44.776 --> 00:05:45.976 A:middle
see with Kiosks, this is

00:05:45.976 --> 00:05:47.506 A:middle
something that only works on a

00:05:47.506 --> 00:05:50.626 A:middle
managed and supervised device.

00:05:50.676 --> 00:05:51.966 A:middle
So it won't work on the

00:05:51.966 --> 00:05:53.326 A:middle
run-of-the-mill, bring your own

00:05:53.396 --> 00:05:54.086 A:middle
iPad from home.

00:05:54.086 --> 00:05:55.396 A:middle
It works only on a managed

00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:57.456 A:middle
device, and it requires support

00:05:57.986 --> 00:06:00.356 A:middle
from MDM and from the system

00:06:00.356 --> 00:06:01.016 A:middle
administrator.

00:06:01.246 --> 00:06:02.436 A:middle
Somebody has to designate

00:06:02.436 --> 00:06:04.436 A:middle
exactly which apps, exactly

00:06:04.436 --> 00:06:05.616 A:middle
which single app, we're going to

00:06:05.616 --> 00:06:07.636 A:middle
lock right now.

00:06:08.246 --> 00:06:09.526 A:middle
Autonomous single app mode, much

00:06:09.526 --> 00:06:10.186 A:middle
more flexible.

00:06:10.496 --> 00:06:12.526 A:middle
It still requires supervised

00:06:12.916 --> 00:06:15.336 A:middle
devices, and it requires the

00:06:15.726 --> 00:06:17.376 A:middle
administrator to white list

00:06:17.426 --> 00:06:19.216 A:middle
specific applications, but now

00:06:19.216 --> 00:06:20.346 A:middle
it means that the iPad can

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:20.766 A:middle
decide.

00:06:20.806 --> 00:06:22.276 A:middle
Your app can decide when to turn

00:06:22.596 --> 00:06:23.916 A:middle
the locking on and when to turn

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:24.536 A:middle
it off.

00:06:25.476 --> 00:06:26.366 A:middle
And finally, the last one,

00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:27.166 A:middle
automatic assessment

00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:28.506 A:middle
configuration, is the best for

00:06:28.506 --> 00:06:29.756 A:middle
assessment developers because it

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:31.666 A:middle
locks the iPad and it also

00:06:31.666 --> 00:06:33.756 A:middle
disables a whole variety of

00:06:33.756 --> 00:06:35.226 A:middle
features that creative students

00:06:35.226 --> 00:06:37.286 A:middle
might use to enhance their ways

00:06:37.286 --> 00:06:40.486 A:middle
to answer questions on a test.

00:06:40.486 --> 00:06:41.586 A:middle
That automatic assessment

00:06:41.586 --> 00:06:43.336 A:middle
configuration requires a special

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.776 A:middle
entitlement that you can apply

00:06:44.866 --> 00:06:45.866 A:middle
from Apple, but once you've got

00:06:45.866 --> 00:06:47.676 A:middle
that entitlement, your app can

00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:49.996 A:middle
lock any device, whether it's

00:06:49.996 --> 00:06:52.086 A:middle
managed or not.

00:06:52.646 --> 00:06:53.596 A:middle
So locking an iPad

00:06:53.596 --> 00:06:54.246 A:middle
programmatically.

00:06:54.826 --> 00:06:55.696 A:middle
Several different ways.

00:06:56.076 --> 00:06:58.236 A:middle
Guided access, we saw a moment

00:06:58.236 --> 00:06:59.576 A:middle
ago, is a great way to focus a

00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:01.976 A:middle
child on a particular task, and

00:07:01.976 --> 00:07:04.176 A:middle
it has some obvious advantages.

00:07:04.176 --> 00:07:05.196 A:middle
Anybody can set it up.

00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:06.556 A:middle
It's very easy to set up.

00:07:07.466 --> 00:07:09.336 A:middle
And a couple of concerns.

00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:11.556 A:middle
It's not a particularly scalable

00:07:11.636 --> 00:07:12.856 A:middle
way to do anything, because you

00:07:12.856 --> 00:07:14.066 A:middle
have to walk around and actually

00:07:14.096 --> 00:07:15.646 A:middle
touch every iPad.

00:07:15.646 --> 00:07:17.156 A:middle
If you have hundreds of students

00:07:17.156 --> 00:07:18.676 A:middle
who are about to take a test,

00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:19.826 A:middle
someone would have to walk

00:07:19.826 --> 00:07:20.976 A:middle
around and touch the Home button

00:07:20.976 --> 00:07:22.326 A:middle
three times on each of the 100

00:07:22.326 --> 00:07:22.836 A:middle
devices.

00:07:22.836 --> 00:07:24.346 A:middle
That doesn't scale very well,

00:07:24.346 --> 00:07:26.136 A:middle
plus you have to manage a pass

00:07:26.136 --> 00:07:26.356 A:middle
code.

00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:27.406 A:middle
So it's great for some

00:07:27.406 --> 00:07:28.906 A:middle
situations, but not others.

00:07:30.196 --> 00:07:31.446 A:middle
Single app mode that you might

00:07:31.446 --> 00:07:33.406 A:middle
do with a kiosk brings a level

00:07:33.406 --> 00:07:34.926 A:middle
of remote control to this

00:07:35.196 --> 00:07:35.716 A:middle
process.

00:07:36.036 --> 00:07:37.226 A:middle
If you have iPads where there's

00:07:37.226 --> 00:07:38.546 A:middle
only one application that you

00:07:38.546 --> 00:07:40.546 A:middle
might ever want to run, maybe

00:07:40.546 --> 00:07:41.726 A:middle
something that displays train

00:07:41.726 --> 00:07:43.336 A:middle
schedules or conference room

00:07:43.336 --> 00:07:45.866 A:middle
reservations, an admin can push

00:07:45.916 --> 00:07:48.196 A:middle
a command to a managed iPad to

00:07:48.196 --> 00:07:49.976 A:middle
lock it right now to that

00:07:49.976 --> 00:07:50.506 A:middle
application.

00:07:50.506 --> 00:07:51.696 A:middle
In fact, you can lock hundreds

00:07:51.836 --> 00:07:53.386 A:middle
or thousands of applications of

00:07:53.386 --> 00:07:54.966 A:middle
iPads simultaneously.

00:07:55.356 --> 00:07:57.986 A:middle
Here's what it might look like.

00:07:58.306 --> 00:07:59.396 A:middle
Let's suppose you have some sort

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:01.026 A:middle
of a tourism kiosk, and you want

00:08:01.026 --> 00:08:02.356 A:middle
your iPad to run this

00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:03.976 A:middle
application only.

00:08:05.376 --> 00:08:08.156 A:middle
An administrator using an MDM

00:08:08.156 --> 00:08:12.376 A:middle
tool, which specify that your

00:08:12.376 --> 00:08:14.636 A:middle
application is the one that's

00:08:14.636 --> 00:08:15.796 A:middle
allowed to do single app mode,

00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:16.886 A:middle
and then the moment they push

00:08:16.886 --> 00:08:18.406 A:middle
this configuration out, the iPad

00:08:18.406 --> 00:08:19.536 A:middle
immediately launches that app,

00:08:19.536 --> 00:08:21.216 A:middle
and it stays in that app.

00:08:21.776 --> 00:08:22.736 A:middle
If you reboot the device, it

00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:24.186 A:middle
goes back to the kiosk

00:08:24.186 --> 00:08:24.936 A:middle
application again.

00:08:24.936 --> 00:08:25.956 A:middle
This is a good way to pretty

00:08:25.956 --> 00:08:28.186 A:middle
much permanently lock an iPad to

00:08:28.186 --> 00:08:29.126 A:middle
a particular application.

00:08:29.396 --> 00:08:30.596 A:middle
The way you get out of this is

00:08:30.596 --> 00:08:31.946 A:middle
to push a new command from the

00:08:31.946 --> 00:08:34.486 A:middle
Admin Console to remove this

00:08:34.486 --> 00:08:35.886 A:middle
single app mode setting.

00:08:37.576 --> 00:08:39.486 A:middle
Very useful to lock thousands of

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:41.116 A:middle
devices simultaneously and more

00:08:41.116 --> 00:08:43.176 A:middle
or less permanently, but it does

00:08:43.176 --> 00:08:44.926 A:middle
require IT involvement.

00:08:45.166 --> 00:08:47.406 A:middle
We have seen situations where

00:08:47.406 --> 00:08:48.826 A:middle
people have forgotten to unlock

00:08:48.826 --> 00:08:51.566 A:middle
the iPads via this technology.

00:08:51.566 --> 00:08:52.716 A:middle
If you were a school, and you

00:08:52.716 --> 00:08:54.836 A:middle
locked all the iPads to the math

00:08:54.836 --> 00:08:56.126 A:middle
test, and you forgot to unlock

00:08:56.126 --> 00:08:57.406 A:middle
them, now nobody can do anything

00:08:57.766 --> 00:08:58.956 A:middle
until you remember to push out

00:08:58.956 --> 00:08:59.616 A:middle
that next command.

00:09:00.276 --> 00:09:01.746 A:middle
It does require a supervised

00:09:01.746 --> 00:09:04.376 A:middle
device managed by MDM, and I

00:09:04.376 --> 00:09:05.806 A:middle
would say the main downside to

00:09:05.806 --> 00:09:06.936 A:middle
this is that developers really

00:09:06.936 --> 00:09:07.936 A:middle
have no control.

00:09:08.656 --> 00:09:09.756 A:middle
When you lock with single app

00:09:09.756 --> 00:09:11.056 A:middle
mode, the device immediately

00:09:11.056 --> 00:09:12.376 A:middle
locks, we're stuck in that

00:09:12.376 --> 00:09:12.956 A:middle
application.

00:09:13.236 --> 00:09:13.666 A:middle
Not very [inaudible].

00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:16.786 A:middle
Wouldn't it be interesting if --

00:09:16.786 --> 00:09:19.296 A:middle
wouldn't it be great if, as a

00:09:19.296 --> 00:09:20.746 A:middle
developer, you could control

00:09:20.746 --> 00:09:22.706 A:middle
exactly when that locking

00:09:22.706 --> 00:09:23.136 A:middle
happened?

00:09:23.716 --> 00:09:25.006 A:middle
Like, for instance, if you had a

00:09:25.006 --> 00:09:26.916 A:middle
medical practice like this, with

00:09:26.916 --> 00:09:28.596 A:middle
a patient management application

00:09:28.596 --> 00:09:29.516 A:middle
full of confidential

00:09:29.516 --> 00:09:31.256 A:middle
information, when the patient

00:09:31.256 --> 00:09:32.576 A:middle
arrives, wouldn't it be great if

00:09:32.576 --> 00:09:33.826 A:middle
you could hand them the iPad,

00:09:34.126 --> 00:09:36.306 A:middle
touch that button, and know that

00:09:36.306 --> 00:09:38.566 A:middle
the iPad is locked, the Home

00:09:38.566 --> 00:09:39.926 A:middle
button does not work while we

00:09:39.926 --> 00:09:41.416 A:middle
are on this screen.

00:09:42.056 --> 00:09:43.506 A:middle
And then once the patient fills

00:09:43.506 --> 00:09:45.016 A:middle
in all their information, they

00:09:45.596 --> 00:09:48.636 A:middle
might touch Check In, hand the

00:09:48.636 --> 00:09:51.276 A:middle
iPad back to me, and now it

00:09:51.276 --> 00:09:53.096 A:middle
could be unlocked, and we would

00:09:53.096 --> 00:09:54.646 A:middle
regain full control.

00:09:54.996 --> 00:09:57.366 A:middle
Wouldn't it be great if clicking

00:09:57.366 --> 00:09:58.596 A:middle
that button right there, right

00:09:59.696 --> 00:10:00.686 A:middle
there, wouldn't it be great if

00:10:00.686 --> 00:10:01.776 A:middle
clicking that button right there

00:10:01.776 --> 00:10:02.966 A:middle
turned locking on?

00:10:03.556 --> 00:10:03.956 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah!

00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:05.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, you're right.

00:10:05.186 --> 00:10:05.876 A:middle
It would be great.

00:10:05.876 --> 00:10:06.476 A:middle
Wouldn't that be great?

00:10:06.476 --> 00:10:07.136 A:middle
What about this side?

00:10:07.136 --> 00:10:09.636 A:middle
This side, you think that would

00:10:09.636 --> 00:10:09.866 A:middle
be great?

00:10:09.866 --> 00:10:09.933 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:09.933 --> 00:10:10.696 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would be kind of

00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:11.266 A:middle
cool, wouldn't it?

00:10:11.266 --> 00:10:13.026 A:middle
Well, you know what, have we got

00:10:13.026 --> 00:10:13.826 A:middle
a function for you.

00:10:13.826 --> 00:10:15.506 A:middle
Well, as a matter of fact, that

00:10:15.506 --> 00:10:16.626 A:middle
would be great, and we do have a

00:10:16.626 --> 00:10:17.256 A:middle
function for you.

00:10:17.256 --> 00:10:18.706 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:10:18.706 --> 00:10:20.156 A:middle
.

00:10:20.156 --> 00:10:23.586 A:middle
And here it is.

00:10:24.026 --> 00:10:25.716 A:middle
UIAccessibilityRequest

00:10:25.716 --> 00:10:27.556 A:middle
GuidedAccessSession.

00:10:28.436 --> 00:10:29.736 A:middle
Nice, easy-to-remember function.

00:10:29.736 --> 00:10:31.146 A:middle
UIAccessibilityRequest

00:10:31.146 --> 00:10:32.656 A:middle
GuidedAccessSession.

00:10:32.996 --> 00:10:34.566 A:middle
That turns locking on and off.

00:10:35.416 --> 00:10:36.276 A:middle
Here's another function.

00:10:36.276 --> 00:10:37.886 A:middle
Is Guided Access Enabled?

00:10:37.886 --> 00:10:38.466 A:middle
It's a Boolean.

00:10:38.466 --> 00:10:39.406 A:middle
Is it on or off?

00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:39.896 A:middle
You can check.

00:10:39.896 --> 00:10:42.106 A:middle
And there's a notification

00:10:42.156 --> 00:10:43.016 A:middle
you've asked for.

00:10:43.016 --> 00:10:44.176 A:middle
You can be alerted when the

00:10:44.356 --> 00:10:45.156 A:middle
status changes.

00:10:45.336 --> 00:10:46.306 A:middle
But mostly, there's this

00:10:46.306 --> 00:10:46.806 A:middle
function here,

00:10:46.806 --> 00:10:48.336 A:middle
UIAccessibilityRequest

00:10:48.826 --> 00:10:49.776 A:middle
GuidedAccessSession.

00:10:49.776 --> 00:10:50.726 A:middle
This is the key.

00:10:51.216 --> 00:10:52.896 A:middle
If your device and your

00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:54.696 A:middle
application are set up the right

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:55.846 A:middle
way, and there is some setup

00:10:55.846 --> 00:10:57.876 A:middle
required, then your app can call

00:10:57.876 --> 00:10:59.556 A:middle
this function lock the iPad

00:10:59.866 --> 00:11:00.826 A:middle
right now, and it can call it

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:01.356 A:middle
again to unlock.

00:11:01.356 --> 00:11:02.236 A:middle
And let me underline that.

00:11:02.466 --> 00:11:05.576 A:middle
If the iPad and your application

00:11:05.576 --> 00:11:08.016 A:middle
are set up the right way, this

00:11:08.086 --> 00:11:09.356 A:middle
is a powerful function that is

00:11:09.356 --> 00:11:10.616 A:middle
not available to all

00:11:10.616 --> 00:11:11.346 A:middle
applications.

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:13.806 A:middle
Adding the code is important,

00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:14.706 A:middle
but there's some other steps you

00:11:14.706 --> 00:11:15.326 A:middle
actually have to do.

00:11:15.326 --> 00:11:17.786 A:middle
So speaking of code, let's see

00:11:17.786 --> 00:11:19.626 A:middle
some code.

00:11:19.826 --> 00:11:21.356 A:middle
You would call this function to

00:11:21.356 --> 00:11:23.246 A:middle
start a locking session.

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:25.976 A:middle
You would pass it either true or

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:26.556 A:middle
false.

00:11:26.556 --> 00:11:27.216 A:middle
Do you want to lock?

00:11:27.216 --> 00:11:28.466 A:middle
Do you want to unlock?

00:11:29.676 --> 00:11:30.926 A:middle
And you would also give it a

00:11:30.926 --> 00:11:32.236 A:middle
completion handler that would be

00:11:32.236 --> 00:11:33.516 A:middle
called when your request

00:11:34.196 --> 00:11:34.626 A:middle
completes.

00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:35.846 A:middle
It can take a second or two for

00:11:35.846 --> 00:11:37.526 A:middle
the locking to take effect, so

00:11:37.526 --> 00:11:39.116 A:middle
you pass a completion handler,

00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:41.506 A:middle
and your completion handler gets

00:11:41.506 --> 00:11:43.156 A:middle
a Boolean parameter that

00:11:43.156 --> 00:11:44.576 A:middle
indicates whether the request

00:11:44.896 --> 00:11:45.866 A:middle
succeeded or not.

00:11:46.546 --> 00:11:47.956 A:middle
It's possible that the request

00:11:47.956 --> 00:11:49.196 A:middle
could fail, and so you want to

00:11:49.196 --> 00:11:50.066 A:middle
actually check that.

00:11:50.066 --> 00:11:52.326 A:middle
But if all goes well, you can

00:11:52.326 --> 00:11:54.406 A:middle
check if the request succeed and

00:11:54.406 --> 00:11:56.106 A:middle
now do something with the

00:11:56.106 --> 00:11:57.326 A:middle
confidence that the iPad is

00:11:57.406 --> 00:11:58.466 A:middle
locked at this point, and the

00:11:58.466 --> 00:11:59.826 A:middle
Home button is disabled.

00:12:00.596 --> 00:12:01.676 A:middle
So in our hypothetical medical

00:12:01.676 --> 00:12:03.276 A:middle
example, let's suppose we have a

00:12:03.616 --> 00:12:04.796 A:middle
function like this that loads

00:12:04.796 --> 00:12:05.876 A:middle
New View Controller with a

00:12:05.876 --> 00:12:07.346 A:middle
patient check-in screen on in.

00:12:07.756 --> 00:12:09.276 A:middle
you could wrap that in code like

00:12:09.276 --> 00:12:11.396 A:middle
this, and then that transition

00:12:11.396 --> 00:12:13.266 A:middle
would only happen if the device

00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:14.836 A:middle
had been locked successfully.

00:12:15.736 --> 00:12:17.106 A:middle
Then when the patient is done,

00:12:17.106 --> 00:12:18.346 A:middle
you've got some other function

00:12:18.346 --> 00:12:19.336 A:middle
that transitions back to the

00:12:19.336 --> 00:12:20.536 A:middle
main screen, you would put

00:12:20.536 --> 00:12:21.436 A:middle
something like this in here.

00:12:21.436 --> 00:12:21.796 A:middle
You would say

00:12:21.796 --> 00:12:23.256 A:middle
UIAccessibilityRequest

00:12:23.256 --> 00:12:25.746 A:middle
GuidedAccessSession false, and

00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:28.246 A:middle
that's a request to turn off at

00:12:28.246 --> 00:12:30.386 A:middle
app lock at that point.

00:12:31.916 --> 00:12:32.856 A:middle
There's another one you can

00:12:32.856 --> 00:12:33.406 A:middle
call.

00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:34.806 A:middle
Is Guided Access enabled, true

00:12:34.806 --> 00:12:35.306 A:middle
or false?

00:12:35.306 --> 00:12:36.566 A:middle
You can do some extra checks.

00:12:37.176 --> 00:12:38.126 A:middle
You can check at any time

00:12:38.126 --> 00:12:38.866 A:middle
whether you're currently in a

00:12:38.866 --> 00:12:40.426 A:middle
locked state or not.

00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:42.016 A:middle
There's also a notification,

00:12:42.016 --> 00:12:43.636 A:middle
UIAccessibilityRequest

00:12:43.636 --> 00:12:45.696 A:middle
GuidedAccessStatusDidChange, and

00:12:45.696 --> 00:12:46.766 A:middle
you can register for this, and

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:47.796 A:middle
your app can be notified

00:12:47.796 --> 00:12:50.016 A:middle
anywhere as the status turns on

00:12:50.016 --> 00:12:50.276 A:middle
and off.

00:12:51.356 --> 00:12:53.336 A:middle
So all this technology taken

00:12:53.336 --> 00:12:54.836 A:middle
together is called autonomous

00:12:55.196 --> 00:12:56.826 A:middle
single app mode, ASAM.

00:12:57.586 --> 00:12:59.136 A:middle
It's like single app mode, but

00:12:59.136 --> 00:13:00.256 A:middle
it's autonomous, because your

00:13:00.256 --> 00:13:01.876 A:middle
app can control exactly when the

00:13:01.876 --> 00:13:03.056 A:middle
locking and unlocking takes

00:13:03.056 --> 00:13:03.366 A:middle
place.

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.476 A:middle
You can lock just part of an

00:13:04.476 --> 00:13:05.016 A:middle
application.

00:13:05.286 --> 00:13:07.596 A:middle
Now for this to work, iPads do

00:13:07.596 --> 00:13:08.766 A:middle
need to be set up in a

00:13:08.766 --> 00:13:09.346 A:middle
particular way.

00:13:09.346 --> 00:13:10.496 A:middle
Let's talk about the

00:13:10.646 --> 00:13:11.156 A:middle
requirements.

00:13:11.156 --> 00:13:12.246 A:middle
The first requirement, you have

00:13:12.246 --> 00:13:12.886 A:middle
to write the code.

00:13:12.886 --> 00:13:14.186 A:middle
You have to call that function.

00:13:14.806 --> 00:13:16.136 A:middle
Second requirement, the devices

00:13:16.136 --> 00:13:17.936 A:middle
have to be supervised, which is

00:13:17.936 --> 00:13:19.746 A:middle
a sort of extreme form of iOS

00:13:19.746 --> 00:13:20.206 A:middle
management.

00:13:21.056 --> 00:13:22.796 A:middle
And thirdly, your app needs to

00:13:22.796 --> 00:13:24.596 A:middle
be white listed by the MDM

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:25.496 A:middle
administrator.

00:13:25.536 --> 00:13:27.026 A:middle
The administrator can grant

00:13:27.026 --> 00:13:28.706 A:middle
permission to call this function

00:13:28.706 --> 00:13:30.256 A:middle
only to certain applications.

00:13:31.556 --> 00:13:33.216 A:middle
So here's what an admin would

00:13:33.216 --> 00:13:33.506 A:middle
do.

00:13:33.506 --> 00:13:36.396 A:middle
In an MDM tool, there's a place

00:13:36.396 --> 00:13:37.676 A:middle
where you can mark which

00:13:37.676 --> 00:13:40.066 A:middle
applications are allowed to

00:13:40.066 --> 00:13:41.826 A:middle
enter and exit single app mode.

00:13:42.346 --> 00:13:43.516 A:middle
Only the applications on this

00:13:43.516 --> 00:13:46.346 A:middle
list will allow that function to

00:13:46.346 --> 00:13:46.606 A:middle
work.

00:13:46.686 --> 00:13:48.116 A:middle
So you'd list exactly which apps

00:13:48.116 --> 00:13:49.116 A:middle
are allowed to use it here.

00:13:49.286 --> 00:13:50.666 A:middle
And remember, this only works on

00:13:50.666 --> 00:13:52.886 A:middle
supervised iPads, not iPads that

00:13:52.886 --> 00:13:55.636 A:middle
people are bringing from home.

00:13:55.636 --> 00:13:58.096 A:middle
Ultimately, this converts to a

00:13:58.096 --> 00:13:59.236 A:middle
particular key and value in a

00:13:59.236 --> 00:14:00.316 A:middle
configuration profile.

00:14:00.316 --> 00:14:01.816 A:middle
The bundle IDs of all the apps

00:14:01.816 --> 00:14:02.776 A:middle
that are authorized to do this,

00:14:02.776 --> 00:14:03.626 A:middle
that's transmitted to the

00:14:03.626 --> 00:14:04.066 A:middle
device.

00:14:04.936 --> 00:14:06.136 A:middle
And once that configuration is

00:14:06.136 --> 00:14:07.456 A:middle
set up, your app can actually

00:14:07.456 --> 00:14:08.596 A:middle
call that function and turn the

00:14:08.596 --> 00:14:11.446 A:middle
locking on and off, and you have

00:14:11.446 --> 00:14:11.816 A:middle
control.

00:14:11.816 --> 00:14:13.756 A:middle
It's autonomous single app mode.

00:14:13.756 --> 00:14:14.746 A:middle
You can prevent people from

00:14:14.746 --> 00:14:15.716 A:middle
accidentally getting or

00:14:15.716 --> 00:14:17.196 A:middle
deliberately getting out of the

00:14:17.196 --> 00:14:17.766 A:middle
application.

00:14:18.996 --> 00:14:20.846 A:middle
However, there are a couple of

00:14:20.946 --> 00:14:21.446 A:middle
issues.

00:14:21.446 --> 00:14:23.236 A:middle
It does require an MDM managed

00:14:23.236 --> 00:14:26.076 A:middle
and supervised device, and the

00:14:26.076 --> 00:14:26.936 A:middle
IT department has to

00:14:26.936 --> 00:14:29.486 A:middle
specifically white list your

00:14:29.486 --> 00:14:30.586 A:middle
application, grant it

00:14:30.896 --> 00:14:31.326 A:middle
permission.

00:14:31.866 --> 00:14:34.006 A:middle
And all this is really onerous

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:35.276 A:middle
in some situations.

00:14:35.276 --> 00:14:37.636 A:middle
It's ideal for the patient

00:14:37.636 --> 00:14:39.156 A:middle
check-in scenario or the

00:14:39.156 --> 00:14:41.236 A:middle
scenario with the bank where the

00:14:41.236 --> 00:14:42.716 A:middle
mortgage specialist is handing

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:43.786 A:middle
you the iPad to fill in your

00:14:43.786 --> 00:14:44.276 A:middle
information.

00:14:44.276 --> 00:14:45.176 A:middle
We want to lock it right then.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:46.016 A:middle
It's great for that kind of

00:14:46.016 --> 00:14:47.656 A:middle
scenario, but it's not really

00:14:48.066 --> 00:14:50.356 A:middle
robust enough for assessment,

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:51.106 A:middle
for testing.

00:14:52.096 --> 00:14:53.686 A:middle
Testing has its own set of

00:14:54.156 --> 00:14:54.696 A:middle
requirements.

00:14:54.696 --> 00:14:56.396 A:middle
If you're delivering a test to a

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:57.546 A:middle
large group of students, it's a

00:14:57.546 --> 00:14:59.456 A:middle
kind of a high-stakes scenario.

00:14:59.456 --> 00:15:00.756 A:middle
Not only are the students going

00:15:00.756 --> 00:15:03.276 A:middle
to be judged on their knowledge,

00:15:03.676 --> 00:15:05.236 A:middle
but the teacher and the school

00:15:05.236 --> 00:15:06.206 A:middle
are going to be judged on the

00:15:06.206 --> 00:15:06.916 A:middle
results as well.

00:15:06.916 --> 00:15:07.876 A:middle
So it's important that we

00:15:07.876 --> 00:15:09.696 A:middle
deliver a test in an application

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.206 A:middle
with the highest possible

00:15:11.296 --> 00:15:11.876 A:middle
integrity.

00:15:12.356 --> 00:15:14.656 A:middle
We don't want students cheating.

00:15:14.656 --> 00:15:15.356 A:middle
That's what we're talking about

00:15:15.356 --> 00:15:15.476 A:middle
here.

00:15:15.476 --> 00:15:16.636 A:middle
We want to make it hard for

00:15:16.636 --> 00:15:17.356 A:middle
students to cheat.

00:15:17.906 --> 00:15:19.516 A:middle
These three technologies are

00:15:19.516 --> 00:15:20.866 A:middle
useful in other scenarios, but

00:15:20.866 --> 00:15:23.086 A:middle
not in an assessment scenario,

00:15:23.086 --> 00:15:24.216 A:middle
because they leave certain

00:15:24.216 --> 00:15:26.356 A:middle
features running, like

00:15:26.536 --> 00:15:27.646 A:middle
spellchecking and then the

00:15:27.646 --> 00:15:28.766 A:middle
dictionary lookups and so.

00:15:28.766 --> 00:15:29.756 A:middle
Those are still running in these

00:15:29.756 --> 00:15:31.086 A:middle
other scenarios, and you

00:15:31.086 --> 00:15:32.256 A:middle
wouldn't want that in a test.

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:34.466 A:middle
So Apple recommends automatic

00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:36.056 A:middle
assessment configuration as the

00:15:36.056 --> 00:15:38.156 A:middle
method that a test builder

00:15:39.226 --> 00:15:40.166 A:middle
should adopt.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.346 A:middle
What is it?

00:15:42.676 --> 00:15:43.766 A:middle
Well, assessment apps have

00:15:43.836 --> 00:15:44.856 A:middle
unique challenges.

00:15:44.856 --> 00:15:46.236 A:middle
That are a whole lot of very

00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:48.906 A:middle
useful features on iPad that are

00:15:49.456 --> 00:15:51.126 A:middle
not appropriate when a test is

00:15:51.126 --> 00:15:52.286 A:middle
actually running.

00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:54.166 A:middle
In order to protect the

00:15:54.166 --> 00:15:55.576 A:middle
integrity of the test, we're

00:15:55.576 --> 00:15:56.826 A:middle
going to want to disable things

00:15:56.826 --> 00:15:59.656 A:middle
like copying and pasting from

00:15:59.656 --> 00:16:01.166 A:middle
outside the test into the test.

00:16:01.406 --> 00:16:02.526 A:middle
We're going to want to disable,

00:16:02.526 --> 00:16:03.846 A:middle
obviously, other applications.

00:16:03.846 --> 00:16:04.816 A:middle
But we're also going to want to

00:16:04.816 --> 00:16:06.526 A:middle
disable spellchecking on an

00:16:06.526 --> 00:16:07.486 A:middle
English test, and we're going to

00:16:07.486 --> 00:16:08.606 A:middle
want to disable the built-in

00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:09.616 A:middle
dictionary.

00:16:09.616 --> 00:16:11.186 A:middle
So you need to be able to

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:13.346 A:middle
disable certain hardware

00:16:13.346 --> 00:16:16.336 A:middle
features to run a secure test,

00:16:17.266 --> 00:16:18.026 A:middle
and you might not have

00:16:18.026 --> 00:16:19.036 A:middle
considered this, but you also

00:16:19.036 --> 00:16:21.396 A:middle
need to disable sharing off the

00:16:21.396 --> 00:16:21.666 A:middle
iPad.

00:16:21.666 --> 00:16:23.096 A:middle
We can't have a student copying

00:16:23.096 --> 00:16:26.566 A:middle
all the questions and using the

00:16:26.566 --> 00:16:27.856 A:middle
Share menu to ship them off to

00:16:27.856 --> 00:16:29.166 A:middle
another iPad of another student

00:16:29.166 --> 00:16:29.506 A:middle
outside.

00:16:29.506 --> 00:16:30.446 A:middle
We need to turn off that

00:16:30.446 --> 00:16:31.766 A:middle
universal clipboard as well.

00:16:31.766 --> 00:16:33.676 A:middle
In fact, we need to turn off a

00:16:33.676 --> 00:16:34.426 A:middle
whole lot of things.

00:16:34.916 --> 00:16:36.166 A:middle
You really do need to turn off

00:16:36.166 --> 00:16:37.316 A:middle
all these features like this to

00:16:37.316 --> 00:16:39.266 A:middle
run a safe and secure test.

00:16:39.856 --> 00:16:42.586 A:middle
This combination of locking iOS,

00:16:42.586 --> 00:16:44.816 A:middle
as I showed you before, plus

00:16:45.316 --> 00:16:46.536 A:middle
automatically disabling all

00:16:46.536 --> 00:16:48.606 A:middle
these features is called

00:16:48.606 --> 00:16:49.476 A:middle
automatic assessment

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:50.076 A:middle
configuration.

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:53.546 A:middle
Now AAC, automatic assessment

00:16:53.546 --> 00:16:55.436 A:middle
configuration, works just the

00:16:55.436 --> 00:16:56.916 A:middle
way I showed you with ASAM.

00:16:56.916 --> 00:16:58.256 A:middle
It's the exact same function.

00:16:58.256 --> 00:16:59.316 A:middle
You call a function true to

00:16:59.316 --> 00:17:00.796 A:middle
lock, false to unlock.

00:17:00.796 --> 00:17:01.616 A:middle
You check the status.

00:17:02.216 --> 00:17:03.536 A:middle
Exactly the same process right

00:17:03.536 --> 00:17:03.706 A:middle
there.

00:17:04.386 --> 00:17:05.776 A:middle
But in addition, the moment you

00:17:06.156 --> 00:17:07.736 A:middle
lock with this function, all

00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:08.806 A:middle
these features are going to be

00:17:08.806 --> 00:17:10.656 A:middle
automatically disabled for the

00:17:10.656 --> 00:17:12.276 A:middle
duration of your test, and when

00:17:12.276 --> 00:17:13.316 A:middle
you call the unlock function,

00:17:13.816 --> 00:17:15.016 A:middle
they're all enabled.

00:17:17.616 --> 00:17:19.156 A:middle
There is a requirement here.

00:17:20.216 --> 00:17:22.916 A:middle
This works on any iPad, whether

00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:24.516 A:middle
it's managed or not, but it's a

00:17:24.516 --> 00:17:25.726 A:middle
pretty powerful technique, so

00:17:25.726 --> 00:17:26.996 A:middle
you need to have a special

00:17:26.996 --> 00:17:29.016 A:middle
entitlement in your application

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:30.336 A:middle
before that request will

00:17:30.336 --> 00:17:30.816 A:middle
succeed.

00:17:31.836 --> 00:17:32.726 A:middle
Technically, the request is

00:17:32.726 --> 00:17:34.246 A:middle
called com.apple.developer.

00:17:34.246 --> 00:17:35.546 A:middle
edu-assessment-mode.

00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:38.096 A:middle
You need to apply to Apple for

00:17:38.096 --> 00:17:39.516 A:middle
this entitlement, and once you

00:17:39.516 --> 00:17:40.686 A:middle
have it, your application will

00:17:40.686 --> 00:17:42.856 A:middle
be able to lock and unlock with

00:17:42.856 --> 00:17:44.556 A:middle
no need for a supervised device

00:17:44.906 --> 00:17:46.036 A:middle
and no need for white listing.

00:17:46.406 --> 00:17:47.576 A:middle
Your app needs to be built with

00:17:47.576 --> 00:17:48.936 A:middle
a profile that includes this

00:17:49.196 --> 00:17:50.036 A:middle
special entitlement.

00:17:50.356 --> 00:17:52.996 A:middle
And once it locks, well, how

00:17:52.996 --> 00:17:53.616 A:middle
does it unlock?

00:17:53.616 --> 00:17:55.666 A:middle
Well, the device is locked.

00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:56.756 A:middle
Normally, it would unlock,

00:17:56.756 --> 00:17:57.876 A:middle
because at the end of the test,

00:17:57.876 --> 00:17:58.996 A:middle
you would call the function that

00:17:58.996 --> 00:18:01.346 A:middle
says false, time to end our

00:18:01.566 --> 00:18:02.266 A:middle
session, the student has

00:18:02.266 --> 00:18:03.006 A:middle
submitted the answers.

00:18:04.026 --> 00:18:05.706 A:middle
But the iPad also unlocks if the

00:18:05.706 --> 00:18:06.486 A:middle
user reboots it.

00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:07.676 A:middle
This isn't like single app mode

00:18:07.676 --> 00:18:08.916 A:middle
where we permanently keep you in

00:18:08.916 --> 00:18:09.416 A:middle
a device.

00:18:09.786 --> 00:18:11.326 A:middle
It's a temporary single app

00:18:11.326 --> 00:18:11.526 A:middle
mode.

00:18:12.086 --> 00:18:13.966 A:middle
And it also unlocks after eight

00:18:13.966 --> 00:18:14.396 A:middle
hours.

00:18:14.866 --> 00:18:17.166 A:middle
This is a -- if you are

00:18:17.166 --> 00:18:19.356 A:middle
administering a particular long

00:18:19.356 --> 00:18:20.676 A:middle
test, you might want to be aware

00:18:20.676 --> 00:18:20.976 A:middle
of this.

00:18:20.976 --> 00:18:22.456 A:middle
You will get a notification that

00:18:22.456 --> 00:18:23.896 A:middle
the locked status has changed,

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:24.806 A:middle
and you could take that

00:18:24.806 --> 00:18:25.996 A:middle
opportunity to lock it again.

00:18:26.966 --> 00:18:28.426 A:middle
Let me know if you're creating a

00:18:28.466 --> 00:18:29.706 A:middle
test that takes eight hours to

00:18:29.706 --> 00:18:30.086 A:middle
finish.

00:18:30.086 --> 00:18:31.026 A:middle
I do not want to write that

00:18:31.026 --> 00:18:31.696 A:middle
particular test.

00:18:32.336 --> 00:18:34.126 A:middle
But what people see when they're

00:18:34.126 --> 00:18:35.406 A:middle
doing this is this.

00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:37.166 A:middle
This is a sample application.

00:18:37.166 --> 00:18:38.566 A:middle
There's sample code associated

00:18:38.566 --> 00:18:39.406 A:middle
with this session that you can

00:18:39.406 --> 00:18:39.806 A:middle
download.

00:18:40.016 --> 00:18:41.596 A:middle
Two buttons that turn locking on

00:18:41.596 --> 00:18:41.876 A:middle
and off.

00:18:42.356 --> 00:18:43.886 A:middle
This app was built with the

00:18:43.886 --> 00:18:45.256 A:middle
right entitlement, and there's a

00:18:45.256 --> 00:18:46.496 A:middle
text field where you can try

00:18:46.496 --> 00:18:47.856 A:middle
typing to see if spellchecking

00:18:47.856 --> 00:18:49.346 A:middle
works, and there's a log of what

00:18:50.806 --> 00:18:51.456 A:middle
happens.

00:18:51.456 --> 00:18:54.016 A:middle
When you tap the Enable App Lock

00:18:54.116 --> 00:18:56.156 A:middle
here and call that function I've

00:18:56.156 --> 00:18:57.856 A:middle
been talking about, this panel

00:18:57.856 --> 00:18:59.116 A:middle
is automatically displayed.

00:18:59.116 --> 00:19:00.926 A:middle
The gives the user the

00:19:00.926 --> 00:19:02.236 A:middle
opportunity to say yes or no,

00:19:02.236 --> 00:19:03.166 A:middle
they are willing to enter the

00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:04.256 A:middle
lock session.

00:19:04.706 --> 00:19:08.746 A:middle
And if they tap yes, a banner

00:19:08.746 --> 00:19:09.906 A:middle
automatically appears at the top

00:19:09.906 --> 00:19:10.936 A:middle
that says your iPad is now

00:19:10.936 --> 00:19:12.196 A:middle
locked, and it's going to unlock

00:19:12.196 --> 00:19:13.486 A:middle
after eight hours or when you

00:19:13.936 --> 00:19:15.336 A:middle
finish the test, and then that

00:19:15.336 --> 00:19:16.856 A:middle
goes away after five seconds.

00:19:18.136 --> 00:19:19.736 A:middle
Now the iPad is locked until

00:19:19.736 --> 00:19:21.846 A:middle
such time as somebody runs,

00:19:22.006 --> 00:19:23.426 A:middle
calls the function to unlock.

00:19:23.596 --> 00:19:25.106 A:middle
In this demo app, tapping the

00:19:25.106 --> 00:19:26.706 A:middle
red button calls the unlock

00:19:26.706 --> 00:19:27.636 A:middle
function, then you get another

00:19:27.636 --> 00:19:28.656 A:middle
banner across the top.

00:19:28.656 --> 00:19:30.376 A:middle
"Your iPad is no longer locked."

00:19:30.766 --> 00:19:31.616 A:middle
In between the green and the

00:19:31.616 --> 00:19:33.016 A:middle
red, the Home button was

00:19:33.436 --> 00:19:34.916 A:middle
successful disabled, and this is

00:19:34.916 --> 00:19:36.696 A:middle
a pretty simple sample

00:19:36.806 --> 00:19:37.706 A:middle
application.

00:19:37.756 --> 00:19:39.736 A:middle
Just two buttons with two action

00:19:39.736 --> 00:19:40.056 A:middle
methods.

00:19:40.056 --> 00:19:41.676 A:middle
One calls the function with true

00:19:41.676 --> 00:19:42.166 A:middle
to lock.

00:19:42.166 --> 00:19:43.816 A:middle
The other one says false to

00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:44.116 A:middle
unlock.

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:46.606 A:middle
Let's talk about some of the

00:19:46.606 --> 00:19:47.836 A:middle
considerations in here.

00:19:47.836 --> 00:19:48.796 A:middle
It's pretty good that the apps

00:19:48.796 --> 00:19:50.096 A:middle
can lock and unlock themselves,

00:19:50.096 --> 00:19:51.346 A:middle
and it's great for assessment,

00:19:51.346 --> 00:19:52.416 A:middle
that all these other features,

00:19:52.416 --> 00:19:53.176 A:middle
like spell check, are

00:19:53.176 --> 00:19:54.416 A:middle
automatically turned off in

00:19:54.416 --> 00:19:55.816 A:middle
addition to the locking.

00:19:55.816 --> 00:19:56.666 A:middle
You, the developer, have

00:19:56.666 --> 00:19:58.246 A:middle
control, and this doesn't

00:19:58.246 --> 00:19:59.936 A:middle
require a managed device.

00:20:00.136 --> 00:20:01.366 A:middle
In a school situation, this will

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:02.586 A:middle
work on a device the student

00:20:02.586 --> 00:20:03.846 A:middle
brings from home.

00:20:04.756 --> 00:20:06.946 A:middle
However, you do need this

00:20:06.946 --> 00:20:09.336 A:middle
particular app entitlement in

00:20:09.336 --> 00:20:10.496 A:middle
your application, and this

00:20:10.496 --> 00:20:12.106 A:middle
entitlement is only for

00:20:12.406 --> 00:20:14.156 A:middle
assessment developers.

00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:17.236 A:middle
How would you implement this in

00:20:17.236 --> 00:20:17.446 A:middle
your app?

00:20:17.446 --> 00:20:18.316 A:middle
Well, the first step is to

00:20:18.316 --> 00:20:20.646 A:middle
actually apply to Apple for this

00:20:20.646 --> 00:20:21.486 A:middle
entitlement, which will be

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:22.996 A:middle
granted to assessment developers

00:20:22.996 --> 00:20:24.016 A:middle
but not to anybody else, and

00:20:24.526 --> 00:20:25.586 A:middle
then you build a provisioning

00:20:25.586 --> 00:20:26.746 A:middle
profile that includes that

00:20:26.746 --> 00:20:28.276 A:middle
entitlement, and build your app

00:20:28.276 --> 00:20:28.956 A:middle
with that profile.

00:20:29.386 --> 00:20:30.796 A:middle
The way you ask for this

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:32.966 A:middle
entitlement is to submit a tech

00:20:32.966 --> 00:20:34.786 A:middle
support incident, and tell us,

00:20:34.786 --> 00:20:35.766 A:middle
tell Apple that you would like

00:20:35.766 --> 00:20:36.986 A:middle
the education assessment mode

00:20:37.426 --> 00:20:37.886 A:middle
entitlement.

00:20:38.486 --> 00:20:39.896 A:middle
And then once that's been

00:20:39.896 --> 00:20:42.076 A:middle
granted to you, you can go to

00:20:42.076 --> 00:20:43.766 A:middle
the developer portal and build a

00:20:43.766 --> 00:20:46.576 A:middle
new profile that includes that

00:20:46.576 --> 00:20:47.076 A:middle
entitlement.

00:20:47.076 --> 00:20:48.616 A:middle
You will only see this selection

00:20:48.616 --> 00:20:49.706 A:middle
here if you've been granted the

00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:50.586 A:middle
entitlement, and you can now

00:20:50.586 --> 00:20:51.736 A:middle
build a provisioning profile

00:20:51.736 --> 00:20:53.226 A:middle
that has this special

00:20:53.226 --> 00:20:55.486 A:middle
entitlement in it.

00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:56.676 A:middle
Don't forget this step.

00:20:56.676 --> 00:20:57.626 A:middle
It's not enough for Apple to

00:20:57.626 --> 00:20:58.586 A:middle
grant you the entitlement.

00:20:58.586 --> 00:20:59.716 A:middle
You have to create a profile

00:20:59.716 --> 00:21:01.296 A:middle
that has it embedded, and

00:21:01.296 --> 00:21:03.196 A:middle
download it, and use it in

00:21:04.356 --> 00:21:04.606 A:middle
Xcode.

00:21:05.106 --> 00:21:07.486 A:middle
Also, don't forget that you want

00:21:07.486 --> 00:21:08.386 A:middle
to apply this to several

00:21:08.386 --> 00:21:09.276 A:middle
different profiles.

00:21:09.276 --> 00:21:10.356 A:middle
It's not enough just to put the

00:21:10.356 --> 00:21:11.986 A:middle
entitlement in your development

00:21:11.986 --> 00:21:12.356 A:middle
profile.

00:21:12.356 --> 00:21:12.926 A:middle
You should put it in the

00:21:12.926 --> 00:21:14.476 A:middle
distribution one, and if you've

00:21:14.476 --> 00:21:15.616 A:middle
done it correctly, you should

00:21:15.616 --> 00:21:19.066 A:middle
see here in Xcode, once you

00:21:19.066 --> 00:21:20.296 A:middle
select a profile with this

00:21:20.296 --> 00:21:21.926 A:middle
entitlement in it, you can touch

00:21:21.926 --> 00:21:23.356 A:middle
that little info button, and you

00:21:23.356 --> 00:21:24.336 A:middle
can see the entitlements that

00:21:24.336 --> 00:21:24.986 A:middle
are built in here.

00:21:24.986 --> 00:21:25.896 A:middle
That's the way to confirm that

00:21:25.896 --> 00:21:26.656 A:middle
you're doing this right.

00:21:26.656 --> 00:21:27.826 A:middle
If you see that magic string

00:21:27.826 --> 00:21:29.856 A:middle
there, com.apple.developer.

00:21:30.216 --> 00:21:31.976 A:middle
edu-assessment-mode, you're good

00:21:31.976 --> 00:21:32.236 A:middle
to go.

00:21:32.236 --> 00:21:33.546 A:middle
You can now build an application

00:21:33.546 --> 00:21:35.166 A:middle
that actually uses this

00:21:35.166 --> 00:21:35.606 A:middle
technology.

00:21:37.856 --> 00:21:38.876 A:middle
When would you do it?

00:21:38.876 --> 00:21:39.696 A:middle
Well, when you're ready to enter

00:21:39.696 --> 00:21:41.106 A:middle
the test, you'd call the magic

00:21:41.106 --> 00:21:42.006 A:middle
function with true, and when

00:21:42.006 --> 00:21:42.646 A:middle
you're ready to get out of the

00:21:42.646 --> 00:21:43.926 A:middle
test, you'd call it with false,

00:21:43.926 --> 00:21:45.396 A:middle
and it's very important to check

00:21:45.396 --> 00:21:46.236 A:middle
whether it worked or not,

00:21:46.236 --> 00:21:46.816 A:middle
because there were some

00:21:46.816 --> 00:21:47.946 A:middle
scenarios where it can fail.

00:21:47.946 --> 00:21:49.236 A:middle
I'm going to try actually doing

00:21:49.236 --> 00:21:49.346 A:middle
this.

00:21:49.456 --> 00:21:50.166 A:middle
I'm going to try actually

00:21:50.166 --> 00:21:51.366 A:middle
building something that they

00:21:51.366 --> 00:21:51.926 A:middle
used this year.

00:21:51.926 --> 00:21:55.266 A:middle
Take my life in my hands here.

00:21:55.446 --> 00:21:58.686 A:middle
So you remember this testing

00:21:58.686 --> 00:21:59.666 A:middle
application that I showed you

00:21:59.666 --> 00:22:00.126 A:middle
before.

00:22:00.576 --> 00:22:02.206 A:middle
I have a secure version and an

00:22:02.206 --> 00:22:03.696 A:middle
insecure version of it on this

00:22:03.696 --> 00:22:03.966 A:middle
iPad.

00:22:04.046 --> 00:22:05.286 A:middle
I'm going to show you the

00:22:05.286 --> 00:22:06.516 A:middle
insecure version, just to

00:22:06.516 --> 00:22:07.796 A:middle
highlight some of the problems

00:22:07.796 --> 00:22:09.016 A:middle
that might come up in a test,

00:22:09.446 --> 00:22:10.906 A:middle
then I'm going to change the

00:22:11.126 --> 00:22:13.166 A:middle
insecure version into the secure

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:13.456 A:middle
version.

00:22:15.496 --> 00:22:16.776 A:middle
This is the insecure version of

00:22:16.776 --> 00:22:17.626 A:middle
the test.

00:22:18.166 --> 00:22:19.726 A:middle
If I touch Start Test, I could

00:22:20.066 --> 00:22:21.426 A:middle
do all kinds of cheating things.

00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:23.826 A:middle
I could look up Canada in the

00:22:23.826 --> 00:22:24.486 A:middle
built-in dictionary.

00:22:24.486 --> 00:22:25.226 A:middle
Oh, there's the capitol right

00:22:25.226 --> 00:22:25.356 A:middle
there.

00:22:25.356 --> 00:22:25.776 A:middle
It's Ottawa.

00:22:25.776 --> 00:22:27.016 A:middle
That's pretty good.

00:22:27.326 --> 00:22:29.036 A:middle
Let's assume that we've blocked

00:22:29.036 --> 00:22:29.636 A:middle
the Home button.

00:22:29.636 --> 00:22:30.666 A:middle
Even if we've blocked the Home

00:22:30.666 --> 00:22:31.716 A:middle
button, a lot of other stuff is

00:22:31.806 --> 00:22:32.186 A:middle
possible.

00:22:32.186 --> 00:22:33.526 A:middle
If I type my answer up here,

00:22:33.526 --> 00:22:35.786 A:middle
O-T-T, I'm getting suggestions

00:22:36.246 --> 00:22:37.486 A:middle
in the completion bar that

00:22:37.486 --> 00:22:39.376 A:middle
happen to include the correct

00:22:39.376 --> 00:22:39.806 A:middle
answer.

00:22:39.806 --> 00:22:41.616 A:middle
You'd probably like to disable

00:22:41.846 --> 00:22:43.096 A:middle
that in a test as well.

00:22:43.456 --> 00:22:47.366 A:middle
You should probably disable the

00:22:48.326 --> 00:22:48.896 A:middle
share sheet.

00:22:48.896 --> 00:22:50.726 A:middle
We do not want students sending

00:22:50.726 --> 00:22:52.936 A:middle
the questions to their friends

00:22:53.266 --> 00:22:53.816 A:middle
somewhere else.

00:22:53.816 --> 00:22:54.866 A:middle
All this stuff needs to be

00:22:54.866 --> 00:22:56.856 A:middle
disabled in addition to the Home

00:22:56.856 --> 00:22:57.026 A:middle
button.

00:22:57.026 --> 00:22:58.346 A:middle
I mean, my Home button's still

00:22:58.346 --> 00:22:58.686 A:middle
working here.

00:22:58.686 --> 00:22:59.486 A:middle
That's the first problem.

00:22:59.976 --> 00:23:00.706 A:middle
So I'm going to show you the

00:23:00.706 --> 00:23:01.736 A:middle
code for this particular

00:23:01.736 --> 00:23:04.106 A:middle
application here, and then we're

00:23:04.106 --> 00:23:05.646 A:middle
going to try turning this into a

00:23:05.646 --> 00:23:06.686 A:middle
secure version.

00:23:07.116 --> 00:23:09.716 A:middle
So this is really a "nothing

00:23:09.716 --> 00:23:09.956 A:middle
app."

00:23:09.956 --> 00:23:11.046 A:middle
I put no effort into this

00:23:11.046 --> 00:23:11.756 A:middle
application at all.

00:23:11.756 --> 00:23:12.456 A:middle
It's a couple of view

00:23:12.456 --> 00:23:13.626 A:middle
controllers, and we touch the

00:23:13.626 --> 00:23:14.796 A:middle
Start the Test button, and it

00:23:14.796 --> 00:23:16.766 A:middle
loads another view controller

00:23:16.766 --> 00:23:17.086 A:middle
right here.

00:23:17.086 --> 00:23:19.626 A:middle
That's the time that we want to

00:23:19.626 --> 00:23:20.756 A:middle
turn locking on.

00:23:21.296 --> 00:23:22.816 A:middle
There are, however, a few

00:23:23.156 --> 00:23:24.936 A:middle
prerequisites that you have to

00:23:25.376 --> 00:23:26.776 A:middle
do before you can do this

00:23:26.996 --> 00:23:27.786 A:middle
locking dance.

00:23:28.396 --> 00:23:31.596 A:middle
First of all, you have to have a

00:23:31.596 --> 00:23:32.696 A:middle
provisioning profile with the

00:23:32.696 --> 00:23:33.636 A:middle
right entitlement in it.

00:23:33.636 --> 00:23:34.886 A:middle
You have to have applied to

00:23:34.886 --> 00:23:36.696 A:middle
Apple for this entitlement, and

00:23:36.696 --> 00:23:38.006 A:middle
generated a provision profile

00:23:38.006 --> 00:23:38.626 A:middle
that includes it.

00:23:39.436 --> 00:23:40.806 A:middle
I fortunately have done that, so

00:23:40.806 --> 00:23:42.116 A:middle
I'm just going to change my code

00:23:42.116 --> 00:23:45.666 A:middle
signing right here to use this

00:23:45.826 --> 00:23:47.246 A:middle
provisioning profile, which I

00:23:47.246 --> 00:23:48.816 A:middle
have previously downloaded, and

00:23:48.816 --> 00:23:50.736 A:middle
it has the magic entitlement in

00:23:51.176 --> 00:23:51.266 A:middle
it.

00:23:51.266 --> 00:23:54.216 A:middle
I can verify that touching the

00:23:54.216 --> 00:23:55.616 A:middle
info button right here, and

00:23:55.616 --> 00:23:57.106 A:middle
you'll see that the

00:23:57.106 --> 00:23:58.466 A:middle
com.apple.developer.

00:23:58.466 --> 00:24:00.606 A:middle
edu-assessment-mode entitlement

00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:01.216 A:middle
is buried in here.

00:24:01.216 --> 00:24:01.636 A:middle
We're good.

00:24:01.636 --> 00:24:03.326 A:middle
I can compile an app now that

00:24:03.326 --> 00:24:04.346 A:middle
will use this particular

00:24:04.346 --> 00:24:04.906 A:middle
entitlement.

00:24:05.756 --> 00:24:06.256 A:middle
That's step one.

00:24:06.776 --> 00:24:09.226 A:middle
Step two is that Xcode these

00:24:09.226 --> 00:24:11.866 A:middle
days is particularly cautious,

00:24:12.106 --> 00:24:14.576 A:middle
I'll say, and Xcode wants you to

00:24:14.576 --> 00:24:17.656 A:middle
state exactly which entitlement

00:24:17.656 --> 00:24:19.476 A:middle
this app needs to use right now

00:24:20.306 --> 00:24:21.446 A:middle
by creating an entitlements

00:24:21.446 --> 00:24:21.876 A:middle
file.

00:24:21.876 --> 00:24:23.366 A:middle
It's not enough just to have the

00:24:23.366 --> 00:24:24.796 A:middle
provisioning profile with the

00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:25.516 A:middle
entitlement in it.

00:24:25.756 --> 00:24:28.106 A:middle
You also need an actual

00:24:28.106 --> 00:24:29.096 A:middle
entitlements file.

00:24:29.306 --> 00:24:30.166 A:middle
I've made one of these here.

00:24:30.166 --> 00:24:32.356 A:middle
Entitlements files are just keys

00:24:32.356 --> 00:24:33.306 A:middle
and values like that.

00:24:34.136 --> 00:24:35.526 A:middle
So I'm going to add this.

00:24:35.556 --> 00:24:36.416 A:middle
This is the awkward part of the

00:24:36.416 --> 00:24:36.666 A:middle
demo.

00:24:36.666 --> 00:24:37.346 A:middle
I'm going to add this

00:24:37.346 --> 00:24:38.816 A:middle
entitlements file to my project,

00:24:39.246 --> 00:24:42.076 A:middle
and I'm going to go to the build

00:24:42.076 --> 00:24:43.346 A:middle
settings, my favorite part of

00:24:43.346 --> 00:24:44.446 A:middle
Xcode, looking around at the

00:24:44.446 --> 00:24:47.746 A:middle
build settings for the

00:24:47.996 --> 00:24:50.066 A:middle
entitlements, and I'm going to

00:24:50.066 --> 00:24:52.166 A:middle
tell it that I want to use that

00:24:52.166 --> 00:24:53.266 A:middle
file, AAC.entitlements.

00:24:54.676 --> 00:24:56.186 A:middle
I'm specifying that that's my

00:24:56.186 --> 00:24:57.546 A:middle
entitlements file specifying

00:24:57.546 --> 00:24:58.696 A:middle
that, yes, I really do want to

00:24:58.696 --> 00:25:02.316 A:middle
use education assessment.

00:25:02.696 --> 00:25:05.066 A:middle
All right.

00:25:05.276 --> 00:25:06.266 A:middle
Now I think we're okay to go.

00:25:06.266 --> 00:25:07.076 A:middle
Now I think we're okay to go.

00:25:07.076 --> 00:25:08.376 A:middle
This is still an insecure test,

00:25:08.376 --> 00:25:09.436 A:middle
because it's not making any

00:25:09.436 --> 00:25:10.836 A:middle
effort to call the locking

00:25:10.836 --> 00:25:11.786 A:middle
function, so I'm going to put

00:25:11.786 --> 00:25:11.996 A:middle
that in.

00:25:11.996 --> 00:25:14.056 A:middle
I'm going to put a lock around

00:25:14.056 --> 00:25:16.306 A:middle
this present line right here.

00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:19.366 A:middle
Here we go.

00:25:19.366 --> 00:25:21.206 A:middle
[inaudible] Apple we have these

00:25:21.416 --> 00:25:24.066 A:middle
little shortcuts ready to go.

00:25:24.066 --> 00:25:25.806 A:middle
This is the block of code that I

00:25:25.806 --> 00:25:26.456 A:middle
just pasted in.

00:25:26.456 --> 00:25:27.826 A:middle
We're going to request a Guided

00:25:27.826 --> 00:25:29.316 A:middle
Access session with the

00:25:29.316 --> 00:25:30.456 A:middle
parameter true.

00:25:30.636 --> 00:25:31.876 A:middle
True means lock, yes, now.

00:25:32.166 --> 00:25:33.626 A:middle
And if it succeeds, we're going

00:25:33.626 --> 00:25:34.166 A:middle
to do one thing.

00:25:34.356 --> 00:25:35.626 A:middle
If it fails, we're going to do

00:25:35.626 --> 00:25:36.366 A:middle
another thing.

00:25:36.756 --> 00:25:37.746 A:middle
So I'm going to move this line

00:25:37.746 --> 00:25:40.446 A:middle
of code up into that if block up

00:25:40.446 --> 00:25:40.626 A:middle
there.

00:25:42.456 --> 00:25:43.666 A:middle
By the way, if you take nothing

00:25:43.666 --> 00:25:44.626 A:middle
else home from this session,

00:25:45.146 --> 00:25:46.866 A:middle
command option left bracket

00:25:46.896 --> 00:25:48.376 A:middle
moves lines of code up, and

00:25:48.376 --> 00:25:49.606 A:middle
command option right bracket

00:25:49.606 --> 00:25:50.126 A:middle
moves them down.

00:25:50.126 --> 00:25:51.106 A:middle
This is the greatest thing.

00:25:51.946 --> 00:25:54.066 A:middle
Hey, oh, look at that fun.

00:25:54.806 --> 00:25:56.636 A:middle
Anyway, we is now put that

00:25:56.636 --> 00:25:57.696 A:middle
inside this if statement.

00:25:57.696 --> 00:25:58.746 A:middle
So we're going to request a

00:25:58.746 --> 00:26:00.156 A:middle
lock, and if it succeeded ,

00:26:00.156 --> 00:26:01.036 A:middle
we're going to present the other

00:26:01.036 --> 00:26:01.626 A:middle
view controller.

00:26:02.196 --> 00:26:04.866 A:middle
It's important to pair the locks

00:26:05.156 --> 00:26:06.166 A:middle
with the unlocks.

00:26:06.166 --> 00:26:07.416 A:middle
You have to have some way of

00:26:07.416 --> 00:26:08.896 A:middle
unlocking the application.

00:26:09.126 --> 00:26:10.526 A:middle
And in this particularly

00:26:10.686 --> 00:26:12.136 A:middle
extremely simple app , I'm just

00:26:12.466 --> 00:26:13.206 A:middle
going to do it here.

00:26:13.206 --> 00:26:14.686 A:middle
Every time this main test picker

00:26:14.686 --> 00:26:15.936 A:middle
view shows up on the screen,

00:26:15.936 --> 00:26:17.186 A:middle
we're going to unlock.

00:26:18.476 --> 00:26:20.896 A:middle
This is an unlock call to that

00:26:20.896 --> 00:26:21.266 A:middle
function.

00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:22.556 A:middle
We're passing it false to say

00:26:22.556 --> 00:26:24.406 A:middle
please try to unlock the device.

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:26.476 A:middle
So we lock the device when we

00:26:26.476 --> 00:26:27.806 A:middle
leave the test picker screen,

00:26:27.806 --> 00:26:28.666 A:middle
and we unlock it when we come

00:26:28.666 --> 00:26:29.866 A:middle
back to the test picker screen.

00:26:30.616 --> 00:26:31.676 A:middle
I think we're okay here.

00:26:32.626 --> 00:26:33.196 A:middle
Let's find out.

00:26:34.476 --> 00:26:40.906 A:middle
Try running this.

00:26:41.116 --> 00:26:43.526 A:middle
And here it is.

00:26:44.496 --> 00:26:46.226 A:middle
So I'm going to choose the

00:26:46.226 --> 00:26:47.406 A:middle
geography test, and I'm going to

00:26:47.406 --> 00:26:48.226 A:middle
touch Start Test.

00:26:48.226 --> 00:26:49.206 A:middle
That's when the lock code is

00:26:49.206 --> 00:26:49.546 A:middle
invoked.

00:26:49.546 --> 00:26:50.566 A:middle
I'll touch Start Test.

00:26:50.846 --> 00:26:51.706 A:middle
now it's asking me.

00:26:51.706 --> 00:26:53.286 A:middle
Now it's asking me the user to

00:26:53.286 --> 00:26:55.166 A:middle
confirm that we like to enter

00:26:55.466 --> 00:26:56.756 A:middle
single app mode for the duration

00:26:56.756 --> 00:26:57.986 A:middle
of eight hours or until the test

00:26:57.986 --> 00:26:58.966 A:middle
is over, and I'll say yes.

00:26:59.496 --> 00:27:02.936 A:middle
Now that I'm in the geography

00:27:02.936 --> 00:27:03.846 A:middle
test, you'll see the banner at

00:27:03.846 --> 00:27:05.076 A:middle
the top advising me that would

00:27:05.076 --> 00:27:06.446 A:middle
like for the next eight hours or

00:27:06.446 --> 00:27:07.306 A:middle
until the test is over.

00:27:07.306 --> 00:27:09.056 A:middle
I can't look anything up here

00:27:09.056 --> 00:27:09.566 A:middle
anymore.

00:27:09.566 --> 00:27:11.736 A:middle
That had the look up button on

00:27:11.736 --> 00:27:12.446 A:middle
it before.

00:27:12.446 --> 00:27:12.946 A:middle
I could have looked up the

00:27:12.946 --> 00:27:14.096 A:middle
answer in Wikipedia, but that's

00:27:14.096 --> 00:27:15.806 A:middle
been automatically turned off.

00:27:16.816 --> 00:27:18.686 A:middle
My spell checking has been

00:27:18.686 --> 00:27:21.066 A:middle
automatically turned off down

00:27:21.066 --> 00:27:21.436 A:middle
here.

00:27:21.436 --> 00:27:23.346 A:middle
we're really taking all the fun

00:27:23.346 --> 00:27:24.756 A:middle
things out of the iPad here for

00:27:24.756 --> 00:27:25.816 A:middle
the duration of this test here,

00:27:25.816 --> 00:27:26.626 A:middle
just to ensure that we have a

00:27:26.626 --> 00:27:27.646 A:middle
test with some integrity here.

00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:28.966 A:middle
The capital of Canada is Ottawa.

00:27:28.966 --> 00:27:32.656 A:middle
Alright. And when I touch the

00:27:32.656 --> 00:27:33.946 A:middle
Submit button, we return to this

00:27:33.946 --> 00:27:36.496 A:middle

00:27:36.736 --> 00:27:37.476 A:middle
with the other function I put

00:27:37.476 --> 00:27:37.556 A:middle
in.

00:27:37.556 --> 00:27:38.896 A:middle
now the Home button is now

00:27:39.186 --> 00:27:39.516 A:middle
working.

00:27:39.646 --> 00:27:41.226 A:middle
So the Home button was not

00:27:41.226 --> 00:27:42.006 A:middle
working while we were in the

00:27:42.006 --> 00:27:42.456 A:middle
test.

00:27:42.866 --> 00:27:44.376 A:middle
All those cheating services were

00:27:44.376 --> 00:27:46.496 A:middle
not working either, and once we

00:27:46.496 --> 00:27:47.826 A:middle
exited the test, everything was

00:27:47.826 --> 00:27:48.006 A:middle
fine.

00:27:48.006 --> 00:27:48.926 A:middle
I'm feeling kind of confident

here.

00:27:49.026 --> 00:27:49.796 A:middle
I want to try another test.

00:27:49.796 --> 00:27:50.586 A:middle

00:27:54.616 --> 00:27:55.606 A:middle

00:27:57.116 --> 00:27:59.256 A:middle

00:29:40.236 --> 00:29:41.376 A:middle
to actually add this to your

00:29:41.376 --> 00:29:43.566 A:middle

00:29:43.566 --> 00:29:44.096 A:middle

00:29:44.096 --> 00:29:44.666 A:middle
I've got to remind you.

00:29:44.666 --> 00:29:45.226 A:middle
You've got to get that

00:29:45.226 --> 00:29:46.836 A:middle

Let's talk about a couple of

00:29:51.636 --> 00:29:52.626 A:middle
other considerations.

00:29:53.086 --> 00:29:54.776 A:middle
I've mentioned that the request

00:29:54.906 --> 00:29:57.806 A:middle
to lock might fail, and that's

00:29:57.806 --> 00:29:59.166 A:middle
true in the ASAM model where

00:29:59.166 --> 00:30:00.186 A:middle
you're deploying to a supervised

00:30:00.186 --> 00:30:02.246 A:middle
device and also the AAC model

00:30:02.246 --> 00:30:03.196 A:middle
where you're deploying to any

00:30:03.196 --> 00:30:05.026 A:middle
device with the entitlement.

00:30:05.026 --> 00:30:06.416 A:middle
The request to lock can fail, so

00:30:06.416 --> 00:30:07.626 A:middle
you really do need to check that

00:30:07.626 --> 00:30:07.916 A:middle
parameter.

00:30:08.576 --> 00:30:10.216 A:middle
In ASAM, it will fail if the

00:30:10.216 --> 00:30:12.356 A:middle
device is not supervised and if

00:30:12.356 --> 00:30:13.506 A:middle
the bundle identifier hasn't

00:30:13.506 --> 00:30:14.556 A:middle
been set up properly.

00:30:14.556 --> 00:30:15.836 A:middle
In other words, if the device is

00:30:15.836 --> 00:30:17.246 A:middle
not being managed properly for

00:30:17.246 --> 00:30:18.966 A:middle

00:30:20.196 --> 00:30:20.776 A:middle
fail.

00:30:20.866 --> 00:30:24.096 A:middle
In AAC, it will fail if your app

00:30:24.096 --> 00:30:25.406 A:middle
does not have this entitlement

00:30:25.766 --> 00:30:26.286 A:middle
built in.

00:30:27.576 --> 00:30:29.176 A:middle
In both cases, it will fail if

00:30:29.176 --> 00:30:31.126 A:middle
the user hit "no" on that button

00:30:31.126 --> 00:30:32.026 A:middle
where -- that panel where

00:30:32.026 --> 00:30:32.936 A:middle
they're asked if they want to

00:30:32.936 --> 00:30:33.516 A:middle
lock or not.

00:30:34.426 --> 00:30:35.386 A:middle
But, and this is kind of weird,

00:30:35.386 --> 00:30:36.896 A:middle
it will fail if the device is

00:30:36.896 --> 00:30:37.596 A:middle
already locked.

00:30:37.596 --> 00:30:39.976 A:middle
This is a little weird.

00:30:40.756 --> 00:30:41.886 A:middle
If you make the lock request

00:30:41.886 --> 00:30:43.196 A:middle
twice in a row, the first one

00:30:43.196 --> 00:30:43.896 A:middle
will succeed.

00:30:44.076 --> 00:30:44.636 A:middle
You'll be locked.

00:30:44.636 --> 00:30:45.976 A:middle
If you ask to lock again, the

00:30:45.976 --> 00:30:47.736 A:middle
second one will fail, but you'll

00:30:47.736 --> 00:30:48.526 A:middle
still be locked.

00:30:49.606 --> 00:30:51.486 A:middle
So you have to be careful about

00:30:51.486 --> 00:30:52.866 A:middle
this in the setup of an

00:30:52.866 --> 00:30:54.236 A:middle
assessment application.

00:30:54.516 --> 00:30:55.866 A:middle
All those restrictions of

00:30:55.866 --> 00:30:56.986 A:middle
disabling the dictionary and

00:30:56.986 --> 00:30:58.796 A:middle
spell checking, those are only

00:30:58.796 --> 00:31:00.546 A:middle
there if it was your app that

00:31:00.546 --> 00:31:02.216 A:middle
actually successfully called

00:31:02.786 --> 00:31:03.076 A:middle
that

00:31:03.076 --> 00:31:05.046 A:middle
UIRequestGuidedAccessSession

00:31:05.746 --> 00:31:06.146 A:middle
function.

00:31:06.816 --> 00:31:07.716 A:middle
If you were locked for some

00:31:07.716 --> 00:31:09.976 A:middle
other reason, those restrictions

00:31:09.976 --> 00:31:11.966 A:middle
are not going to be in place.

00:31:12.436 --> 00:31:14.066 A:middle
So it is a good practice to

00:31:14.066 --> 00:31:14.546 A:middle
check.

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:15.716 A:middle
Before you try to lock the

00:31:15.716 --> 00:31:16.936 A:middle
device, check if it's already

00:31:16.936 --> 00:31:17.296 A:middle
locked.

00:31:18.166 --> 00:31:19.456 A:middle
Because if it already is locked,

00:31:19.826 --> 00:31:22.336 A:middle
and you didn't do it, something

00:31:22.336 --> 00:31:22.956 A:middle
is wrong.

00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:24.976 A:middle
We're in an odd situation.

00:31:24.976 --> 00:31:26.066 A:middle
Maybe somebody walked up and

00:31:26.066 --> 00:31:27.376 A:middle
turned on Guided Access with the

00:31:27.376 --> 00:31:28.166 A:middle
triple tap thing.

00:31:28.456 --> 00:31:29.646 A:middle
If they did that, the

00:31:29.646 --> 00:31:31.266 A:middle
restrictions are not going to be

00:31:31.886 --> 00:31:32.696 A:middle
disabled properly.

00:31:33.216 --> 00:31:34.226 A:middle
So it's important that you

00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:35.176 A:middle
actually check.

00:31:35.476 --> 00:31:36.056 A:middle
Here's one way.

00:31:36.326 --> 00:31:37.586 A:middle
You can check when the app is

00:31:37.626 --> 00:31:38.116 A:middle
launched.

00:31:38.766 --> 00:31:40.486 A:middle
We suggest you wait for two

00:31:40.486 --> 00:31:41.286 A:middle
seconds after app launch,

00:31:41.286 --> 00:31:42.326 A:middle
because it takes a moment to

00:31:42.326 --> 00:31:43.886 A:middle
lock everything, but you can

00:31:43.886 --> 00:31:45.436 A:middle
check after app launch, call

00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:46.746 A:middle
that Is GuidedAccessEnabled

00:31:46.746 --> 00:31:47.166 A:middle
function.

00:31:47.386 --> 00:31:48.466 A:middle
And if you are locked

00:31:48.656 --> 00:31:49.776 A:middle
immediately after launch,

00:31:50.526 --> 00:31:51.536 A:middle
something is wrong in your

00:31:51.536 --> 00:31:52.296 A:middle
testing environment.

00:31:52.296 --> 00:31:52.966 A:middle
You weren't supposed to be

00:31:52.966 --> 00:31:53.706 A:middle
locked at this point.

00:31:54.086 --> 00:31:56.036 A:middle
For a test, you should stop at

00:31:56.036 --> 00:31:56.416 A:middle
that point.

00:31:56.416 --> 00:31:57.476 A:middle
You should not proceed with the

00:31:58.556 --> 00:31:58.886 A:middle
test.

00:31:58.886 --> 00:32:01.226 A:middle
Similarly, you should do a test

00:32:01.226 --> 00:32:02.816 A:middle
before attempting to call the

00:32:02.816 --> 00:32:04.076 A:middle
lock function.

00:32:04.076 --> 00:32:05.626 A:middle
You should check that Guided

00:32:05.626 --> 00:32:06.656 A:middle
Access is false,

00:32:06.656 --> 00:32:08.006 A:middle
GuidedAccessEnabled is false

00:32:08.006 --> 00:32:08.906 A:middle
before you try to lock.

00:32:08.906 --> 00:32:10.536 A:middle
You want to make sure you're in

00:32:10.536 --> 00:32:12.706 A:middle
the right state before you call

00:32:12.706 --> 00:32:13.566 A:middle
the locking the function to

00:32:13.566 --> 00:32:14.366 A:middle
ensure that not only is the

00:32:14.366 --> 00:32:16.036 A:middle
device locked, but it's locked

00:32:16.306 --> 00:32:17.126 A:middle
with the restrictions.

00:32:17.126 --> 00:32:20.266 A:middle
Here's another consideration for

00:32:20.266 --> 00:32:21.726 A:middle
a standardized test.

00:32:21.726 --> 00:32:22.856 A:middle
Probably a good idea to clear

00:32:22.856 --> 00:32:24.526 A:middle
the paste board coming in and

00:32:24.526 --> 00:32:25.396 A:middle
leaving your test.

00:32:26.036 --> 00:32:28.066 A:middle
AAC automatically disables the

00:32:28.066 --> 00:32:29.746 A:middle
universal clipboard for sharing

00:32:29.746 --> 00:32:31.566 A:middle
to other devices, but you need

00:32:31.566 --> 00:32:33.666 A:middle
to clear the built-in system

00:32:33.666 --> 00:32:35.026 A:middle
paste board when the test starts

00:32:35.026 --> 00:32:36.726 A:middle
to keep a child from copying the

00:32:36.726 --> 00:32:38.156 A:middle
test in notes and then launching

00:32:38.156 --> 00:32:38.426 A:middle
the app.

00:32:38.426 --> 00:32:39.226 A:middle
You want to clear that out.

00:32:39.226 --> 00:32:40.206 A:middle
You probably want to clear it on

00:32:40.206 --> 00:32:41.996 A:middle
exit of the test as well, so

00:32:41.996 --> 00:32:43.206 A:middle
they don't copy the questions

00:32:43.206 --> 00:32:44.156 A:middle
and see it somewhere else.

00:32:44.616 --> 00:32:45.426 A:middle
Pretty straightforward to do

00:32:45.426 --> 00:32:45.596 A:middle
that.

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:47.386 A:middle
You just set the items of the

00:32:47.386 --> 00:32:48.496 A:middle
general paste board to an empty

00:32:48.496 --> 00:32:48.766 A:middle
array.

00:32:50.096 --> 00:32:51.646 A:middle
You should probably consider

00:32:51.646 --> 00:32:53.446 A:middle
disabling third party keyboards

00:32:53.446 --> 00:32:55.596 A:middle
in an assessment app as well.

00:32:56.546 --> 00:32:57.796 A:middle
Third party keyboards are app

00:32:57.796 --> 00:32:59.006 A:middle
extensions, and they're not

00:32:59.006 --> 00:32:59.986 A:middle
blocked by AAC.

00:32:59.986 --> 00:33:03.126 A:middle
You might have an application

00:33:03.446 --> 00:33:04.606 A:middle
like this, where the student has

00:33:04.606 --> 00:33:07.356 A:middle
installed another keyboard which

00:33:07.356 --> 00:33:08.616 A:middle
actually some keyboards actually

00:33:08.616 --> 00:33:09.996 A:middle
support searching right in the

00:33:09.996 --> 00:33:10.506 A:middle
keyboard.

00:33:10.506 --> 00:33:11.646 A:middle
You could search for the capital

00:33:11.646 --> 00:33:12.406 A:middle
of Canada right there in the

00:33:12.406 --> 00:33:13.756 A:middle
keyboard and get the answer.

00:33:13.996 --> 00:33:15.096 A:middle
That's probably not a good

00:33:15.096 --> 00:33:17.166 A:middle
keyboard to use in a test.

00:33:17.806 --> 00:33:19.096 A:middle
So as a developer of an

00:33:19.096 --> 00:33:20.316 A:middle
assessment application, you can

00:33:20.316 --> 00:33:21.666 A:middle
implement this function in your

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:23.606 A:middle
application delegate to allow or

00:33:23.606 --> 00:33:25.696 A:middle
disallow specific types of

00:33:25.696 --> 00:33:26.996 A:middle
extensions as they are being

00:33:26.996 --> 00:33:27.346 A:middle
voted.

00:33:27.666 --> 00:33:28.896 A:middle
I would suggest just disallowing

00:33:29.136 --> 00:33:30.256 A:middle
all of them, especially

00:33:30.256 --> 00:33:30.796 A:middle
keyboards.

00:33:31.166 --> 00:33:32.496 A:middle
But disallow all extensions in a

00:33:32.496 --> 00:33:33.356 A:middle
standardized test app.

00:33:33.356 --> 00:33:34.306 A:middle
Remember, the goal is to take

00:33:34.306 --> 00:33:35.816 A:middle
all the fun out of the iPad for

00:33:35.886 --> 00:33:36.846 A:middle
the duration of the test, and

00:33:36.846 --> 00:33:38.456 A:middle
then restore the fun when we're

00:33:38.456 --> 00:33:38.736 A:middle
done.

00:33:39.136 --> 00:33:41.266 A:middle
Let me just review again the

00:33:41.266 --> 00:33:42.216 A:middle
difference between these two

00:33:42.216 --> 00:33:43.416 A:middle
techniques, because in software,

00:33:43.416 --> 00:33:44.416 A:middle
they're exactly the same.

00:33:44.846 --> 00:33:46.516 A:middle
You call this same function,

00:33:47.386 --> 00:33:48.626 A:middle
UIAccessibilityRequest

00:33:48.626 --> 00:33:50.186 A:middle
GuidedAccessSession, and the

00:33:50.186 --> 00:33:51.796 A:middle
effect is different, depending

00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:54.746 A:middle
on how the devices and your app

00:33:54.746 --> 00:33:56.166 A:middle
are set up.

00:33:57.016 --> 00:33:58.066 A:middle
The code is the same.

00:33:58.386 --> 00:33:59.156 A:middle
You call that function.

00:33:59.156 --> 00:34:00.966 A:middle
In each scenario, the device is

00:34:00.966 --> 00:34:01.256 A:middle
locked.

00:34:01.746 --> 00:34:03.196 A:middle
Remember though that in ASAM we

00:34:03.196 --> 00:34:04.096 A:middle
have to be dealing with a

00:34:04.096 --> 00:34:05.646 A:middle
managed and supervised device.

00:34:05.996 --> 00:34:07.626 A:middle
In AAC, we can deal with any

00:34:07.626 --> 00:34:09.006 A:middle
device, so long as your app has

00:34:09.006 --> 00:34:09.526 A:middle
the entitlement.

00:34:10.736 --> 00:34:12.106 A:middle
But the biggest difference is

00:34:12.106 --> 00:34:13.426 A:middle
that AAC also turns off a whole

00:34:13.426 --> 00:34:14.606 A:middle
bunch of other stuff for the

00:34:14.606 --> 00:34:16.006 A:middle
duration of the locking session.

00:34:16.006 --> 00:34:17.356 A:middle
So that is the technology you

00:34:17.356 --> 00:34:18.696 A:middle
want to use if you're an

00:34:18.696 --> 00:34:20.666 A:middle
assessment developer, to lock an

00:34:20.666 --> 00:34:21.146 A:middle
application.

00:34:21.386 --> 00:34:22.576 A:middle
Other developers may find that

00:34:22.576 --> 00:34:24.216 A:middle
ASAM meets their needs, but AAC

00:34:24.266 --> 00:34:27.076 A:middle
is specifically for assessment

00:34:27.076 --> 00:34:27.526 A:middle
developers.

00:34:27.676 --> 00:34:30.486 A:middle
So we talked about four ways to

00:34:30.486 --> 00:34:31.116 A:middle
lock an app.

00:34:31.256 --> 00:34:32.496 A:middle
Guided Access, lots of fun.

00:34:32.646 --> 00:34:33.516 A:middle
Do that when you get home.

00:34:33.906 --> 00:34:35.296 A:middle
Lock your children into the

00:34:35.296 --> 00:34:36.726 A:middle
SpongeBob Squarepants

00:34:36.726 --> 00:34:37.876 A:middle
application so that they can't

00:34:37.876 --> 00:34:39.496 A:middle
look at your mail, and then

00:34:39.496 --> 00:34:41.106 A:middle
that's a nice easy end user sort

00:34:41.106 --> 00:34:41.556 A:middle
of thing to do.

00:34:41.776 --> 00:34:42.976 A:middle
Works on any device with any

00:34:42.976 --> 00:34:43.366 A:middle
app.

00:34:43.996 --> 00:34:45.126 A:middle
Single app mode is good for

00:34:45.126 --> 00:34:46.376 A:middle
kiosks, but it requires the

00:34:46.376 --> 00:34:47.476 A:middle
administrator to push out a

00:34:47.476 --> 00:34:49.546 A:middle
command to a fleet of managed

00:34:49.546 --> 00:34:50.766 A:middle
supervised devices, and then

00:34:50.766 --> 00:34:51.906 A:middle
they are pretty much permanently

00:34:51.906 --> 00:34:53.966 A:middle
locked to the application.

00:34:54.256 --> 00:34:58.226 A:middle
And then ASAM and AAC are the

00:34:58.226 --> 00:34:59.786 A:middle
same software function with two

00:34:59.786 --> 00:35:00.846 A:middle
different effects, depending on

00:35:00.846 --> 00:35:01.306 A:middle
the setup.

00:35:02.186 --> 00:35:03.426 A:middle
Two different effects depending

00:35:03.426 --> 00:35:04.486 A:middle
on whether your app has this

00:35:04.486 --> 00:35:05.826 A:middle
entitlement and whether the

00:35:05.826 --> 00:35:07.426 A:middle
devices are managed or not.

00:35:09.216 --> 00:35:10.846 A:middle
So there's a bunch of related

00:35:10.846 --> 00:35:12.236 A:middle
sessions at the conference.

00:35:12.236 --> 00:35:13.386 A:middle
I hope you enjoyed all the

00:35:13.386 --> 00:35:14.376 A:middle
related sessions.

00:35:14.376 --> 00:35:15.666 A:middle
I like that second one on

00:35:15.816 --> 00:35:16.886 A:middle
heifers and HVAC.

00:35:16.886 --> 00:35:17.696 A:middle
I think that's the air

00:35:17.696 --> 00:35:18.726 A:middle
conditioning for cows.

00:35:18.726 --> 00:35:19.576 A:middle
Oh, I'm reading that wrong.

00:35:20.086 --> 00:35:21.056 A:middle
HEIF and HEVC.

00:35:21.056 --> 00:35:21.956 A:middle
A lot of our assessment

00:35:21.956 --> 00:35:23.486 A:middle
developers deliver web content

00:35:23.726 --> 00:35:24.806 A:middle
as part of their applications,

00:35:24.806 --> 00:35:25.306 A:middle
so I think these are

00:35:25.306 --> 00:35:27.026 A:middle
particularly relevant sessions

00:35:27.026 --> 00:35:27.696 A:middle
for people to use.

00:35:28.106 --> 00:35:29.486 A:middle
But for more information and for

00:35:29.486 --> 00:35:30.566 A:middle
-- including a sample

00:35:30.566 --> 00:35:31.606 A:middle
application that demonstrates

00:35:31.606 --> 00:35:33.546 A:middle
how all this works, please take

00:35:33.546 --> 00:35:34.416 A:middle
a look at the website here for

00:35:34.416 --> 00:35:36.216 A:middle
Session 760.

00:35:37.296 --> 00:35:37.856 A:middle
Thank you very much.

00:35:37.856 --> 00:35:38.446 A:middle
Thank you for coming.

00:35:38.446 --> 00:35:39.986 A:middle
I hope you enjoy the week.

00:35:39.986 --> 00:35:40.053 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:35:40.053 --> 00:35:40.216 A:middle
Thank you.
