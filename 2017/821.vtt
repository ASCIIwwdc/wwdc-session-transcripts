00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:22.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:23.826 A:middle
Today we're going to talk about

00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:25.336 A:middle
something very colorful.

00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:29.846 A:middle
Display P3 and Wide Gamut, what

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:31.736 A:middle
that is and how we use it.

00:00:32.316 --> 00:00:34.476 A:middle
But first I want to mention

00:00:34.476 --> 00:00:35.746 A:middle
color management real quick.

00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:37.956 A:middle
With color management we make

00:00:37.956 --> 00:00:39.416 A:middle
sure that the display colors as

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.526 A:middle
accurately as possible across

00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:44.206 A:middle
devices, platforms, and color

00:00:44.206 --> 00:00:44.796 A:middle
spaces.

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:47.116 A:middle
And color management is built

00:00:47.226 --> 00:00:50.176 A:middle
into both Mac OS and iOS.

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:53.606 A:middle
And color management helps avoid

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:55.286 A:middle
a situation like this where

00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:56.706 A:middle
colors are incorrectly

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:59.966 A:middle
represented going from source to

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:00.526 A:middle
device.

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:03.736 A:middle
So as a designer makes sure to

00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:05.906 A:middle
tag your assets properly to

00:01:05.906 --> 00:01:07.686 A:middle
allow for color management to

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:09.496 A:middle
accurately display your colors.

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:13.596 A:middle
So what is then Display P3?

00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:15.646 A:middle
Very simply put it's a color

00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:17.846 A:middle
space within the RGB color model

00:01:18.106 --> 00:01:19.336 A:middle
that represents a larger

00:01:19.336 --> 00:01:20.966 A:middle
spectrum of colors than the

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:24.166 A:middle
current industry standard sRGB.

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.496 A:middle
And most of us have been using

00:01:25.816 --> 00:01:27.496 A:middle
sRGB for probably over a decade

00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:31.156 A:middle
now, but with display P3 we get

00:01:31.546 --> 00:01:34.016 A:middle
a 25 percent larger color space

00:01:34.346 --> 00:01:35.166 A:middle
compared to sRGB.

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.656 A:middle
This means that they can

00:01:36.656 --> 00:01:38.656 A:middle
represent more colors with

00:01:38.656 --> 00:01:40.076 A:middle
better accuracy and stay more

00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:41.456 A:middle
true to what those colors

00:01:41.786 --> 00:01:43.536 A:middle
actually look like in real life.

00:01:44.306 --> 00:01:45.976 A:middle
And in this image the black

00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:47.586 A:middle
strobe represents the size of

00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:49.956 A:middle
the sRGB color space and as you

00:01:49.956 --> 00:01:52.486 A:middle
can see the Display P3 extends

00:01:52.656 --> 00:01:55.166 A:middle
way beyond that.

00:01:55.526 --> 00:01:56.756 A:middle
And when the color space is

00:01:56.936 --> 00:01:58.456 A:middle
larger than sRGB it is

00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:00.696 A:middle
informally referred to as a wide

00:02:00.696 --> 00:02:03.546 A:middle
gamut color space, also displays

00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:05.136 A:middle
supporting a larger color space

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:07.476 A:middle
than sRGB referred to as wide

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:08.426 A:middle
gamut displays.

00:02:08.546 --> 00:02:11.306 A:middle
And the late 2015 iMac Retina

00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:13.116 A:middle
was the first consumer-facing

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:15.586 A:middle
computer that supported Display

00:02:16.746 --> 00:02:16.813 A:middle
P3.

00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:19.506 A:middle
When working with the Display P3

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:21.146 A:middle
color profile you have the

00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:22.616 A:middle
opportunity to also use a larger

00:02:22.616 --> 00:02:23.416 A:middle
color depth.

00:02:23.796 --> 00:02:25.586 A:middle
16 bit per channel instead of

00:02:25.586 --> 00:02:26.286 A:middle
the usual 8.

00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:28.616 A:middle
That allows you to represent

00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:29.926 A:middle
more colors within the wide

00:02:29.986 --> 00:02:32.676 A:middle
gamut, which is especially

00:02:32.676 --> 00:02:34.166 A:middle
useful for gradients.

00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:35.596 A:middle
So let's take a look at an

00:02:35.596 --> 00:02:37.886 A:middle
example of that.

00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:39.026 A:middle
Now this is a somewhat

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:40.756 A:middle
exaggerated example, but clearly

00:02:40.756 --> 00:02:42.386 A:middle
we have banding happening in

00:02:42.906 --> 00:02:44.186 A:middle
this sRGB gradient.

00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:46.016 A:middle
Something i could try to get run

00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:47.006 A:middle
by using dithering.

00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:49.076 A:middle
And it will look something like

00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:49.426 A:middle
this.

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:52.686 A:middle
Or if I instead use Display

00:02:52.686 --> 00:02:55.076 A:middle
P3and set my color depth to 16

00:02:55.076 --> 00:02:56.786 A:middle
bits per channel, then banding

00:02:56.786 --> 00:02:58.756 A:middle
is then much less visible.

00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:01.266 A:middle
We're simply closing the gap

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:03.346 A:middle
between each defined color,

00:03:03.626 --> 00:03:05.646 A:middle
giving us a much better result.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.696 A:middle
And we chose to display P3 for

00:03:09.696 --> 00:03:11.396 A:middle
its similarities to our existing

00:03:11.396 --> 00:03:12.576 A:middle
view and conditions that were

00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:14.956 A:middle
already defined in sRGB.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.346 A:middle
Then by lining both the gamut

00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:19.016 A:middle
and the wide points, we get a

00:03:19.016 --> 00:03:20.486 A:middle
color space that behaves very

00:03:20.486 --> 00:03:22.986 A:middle
similar, making the threshold to

00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:24.666 A:middle
understand again working with

00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:26.496 A:middle
Display P3 much lower.

00:03:28.496 --> 00:03:30.006 A:middle
But before we move on I want to

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:31.186 A:middle
mention that since we're looking

00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:33.126 A:middle
at this presentation on sRGB

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:35.246 A:middle
based projection system, all of

00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:36.286 A:middle
the examples in this

00:03:36.286 --> 00:03:37.996 A:middle
presentation are renditions,

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:41.276 A:middle
which then leads me to who can

00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:43.386 A:middle
actually see Display P3 Images?

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:48.106 A:middle
Well users needs a wide gamut

00:03:48.106 --> 00:03:49.666 A:middle
display that supports the

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:51.736 A:middle
Display P3 color space and color

00:03:51.776 --> 00:03:52.496 A:middle
profile.

00:03:52.786 --> 00:03:54.056 A:middle
And Apple has supported wide

00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:55.716 A:middle
gamut displays since the late

00:03:55.716 --> 00:03:57.276 A:middle
2015 iMac Retina.

00:03:57.826 --> 00:03:59.336 A:middle
But now there's a wider range of

00:03:59.336 --> 00:04:01.746 A:middle
devices that all support Display

00:04:02.226 --> 00:04:03.676 A:middle
P3 -- for example, the iPhone 7,

00:04:04.346 --> 00:04:05.946 A:middle
the MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar

00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:07.926 A:middle
and also the iPad Pro.

00:04:08.776 --> 00:04:10.766 A:middle
But what about you as a

00:04:10.766 --> 00:04:11.316 A:middle
designer?

00:04:12.416 --> 00:04:13.646 A:middle
Because you do not want to be

00:04:13.646 --> 00:04:15.666 A:middle
flying blind when creating

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:16.856 A:middle
Display P3 assets.

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.826 A:middle
You want full control over your

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:19.336 A:middle
colors.

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:22.246 A:middle
So make sure to work on a wide

00:04:22.246 --> 00:04:24.316 A:middle
gamut display that supports

00:04:24.316 --> 00:04:26.166 A:middle
Display P3 like the MacBook Pro

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:27.426 A:middle
of the Touch Bar, the iMac

00:04:27.426 --> 00:04:30.646 A:middle
Retina, or the LG5K Display.

00:04:32.586 --> 00:04:34.596 A:middle
So now we know what display P3

00:04:34.596 --> 00:04:36.116 A:middle
is and how we can see it.

00:04:36.116 --> 00:04:37.486 A:middle
Let's take a look at an example.

00:04:38.886 --> 00:04:40.216 A:middle
In this beautiful image we have

00:04:40.216 --> 00:04:41.326 A:middle
some really nice colors.

00:04:41.426 --> 00:04:43.136 A:middle
Some with wide ranges of red,

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.356 A:middle
green, and orange.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.676 A:middle
Now this is an sRGB image to

00:04:46.676 --> 00:04:47.386 A:middle
current standard.

00:04:48.446 --> 00:04:50.306 A:middle
But because of the limitations

00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:52.976 A:middle
within sRGB, not all colors that

00:04:52.976 --> 00:04:54.726 A:middle
were captured by the camera are

00:04:54.726 --> 00:04:55.626 A:middle
in this photo.

00:04:56.276 --> 00:04:57.766 A:middle
Represented here by these light

00:04:57.766 --> 00:04:58.246 A:middle
blue fields.

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:00.706 A:middle
Simply because these colors were

00:05:00.706 --> 00:05:02.886 A:middle
not available in the sRGB color

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:03.446 A:middle
space.

00:05:04.586 --> 00:05:06.656 A:middle
The display P3 version of the

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:08.516 A:middle
same image is a completely

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:09.236 A:middle
different story.

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:12.236 A:middle
Now we have rich, beautiful, and

00:05:12.236 --> 00:05:13.536 A:middle
bold colors throughout the

00:05:13.536 --> 00:05:14.646 A:middle
entire image.

00:05:16.236 --> 00:05:17.456 A:middle
And if you compare the three

00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:18.956 A:middle
images we have a pretty

00:05:18.956 --> 00:05:20.736 A:middle
significant difference and I

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:22.436 A:middle
almost feel a little bit sad for

00:05:22.436 --> 00:05:23.466 A:middle
out buddy here on the left.

00:05:23.466 --> 00:05:25.316 A:middle
He looks really bad right now.

00:05:25.916 --> 00:05:29.736 A:middle
OK, so let's take a look at the

00:05:29.736 --> 00:05:31.246 A:middle
Display P3 Workflow and we're

00:05:31.246 --> 00:05:32.356 A:middle
going to be using Photoshop.

00:05:33.726 --> 00:05:35.266 A:middle
And let's begin with a brand new

00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:37.306 A:middle
document, and in order to take

00:05:37.306 --> 00:05:38.376 A:middle
full advantage of all of the

00:05:38.376 --> 00:05:40.636 A:middle
colors available in the Display

00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:42.346 A:middle
P3 Color Space, the first thing

00:05:42.346 --> 00:05:44.136 A:middle
you need to do is to tag your

00:05:44.136 --> 00:05:45.666 A:middle
asset with the correct color

00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:46.386 A:middle
profile.

00:05:47.116 --> 00:05:48.386 A:middle
So I'm creating that new

00:05:48.386 --> 00:05:50.246 A:middle
document in Photoshop, make sure

00:05:50.246 --> 00:05:51.496 A:middle
to set your color profile to

00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:53.436 A:middle
Display P3 like this.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:57.096 A:middle
And the next thing I want to do

00:05:57.096 --> 00:05:58.616 A:middle
is to change the color depth

00:05:59.906 --> 00:06:02.306 A:middle
from 8 to 16 bits per channel

00:06:03.406 --> 00:06:05.916 A:middle
like this.

00:06:06.456 --> 00:06:07.586 A:middle
And once you're finished with

00:06:07.586 --> 00:06:09.266 A:middle
you're absolutely fantastic

00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:11.296 A:middle
design, it is now time to save

00:06:11.296 --> 00:06:12.186 A:middle
out your artwork.

00:06:12.496 --> 00:06:13.796 A:middle
And there are multiple ways of

00:06:13.796 --> 00:06:15.766 A:middle
doing so on Photoshop like using

00:06:15.766 --> 00:06:18.396 A:middle
Generator or Export As.

00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:21.546 A:middle
But in this case it is key then

00:06:21.546 --> 00:06:23.846 A:middle
to use Save As and PNG as your

00:06:23.996 --> 00:06:26.366 A:middle
format because this is the only

00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:28.066 A:middle
way at the moment to both imbed

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:30.116 A:middle
a color profile and maintain the

00:06:30.116 --> 00:06:33.666 A:middle
color depth without -- in the

00:06:33.666 --> 00:06:34.386 A:middle
exported asset.

00:06:35.296 --> 00:06:37.716 A:middle
For example, Generator will not

00:06:37.716 --> 00:06:39.046 A:middle
imbed a color profile and leave

00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:40.806 A:middle
your asset entirely untagged.

00:06:41.246 --> 00:06:45.286 A:middle
So only use Save As.

00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:47.106 A:middle
When opening raw files in

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:49.396 A:middle
Photoshop, make sure to tag --

00:06:49.396 --> 00:06:51.126 A:middle
to change the color profile to

00:06:51.256 --> 00:06:53.286 A:middle
display P3 and the color depth

00:06:53.286 --> 00:06:55.096 A:middle
to 16 bits per channel by

00:06:55.096 --> 00:06:57.396 A:middle
clicking here.

00:06:58.416 --> 00:06:59.826 A:middle
Also, if you're receiving assets

00:06:59.826 --> 00:07:01.196 A:middle
from someone else, makes sure

00:07:01.196 --> 00:07:02.606 A:middle
that those assets are converted

00:07:02.606 --> 00:07:04.796 A:middle
to display P3 directly from the

00:07:04.796 --> 00:07:07.576 A:middle
raw file and not sRGB as the

00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:08.866 A:middle
color information would then

00:07:08.926 --> 00:07:10.496 A:middle
already be completely lost.

00:07:11.156 --> 00:07:12.926 A:middle
So walk down your asset pipeline

00:07:12.996 --> 00:07:14.836 A:middle
and make sure you get Display P3

00:07:14.836 --> 00:07:16.836 A:middle
assets directly from your

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:17.366 A:middle
source.

00:07:18.806 --> 00:07:20.476 A:middle
If you're working from an

00:07:20.476 --> 00:07:22.396 A:middle
existing asset like an app icon,

00:07:23.786 --> 00:07:25.946 A:middle
make sure to use Convert to

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:26.686 A:middle
Profile.

00:07:26.996 --> 00:07:28.046 A:middle
This will actually perform a

00:07:28.046 --> 00:07:29.776 A:middle
color match operation and not

00:07:29.826 --> 00:07:30.776 A:middle
alter your design.

00:07:33.376 --> 00:07:33.946 A:middle
Click like that.

00:07:34.726 --> 00:07:37.326 A:middle
And do not use Assign to Profile

00:07:37.326 --> 00:07:38.776 A:middle
as that will take your existing

00:07:38.776 --> 00:07:40.336 A:middle
colors and stretch those out

00:07:40.336 --> 00:07:41.746 A:middle
into the new color space

00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:43.886 A:middle
changing your design in some

00:07:43.886 --> 00:07:44.126 A:middle
way.

00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:46.866 A:middle
So always use Convert to

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:47.286 A:middle
profile.

00:07:48.476 --> 00:07:50.196 A:middle
As an example let's look what

00:07:50.196 --> 00:07:52.126 A:middle
happens to the RGB of values

00:07:52.446 --> 00:07:54.206 A:middle
before and after converting to

00:07:54.206 --> 00:07:55.926 A:middle
display P3 from an sRGB

00:07:55.926 --> 00:07:56.436 A:middle
Gradient.

00:07:56.636 --> 00:07:57.596 A:middle
And we're going to look at the

00:07:57.726 --> 00:08:00.236 A:middle
red color spefically here.

00:08:00.986 --> 00:08:02.406 A:middle
Now in this sRGB image you can

00:08:02.406 --> 00:08:03.676 A:middle
see that I'll all the way up in

00:08:03.676 --> 00:08:06.286 A:middle
the top right corner and our RGB

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:09.386 A:middle
values are then 255, 0, 0.

00:08:09.386 --> 00:08:10.826 A:middle
That's pretty much as red as it

00:08:10.826 --> 00:08:11.136 A:middle
gets.

00:08:13.196 --> 00:08:15.526 A:middle
But after converting to display

00:08:15.706 --> 00:08:16.836 A:middle
P3 I can now see that I have a

00:08:16.836 --> 00:08:19.286 A:middle
lot more red to work with and I

00:08:19.286 --> 00:08:21.276 A:middle
can also see that my RGB values

00:08:21.396 --> 00:08:23.636 A:middle
has now changed.

00:08:24.676 --> 00:08:26.316 A:middle
So you guys are now ready to go

00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:28.466 A:middle
and create stunning Display P3

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:29.526 A:middle
Assets for your app.

00:08:30.296 --> 00:08:32.336 A:middle
But before you do take a second

00:08:32.336 --> 00:08:34.166 A:middle
and ask the question, should I?

00:08:35.226 --> 00:08:37.076 A:middle
Display P3 works great in some

00:08:37.076 --> 00:08:39.376 A:middle
cases, in others it's just not

00:08:39.426 --> 00:08:40.206 A:middle
the right choice.

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.336 A:middle
For example, if your app is

00:08:42.366 --> 00:08:43.576 A:middle
designed with a calm,

00:08:43.696 --> 00:08:45.596 A:middle
de-saturated color scheme, it

00:08:45.596 --> 00:08:46.866 A:middle
doesn't use a lot of imagery,

00:08:47.186 --> 00:08:48.696 A:middle
display P3 might not be the

00:08:48.696 --> 00:08:50.156 A:middle
right choice for you.

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:52.336 A:middle
But it is great for calling

00:08:52.336 --> 00:08:54.466 A:middle
attention to certain details

00:08:54.466 --> 00:08:56.516 A:middle
within your UI, such like a VU

00:08:56.516 --> 00:08:58.486 A:middle
meter or the red line in the rev

00:08:58.486 --> 00:08:58.836 A:middle
counter.

00:08:59.296 --> 00:09:00.776 A:middle
Or used to smooth out that app

00:09:00.976 --> 00:09:01.996 A:middle
icon gradient.

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:05.116 A:middle
Or if your app uses a lot of

00:09:05.116 --> 00:09:07.096 A:middle
scenic imagery of nature,

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:08.306 A:middle
landscapes, or travel

00:09:08.306 --> 00:09:09.886 A:middle
destinations, this use of

00:09:09.996 --> 00:09:11.926 A:middle
Display P3 makes a whole lot of

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:13.806 A:middle
sense because these images will

00:09:13.806 --> 00:09:15.876 A:middle
look more vibrant and richer and

00:09:15.906 --> 00:09:17.746 A:middle
colors will stay more true to

00:09:17.746 --> 00:09:19.266 A:middle
what they actually looked like

00:09:19.266 --> 00:09:20.406 A:middle
when the camera captured that

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:22.736 A:middle
very specific and special image.

00:09:23.856 --> 00:09:24.946 A:middle
Or for apps that feature

00:09:25.006 --> 00:09:26.886 A:middle
textiles or garments were shown

00:09:26.886 --> 00:09:28.876 A:middle
the true color of a dress or a

00:09:28.876 --> 00:09:30.356 A:middle
pair of pants is immensely

00:09:30.356 --> 00:09:30.836 A:middle
important.

00:09:33.246 --> 00:09:35.576 A:middle
So in conclusion, we have the

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:37.826 A:middle
Display P3 color space and color

00:09:37.826 --> 00:09:38.516 A:middle
profile.

00:09:39.086 --> 00:09:40.936 A:middle
It is 25 percent larger than

00:09:40.936 --> 00:09:43.706 A:middle
sRGB and lots of your users

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:45.746 A:middle
already have compatible devices

00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:47.036 A:middle
in their hands today.

00:09:48.086 --> 00:09:49.666 A:middle
Then keep in mind the special

00:09:49.666 --> 00:09:51.226 A:middle
workflow when creating these

00:09:51.226 --> 00:09:53.326 A:middle
assets and make sure to use it

00:09:53.916 --> 00:09:56.306 A:middle
where it makes sense.

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:57.626 A:middle
Thank you.
