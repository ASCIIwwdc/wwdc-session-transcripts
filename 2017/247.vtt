00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:16.500 A:middle
[ Cheers ]

00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:30.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Whether looking for the

00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:32.446 A:middle
latest TV show to watch or the

00:00:32.446 --> 00:00:33.996 A:middle
best place to grab lunch, you

00:00:33.996 --> 00:00:35.296 A:middle
rely on the people around you

00:00:35.396 --> 00:00:36.426 A:middle
for recommendations.

00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:38.556 A:middle
By offering the ability to share

00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:40.136 A:middle
on Your App, you can empower

00:00:40.136 --> 00:00:41.696 A:middle
your users to give contextual

00:00:41.696 --> 00:00:42.586 A:middle
recommendations.

00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:44.456 A:middle
But there are some important

00:00:44.456 --> 00:00:45.846 A:middle
things to consider before you

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:47.106 A:middle
offer the ability to share.

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:50.286 A:middle
First is the content.

00:00:50.886 --> 00:00:52.206 A:middle
In Your App, what will you want

00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:53.096 A:middle
your user to share?

00:00:53.306 --> 00:00:55.166 A:middle
Is it an image or a video, or

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.646 A:middle
maybe even an experience that

00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:57.466 A:middle
they've had in Your App?

00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:00.146 A:middle
Next is placement.

00:01:00.716 --> 00:01:01.896 A:middle
Where in Your App is the best

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:03.336 A:middle
place to offer the ability to

00:01:03.336 --> 00:01:03.646 A:middle
share?

00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:05.306 A:middle
If you share from a certain

00:01:05.306 --> 00:01:06.776 A:middle
screen, is it contextual?

00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:08.536 A:middle
Will the user know exactly what

00:01:08.536 --> 00:01:10.096 A:middle
will be passed to the recipient?

00:01:11.686 --> 00:01:13.026 A:middle
Timing is another important

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:14.456 A:middle
aspect to building a great

00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:15.416 A:middle
sharing experience.

00:01:16.036 --> 00:01:17.496 A:middle
It needs to be, when a user is

00:01:17.496 --> 00:01:18.576 A:middle
completely connected to the

00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:19.646 A:middle
content they are wanting to

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.126 A:middle
share; and at that moment,

00:01:21.126 --> 00:01:22.686 A:middle
think, "My friend Kate would

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:23.216 A:middle
love this."

00:01:24.636 --> 00:01:25.886 A:middle
The developers of Crossy Road

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.776 A:middle
have a great implementation that

00:01:27.776 --> 00:01:28.916 A:middle
has narrowed all three of these

00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:29.366 A:middle
areas.

00:01:29.976 --> 00:01:31.446 A:middle
They started with an experience.

00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:33.636 A:middle
Now, it's quite common to share

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:35.206 A:middle
your progress in a game, but

00:01:35.206 --> 00:01:36.376 A:middle
losing in Crossy Road is

00:01:36.376 --> 00:01:37.826 A:middle
actually quite comical.

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:39.136 A:middle
They quickly realized that

00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:39.976 A:middle
people are going to want to

00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:41.366 A:middle
share that moment and created a

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:43.486 A:middle
photograph representation and

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:44.816 A:middle
previewed it, ready for sharing.

00:01:45.456 --> 00:01:46.746 A:middle
The timing, content and

00:01:46.746 --> 00:01:47.936 A:middle
placement were all great.

00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:49.776 A:middle
Think about the user of Your

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:49.986 A:middle
App.

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:51.556 A:middle
When are they most emotionally

00:01:51.556 --> 00:01:52.646 A:middle
attached to the experience and

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:55.266 A:middle
going to want to share it?

00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:56.576 A:middle
Another important aspect of

00:01:56.576 --> 00:01:57.876 A:middle
sharing is placement.

00:01:58.486 --> 00:01:59.466 A:middle
It doesn't make sense for a

00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:00.866 A:middle
sharing button in a list view

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:03.136 A:middle
here; but on a detail view, it

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:03.606 A:middle
does.

00:02:03.996 --> 00:02:05.106 A:middle
As I find a session I'm

00:02:05.106 --> 00:02:06.666 A:middle
interested in, I might think of

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:07.676 A:middle
someone else that could be

00:02:07.676 --> 00:02:09.256 A:middle
interested and can very quickly

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:09.656 A:middle
share it.

00:02:10.786 --> 00:02:13.036 A:middle
The way you offer the ability to

00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:14.306 A:middle
share in Your App is with an

00:02:14.306 --> 00:02:15.006 A:middle
action button.

00:02:15.496 --> 00:02:16.996 A:middle
This is the universal control

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:18.546 A:middle
used by all apps to access

00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:18.956 A:middle
sharing.

00:02:19.826 --> 00:02:20.946 A:middle
A great place for an action

00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:22.496 A:middle
button in a detail view like

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:24.086 A:middle
this is in the title bar.

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:25.906 A:middle
It helps communicate to the user

00:02:25.906 --> 00:02:27.026 A:middle
that you can share all the

00:02:27.026 --> 00:02:28.306 A:middle
information in this view.

00:02:29.976 --> 00:02:31.346 A:middle
On tapping that button, you can

00:02:31.346 --> 00:02:33.296 A:middle
call a UIActivityViewController.

00:02:33.856 --> 00:02:35.026 A:middle
This will display the user's

00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:36.006 A:middle
sharing options.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.066 A:middle
By default, the system has some

00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:39.626 A:middle
built-in sharing options, like

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.986 A:middle
messages, mail and notes; but

00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:43.426 A:middle
other options will populate here

00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:45.036 A:middle
from apps that have implemented

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:46.056 A:middle
a share extension.

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:47.526 A:middle
When creating the

00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:49.386 A:middle
UIActivityViewController, you

00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:50.586 A:middle
can parse in pretty much any

00:02:50.586 --> 00:02:53.056 A:middle
object, like a string, image or

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:53.546 A:middle
URL.

00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:55.566 A:middle
But the best way to share the

00:02:55.566 --> 00:02:57.006 A:middle
content of Your App is to use

00:02:57.006 --> 00:02:57.906 A:middle
the universal link.

00:02:58.436 --> 00:02:59.796 A:middle
A universal link looks like a

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:01.946 A:middle
URL, but instead launches Your

00:03:01.946 --> 00:03:02.136 A:middle
App.

00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:05.776 A:middle
At this stage, you might be

00:03:05.776 --> 00:03:07.666 A:middle
asking, "Why share a URL?

00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:08.996 A:middle
This is not a Web page."

00:03:09.406 --> 00:03:10.366 A:middle
Well, you have to consider the

00:03:10.366 --> 00:03:11.526 A:middle
person receiving the shared

00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:12.196 A:middle
information.

00:03:12.596 --> 00:03:13.486 A:middle
They may not have Your App

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:15.756 A:middle
installed; so when tapping a

00:03:15.756 --> 00:03:17.296 A:middle
universal link when Your App is

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:18.656 A:middle
not installed, it will fall back

00:03:18.716 --> 00:03:20.866 A:middle
to Safari, making it possible

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.186 A:middle
for people with Your App to

00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:23.656 A:middle
share content with new people

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:24.936 A:middle
that do not need Your App to

00:03:24.936 --> 00:03:25.606 A:middle
view the content.

00:03:27.336 --> 00:03:28.906 A:middle
Then if a new user receives a

00:03:28.906 --> 00:03:30.156 A:middle
link to the content in Your App,

00:03:30.556 --> 00:03:31.896 A:middle
an app banner can be displayed

00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:33.306 A:middle
in Safari, and it's a great way

00:03:33.306 --> 00:03:34.566 A:middle
to increase awareness of

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:36.086 A:middle
innovative experience to draw

00:03:36.086 --> 00:03:37.316 A:middle
new users of Your App.

00:03:39.196 --> 00:03:40.296 A:middle
Another way you can increase the

00:03:40.296 --> 00:03:41.406 A:middle
sharing experience for the

00:03:41.406 --> 00:03:43.136 A:middle
recipient is to use Mockup in

00:03:43.136 --> 00:03:43.766 A:middle
Open Graph.

00:03:44.366 --> 00:03:45.346 A:middle
Then the content shared in

00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:46.916 A:middle
iMessage can be displayed in a

00:03:46.916 --> 00:03:48.666 A:middle
rich format; so instead of

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:50.716 A:middle
looking like this, it can look

00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:52.536 A:middle
like this -- with an image

00:03:52.536 --> 00:03:53.466 A:middle
preview and title.

00:03:54.106 --> 00:03:55.666 A:middle
The recipient of this message is

00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:56.976 A:middle
much more likely to tap and

00:03:56.976 --> 00:03:57.726 A:middle
follow this link.

00:03:59.146 --> 00:04:00.536 A:middle
So in summary, think about the

00:04:00.536 --> 00:04:02.176 A:middle
content and experiences in Your

00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:02.366 A:middle
App.

00:04:02.436 --> 00:04:04.246 A:middle
What will your user like to

00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:06.866 A:middle
share; and when is the most

00:04:06.866 --> 00:04:07.886 A:middle
meaningful time to share?

00:04:08.346 --> 00:04:09.446 A:middle
Do they know enough about the

00:04:09.446 --> 00:04:10.676 A:middle
content to want to share it?

00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:13.276 A:middle
Use the action button to launch

00:04:13.276 --> 00:04:14.266 A:middle
sharing and consider the

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:15.346 A:middle
placement of that button for

00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:15.946 A:middle
context.

00:04:16.796 --> 00:04:18.076 A:middle
Universal links will work with

00:04:18.076 --> 00:04:19.386 A:middle
recipients that don't have Your

00:04:19.386 --> 00:04:21.036 A:middle
App, and app banners can guide

00:04:21.036 --> 00:04:22.906 A:middle
them to Your App.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.846 A:middle
Finally, mock up your Web page

00:04:24.846 --> 00:04:26.766 A:middle
with Open Graph for rich sharing

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:27.556 A:middle
in iMessage.

00:04:28.886 --> 00:04:30.246 A:middle
For more information, see the

00:04:30.246 --> 00:04:31.736 A:middle
resources section of this video.

00:04:32.246 --> 00:04:33.276 A:middle
Thank you, and feel free to

00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:33.646 A:middle
share it!
