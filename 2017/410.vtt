00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:20.886 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:21.386 --> 00:00:23.766 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon and welcome to

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.246 A:middle
Localizing Content for Swift

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:25.956 A:middle
Playgrounds.

00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:27.356 A:middle
I am Alex Kuhn.

00:00:27.476 --> 00:00:28.806 A:middle
I'm an engineer on the Content

00:00:28.806 --> 00:00:29.886 A:middle
team, developing content for

00:00:29.886 --> 00:00:31.366 A:middle
Swift Playgrounds, and I'll be

00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.696 A:middle
joined later by Aaltan Ahmad

00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:33.926 A:middle
from the Internationalization

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:34.206 A:middle
Team.

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:37.686 A:middle
Now it's a big world out there

00:00:38.086 --> 00:00:39.646 A:middle
full of many different diverse

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:40.836 A:middle
people that would love to use

00:00:40.836 --> 00:00:42.276 A:middle
the amazing content that you

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.846 A:middle
build in Swift Playgrounds.

00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:46.536 A:middle
However, at Swift Playgrounds,

00:00:46.536 --> 00:00:47.816 A:middle
right now we have over a million

00:00:47.816 --> 00:00:48.416 A:middle
users.

00:00:48.776 --> 00:00:50.166 A:middle
Except nearly two-thirds of them

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.186 A:middle
are outside the US.

00:00:51.596 --> 00:00:52.736 A:middle
So for them to be able to use

00:00:52.736 --> 00:00:54.376 A:middle
your amazing content you need to

00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:56.226 A:middle
localize it to hit this whole

00:00:56.226 --> 00:00:58.066 A:middle
world, is what we'll talk about

00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:58.366 A:middle
today.

00:00:58.946 --> 00:01:01.146 A:middle
So a little bit of history on

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:02.056 A:middle
Swift Playgrounds.

00:01:02.326 --> 00:01:04.206 A:middle
This is an iPad app that enables

00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:06.016 A:middle
you to write Swift code and see

00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:07.516 A:middle
the results of it executed live.

00:01:08.216 --> 00:01:09.866 A:middle
And along with Swift Playgrounds

00:01:10.156 --> 00:01:11.256 A:middle
we've released a curriculum

00:01:11.536 --> 00:01:12.986 A:middle
teaching a beginner the basics

00:01:12.986 --> 00:01:13.876 A:middle
of learning the code.

00:01:14.546 --> 00:01:16.216 A:middle
And also, there is different

00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:17.906 A:middle
coding challenges such as

00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:19.356 A:middle
writing the logic for the game

00:01:19.356 --> 00:01:19.956 A:middle
of Battleship.

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.956 A:middle
Now this was initially released

00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:25.996 A:middle
in English, but we have since

00:01:25.996 --> 00:01:27.726 A:middle
translated that into five

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:28.896 A:middle
additional languages.

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:30.966 A:middle
Spanish. French.

00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:33.786 A:middle
German. Simplified Chinese and

00:01:33.786 --> 00:01:34.476 A:middle
Japanese.

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:36.306 A:middle
And we have more coming soon.

00:01:37.216 --> 00:01:39.226 A:middle
And in localizing the content,

00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:40.586 A:middle
we had a number of different

00:01:40.586 --> 00:01:42.486 A:middle
challenges and issues that we

00:01:42.486 --> 00:01:43.536 A:middle
had to encounter and work

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.366 A:middle
through in order to have a great

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:46.926 A:middle
experience for our users.

00:01:47.576 --> 00:01:48.766 A:middle
And so this is what we want to

00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:49.966 A:middle
talk about some of the lessons

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:52.176 A:middle
learned for you, when you make

00:01:52.176 --> 00:01:52.886 A:middle
your own content.

00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:55.086 A:middle
So today we'll give an overview

00:01:55.086 --> 00:01:56.736 A:middle
of what is content and Swift

00:01:56.736 --> 00:01:57.946 A:middle
Playgrounds and some of the

00:01:57.946 --> 00:01:58.816 A:middle
challenges around it.

00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:00.726 A:middle
And we'll talk through some of

00:02:00.726 --> 00:02:02.336 A:middle
the localization considerations

00:02:02.616 --> 00:02:03.906 A:middle
when you are making your own

00:02:03.906 --> 00:02:05.076 A:middle
content and localizing it.

00:02:05.546 --> 00:02:07.866 A:middle
And lastly, we'll go through

00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:08.986 A:middle
what is the structure of a

00:02:08.986 --> 00:02:10.386 A:middle
localized Playground book so

00:02:10.546 --> 00:02:11.826 A:middle
that you can make your books

00:02:11.826 --> 00:02:12.916 A:middle
localizable today.

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:16.956 A:middle
Now before we begin talking

00:02:16.956 --> 00:02:18.486 A:middle
about localization, it's

00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:19.976 A:middle
something that's really critical

00:02:20.026 --> 00:02:22.276 A:middle
is to define your content goals.

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:24.426 A:middle
And this is important because

00:02:24.426 --> 00:02:25.376 A:middle
when you build the content

00:02:25.376 --> 00:02:26.876 A:middle
initially, when it goes to

00:02:26.876 --> 00:02:28.226 A:middle
localization, you need to be

00:02:28.226 --> 00:02:29.646 A:middle
able to tell someone else what

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:31.176 A:middle
exactly your goals were, and

00:02:31.176 --> 00:02:32.476 A:middle
what do you want the experience

00:02:32.476 --> 00:02:34.226 A:middle
for that user to be like in any

00:02:34.296 --> 00:02:35.726 A:middle
language, since it's not going

00:02:35.726 --> 00:02:37.496 A:middle
to be you necessarily doing all

00:02:37.496 --> 00:02:38.446 A:middle
of the translations.

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:41.956 A:middle
So to give an example of the

00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:44.336 A:middle
content goals we had and learned

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:47.166 A:middle
at code.

00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:48.856 A:middle
For one, it was instructional.

00:02:49.476 --> 00:02:50.126 A:middle
We're trying to teach the

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:51.926 A:middle
beginner the basics of coding in

00:02:51.926 --> 00:02:53.766 A:middle
Swift, assuming no prior

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:54.366 A:middle
knowledge.

00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:56.766 A:middle
However, we also want it to be

00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:57.756 A:middle
fun and engaging.

00:02:58.226 --> 00:02:59.156 A:middle
It shouldn't be like a dry

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:00.656 A:middle
textbook, but rather something

00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:02.756 A:middle
the user wants to use and is

00:03:02.756 --> 00:03:04.206 A:middle
engaged with coding and learning

00:03:04.206 --> 00:03:04.636 A:middle
more.

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:07.826 A:middle
And we chose to target the ages

00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:08.606 A:middle
of 12 and up.

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:11.616 A:middle
So whether you're 12 or 112,

00:03:12.176 --> 00:03:12.876 A:middle
we'd love for you to have a

00:03:12.876 --> 00:03:14.436 A:middle
great experience using our

00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:14.896 A:middle
content.

00:03:14.926 --> 00:03:17.806 A:middle
Now just to get an overview of

00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:19.296 A:middle
what this translates to and

00:03:19.296 --> 00:03:21.076 A:middle
learn the code, here you see

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.476 A:middle
this page is about learning

00:03:22.476 --> 00:03:24.046 A:middle
about debugging and finding and

00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:24.846 A:middle
fixing bugs.

00:03:25.386 --> 00:03:26.626 A:middle
Something I'm sure many of you

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:27.666 A:middle
are quite familiar with.

00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:29.676 A:middle
However, to a learner this is

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:30.526 A:middle
the first time they're being

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:31.686 A:middle
introduced to the concept.

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:34.176 A:middle
Now on the right here we have a

00:03:34.176 --> 00:03:34.866 A:middle
live view.

00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:37.536 A:middle
In this case it's a 3D animated

00:03:37.536 --> 00:03:39.166 A:middle
puzzle world where you're trying

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:40.446 A:middle
to write code to solve different

00:03:40.446 --> 00:03:41.716 A:middle
puzzles and collect gems.

00:03:42.436 --> 00:03:44.926 A:middle
There's also a prose area that

00:03:44.926 --> 00:03:46.476 A:middle
provides instructional content

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.166 A:middle
and the goals on a page and the

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.126 A:middle
tasks a learner needs to

00:03:49.126 --> 00:03:49.616 A:middle
perform.

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:52.716 A:middle
And then, of course, the coding

00:03:52.716 --> 00:03:53.856 A:middle
area where they can write and

00:03:53.856 --> 00:03:55.226 A:middle
edit Swift code to solve the

00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:55.606 A:middle
puzzle.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.336 A:middle
So going back to those goals,

00:03:58.876 --> 00:03:59.556 A:middle
one of ours is to be

00:03:59.556 --> 00:04:00.316 A:middle
instructional.

00:04:00.696 --> 00:04:02.346 A:middle
So we are actually defining what

00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:04.016 A:middle
the term "bug" and "debugging"

00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:05.306 A:middle
means to a learner who might

00:04:05.306 --> 00:04:06.326 A:middle
never have experienced this

00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:06.796 A:middle
before.

00:04:06.796 --> 00:04:07.906 A:middle
And this is something that needs

00:04:07.906 --> 00:04:08.896 A:middle
to be kept into mind with

00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:10.596 A:middle
localization which I'll tie back

00:04:10.596 --> 00:04:11.076 A:middle
to later.

00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:12.756 A:middle
And throughout the course of the

00:04:12.756 --> 00:04:14.466 A:middle
curriculum, there are many such

00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:15.616 A:middle
definitions that occur

00:04:15.616 --> 00:04:16.446 A:middle
gradually.

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:18.956 A:middle
And in the end, there's a whole

00:04:18.956 --> 00:04:20.176 A:middle
glossary of terms that the

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:21.926 A:middle
learner gets exposed to when

00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:22.926 A:middle
they go through the curriculum

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:24.336 A:middle
that has gradually built up to,

00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:25.846 A:middle
and this needs to be taken into

00:04:25.846 --> 00:04:27.786 A:middle
account when you localize it.

00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:30.716 A:middle
Now one other feature in the

00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:32.546 A:middle
system is that when the learner

00:04:32.546 --> 00:04:34.536 A:middle
runs their code, the system is

00:04:34.536 --> 00:04:36.216 A:middle
analyzing what the learner has

00:04:36.216 --> 00:04:37.586 A:middle
done and is trying to help

00:04:37.586 --> 00:04:39.026 A:middle
provide corrective feedback.

00:04:39.226 --> 00:04:40.396 A:middle
Trying to give him instruction

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:41.596 A:middle
of how to improve or fix what

00:04:41.596 --> 00:04:41.976 A:middle
they did.

00:04:42.466 --> 00:04:43.976 A:middle
So here you'll see that animated

00:04:43.976 --> 00:04:45.396 A:middle
character, Byte, failed to

00:04:45.396 --> 00:04:46.166 A:middle
collect the gem.

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:48.176 A:middle
And the learner tapped on the

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:49.606 A:middle
hint saying, "Did you notice

00:04:49.606 --> 00:04:50.216 A:middle
that bug?

00:04:50.526 --> 00:04:51.576 A:middle
Byte tried to collect a gem that

00:04:51.576 --> 00:04:52.246 A:middle
wasn't there."

00:04:52.806 --> 00:04:54.226 A:middle
So here we're taking a

00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:56.026 A:middle
conversational tone trying to be

00:04:56.026 --> 00:04:56.896 A:middle
a little bit more fun and

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:58.776 A:middle
engaging, while at the same time

00:04:58.776 --> 00:05:00.266 A:middle
giving instructional feedback

00:05:00.586 --> 00:05:01.546 A:middle
saying that they need to use

00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:03.666 A:middle
collect gem, the function, when

00:05:03.666 --> 00:05:05.336 A:middle
they're under a particular gem.

00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:09.136 A:middle
So when this page is put into

00:05:09.136 --> 00:05:10.966 A:middle
Chinese, you'll notice that

00:05:10.966 --> 00:05:12.096 A:middle
while the code is in English

00:05:12.396 --> 00:05:13.986 A:middle
everything else is localized.

00:05:13.986 --> 00:05:15.076 A:middle
And we're still teaching these

00:05:15.076 --> 00:05:16.916 A:middle
exact same concepts, but in a

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.446 A:middle
way that is appropriate to the

00:05:18.446 --> 00:05:19.096 A:middle
language.

00:05:19.446 --> 00:05:20.306 A:middle
So they're still learning about

00:05:20.306 --> 00:05:21.466 A:middle
bugs and debugging, but they

00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:22.756 A:middle
need to be able to relate it

00:05:22.756 --> 00:05:24.266 A:middle
back to the code that they're

00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:25.306 A:middle
seeing on the page.

00:05:26.366 --> 00:05:29.216 A:middle
And similarly, those hints -- we

00:05:29.306 --> 00:05:30.566 A:middle
want to maintain that similar

00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:32.426 A:middle
style, but you'll notice that

00:05:32.426 --> 00:05:33.896 A:middle
we're referencing to the collect

00:05:33.896 --> 00:05:35.626 A:middle
gem command in English.

00:05:35.726 --> 00:05:36.936 A:middle
So this is one of the things

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:37.956 A:middle
that challenges around

00:05:37.956 --> 00:05:39.846 A:middle
localization of dealing with

00:05:39.876 --> 00:05:40.716 A:middle
these various different

00:05:40.716 --> 00:05:42.886 A:middle
technical terms as well as code

00:05:42.886 --> 00:05:44.286 A:middle
in English that we'll talk more

00:05:44.286 --> 00:05:44.866 A:middle
about later.

00:05:47.376 --> 00:05:49.406 A:middle
Now one other feature in Swift

00:05:49.406 --> 00:05:50.976 A:middle
Playgrounds is we use animated

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:52.406 A:middle
cut scenes to introduce a

00:05:52.406 --> 00:05:54.536 A:middle
concept at high level before the

00:05:54.536 --> 00:05:55.796 A:middle
learner dives into coding.

00:05:56.476 --> 00:05:57.866 A:middle
So in this case, learner is

00:05:57.866 --> 00:05:58.656 A:middle
learning about what an "if

00:05:58.656 --> 00:05:59.786 A:middle
statement" is before they

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:00.686 A:middle
proceed to use it.

00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:04.706 A:middle
And when this is localized, the

00:06:04.706 --> 00:06:06.056 A:middle
localization has to take into

00:06:06.056 --> 00:06:08.126 A:middle
account how helping the learner

00:06:08.186 --> 00:06:09.336 A:middle
to actually do the task.

00:06:09.666 --> 00:06:10.846 A:middle
So we're still mentioning if

00:06:10.846 --> 00:06:13.146 A:middle
statement -- the if command in

00:06:13.146 --> 00:06:15.426 A:middle
English, even though everything

00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:17.116 A:middle
else is in Chinese because

00:06:17.116 --> 00:06:17.936 A:middle
that's how they're going to need

00:06:17.936 --> 00:06:19.316 A:middle
to solve the puzzles later when

00:06:19.316 --> 00:06:20.136 A:middle
they write Swift Code.

00:06:20.726 --> 00:06:23.456 A:middle
So that's a little overview of

00:06:23.456 --> 00:06:23.906 A:middle
the content.

00:06:23.906 --> 00:06:25.626 A:middle
But I'm just going to step back

00:06:25.626 --> 00:06:26.576 A:middle
a moment and talk about the

00:06:26.576 --> 00:06:28.106 A:middle
process of building localized

00:06:28.106 --> 00:06:28.506 A:middle
content.

00:06:29.716 --> 00:06:31.366 A:middle
And a common approach that many

00:06:31.366 --> 00:06:33.746 A:middle
people might take is that you

00:06:33.746 --> 00:06:35.286 A:middle
define your goals and you build

00:06:35.286 --> 00:06:36.936 A:middle
up the content in one language;

00:06:37.076 --> 00:06:38.346 A:middle
testing and iterating it.

00:06:38.346 --> 00:06:39.946 A:middle
Testing it with your users and

00:06:39.946 --> 00:06:40.726 A:middle
making sure you have a great

00:06:40.726 --> 00:06:41.496 A:middle
experience.

00:06:41.936 --> 00:06:42.826 A:middle
Then you decide you want to

00:06:42.826 --> 00:06:43.496 A:middle
localize it.

00:06:43.496 --> 00:06:44.896 A:middle
So then you send it off to your

00:06:44.896 --> 00:06:47.286 A:middle
translators and localize it and

00:06:47.286 --> 00:06:48.646 A:middle
then you get it back and ship

00:06:48.646 --> 00:06:48.786 A:middle
it.

00:06:49.166 --> 00:06:49.896 A:middle
You're done, right?

00:06:51.466 --> 00:06:52.906 A:middle
Unfortunately, this has many

00:06:52.906 --> 00:06:53.506 A:middle
problems.

00:06:54.006 --> 00:06:55.046 A:middle
You may find when you send it

00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:56.306 A:middle
off to be translated that your

00:06:56.306 --> 00:06:57.926 A:middle
content isn't localizable.

00:06:58.466 --> 00:07:00.496 A:middle
Or that there are different

00:07:00.496 --> 00:07:02.176 A:middle
issues in the translation, and

00:07:02.176 --> 00:07:03.336 A:middle
it's not actually hitting the

00:07:03.336 --> 00:07:05.026 A:middle
goals you're seeking at the same

00:07:05.026 --> 00:07:05.866 A:middle
level as when you first

00:07:05.866 --> 00:07:07.676 A:middle
developed it in one language.

00:07:09.086 --> 00:07:10.716 A:middle
So what is the better approach?

00:07:11.196 --> 00:07:14.726 A:middle
Well, for one, localization is

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.146 A:middle
part of the design process.

00:07:16.906 --> 00:07:17.866 A:middle
You should be thinking about

00:07:17.866 --> 00:07:19.156 A:middle
localization when you are

00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:20.696 A:middle
designing out your content goals

00:07:20.696 --> 00:07:21.666 A:middle
and the initial design of the

00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:24.426 A:middle
product in order to avoid costly

00:07:24.426 --> 00:07:26.666 A:middle
mistakes later that prevent

00:07:26.666 --> 00:07:28.286 A:middle
content from being localized.

00:07:28.766 --> 00:07:30.396 A:middle
And this is no different than

00:07:30.396 --> 00:07:31.036 A:middle
what you should do with

00:07:31.036 --> 00:07:31.866 A:middle
accessibility.

00:07:32.236 --> 00:07:33.726 A:middle
Thinking about it during the

00:07:33.726 --> 00:07:35.066 A:middle
design process instead of

00:07:35.116 --> 00:07:35.866 A:middle
afterwards.

00:07:36.196 --> 00:07:37.276 A:middle
Which is what enables you to

00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:38.276 A:middle
make it a really amazing

00:07:38.276 --> 00:07:38.746 A:middle
product.

00:07:40.156 --> 00:07:41.966 A:middle
So a better way to think about

00:07:41.966 --> 00:07:44.316 A:middle
this diagram, is -- the process

00:07:44.316 --> 00:07:46.676 A:middle
is to define your goals and

00:07:46.676 --> 00:07:48.346 A:middle
design out the content thinking

00:07:48.346 --> 00:07:49.376 A:middle
about localization.

00:07:50.066 --> 00:07:52.346 A:middle
And then when you send it off to

00:07:52.346 --> 00:07:53.826 A:middle
be localized, you make sure that

00:07:53.826 --> 00:07:54.966 A:middle
your translators really

00:07:54.966 --> 00:07:57.196 A:middle
understand your goals and what

00:07:57.196 --> 00:07:59.136 A:middle
your content is, so that they

00:07:59.136 --> 00:08:00.716 A:middle
can translate it appropriately

00:08:00.916 --> 00:08:02.196 A:middle
for each language to

00:08:02.196 --> 00:08:03.886 A:middle
consistently hit those goals.

00:08:04.426 --> 00:08:05.716 A:middle
And this may take several rounds

00:08:05.716 --> 00:08:07.136 A:middle
of iteration when you translate

00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:07.276 A:middle
it.

00:08:07.766 --> 00:08:09.236 A:middle
So during this time it's really

00:08:09.236 --> 00:08:10.726 A:middle
critical to test with actual

00:08:10.726 --> 00:08:12.616 A:middle
users, as they're the ones who

00:08:12.616 --> 00:08:14.006 A:middle
you're trying to serve and they

00:08:14.006 --> 00:08:14.976 A:middle
can tell you if you're doing it

00:08:14.976 --> 00:08:16.196 A:middle
right or wrong or if it's

00:08:16.196 --> 00:08:17.346 A:middle
actually meeting their needs and

00:08:17.346 --> 00:08:18.026 A:middle
understandable.

00:08:19.006 --> 00:08:20.776 A:middle
And of course, during this

00:08:20.776 --> 00:08:22.576 A:middle
process you may find you need to

00:08:22.576 --> 00:08:23.896 A:middle
go back and adapt your original

00:08:23.896 --> 00:08:25.686 A:middle
content due to some issues you

00:08:25.686 --> 00:08:26.916 A:middle
found that prevent it from being

00:08:26.916 --> 00:08:27.826 A:middle
localized fully.

00:08:28.326 --> 00:08:29.636 A:middle
But hopefully because you've

00:08:29.636 --> 00:08:30.356 A:middle
considered this in the

00:08:30.356 --> 00:08:31.806 A:middle
beginning, these changes are

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:32.716 A:middle
relatively minor.

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:34.956 A:middle
So this is a much better

00:08:34.956 --> 00:08:36.256 A:middle
approach to taking and thinking

00:08:36.256 --> 00:08:37.256 A:middle
about building localized

00:08:37.256 --> 00:08:37.756 A:middle
content.

00:08:38.946 --> 00:08:40.666 A:middle
Now I'll hand it over to Aaltan

00:08:40.666 --> 00:08:41.746 A:middle
to talk about localization

00:08:41.746 --> 00:08:42.576 A:middle
considerations.

00:08:43.266 --> 00:08:43.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Alex.

00:08:44.646 --> 00:08:46.226 A:middle
So today I'm going to talk to

00:08:46.226 --> 00:08:48.916 A:middle
you about the process that we

00:08:49.076 --> 00:08:50.336 A:middle
went through when we localized

00:08:50.336 --> 00:08:52.236 A:middle
Swift Playgrounds, and some of

00:08:52.236 --> 00:08:53.666 A:middle
the key areas that you should be

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.006 A:middle
thinking about when you are

00:08:55.006 --> 00:08:55.976 A:middle
localizing your own Swift

00:08:55.976 --> 00:08:56.556 A:middle
Playgrounds.

00:08:58.006 --> 00:08:59.996 A:middle
So let's go back to that diagram

00:08:59.996 --> 00:09:02.156 A:middle
that Alex introduced to you and

00:09:02.226 --> 00:09:03.516 A:middle
let's talk first about the

00:09:03.516 --> 00:09:06.406 A:middle
process of actually adapting our

00:09:06.406 --> 00:09:09.296 A:middle
own content and goals while

00:09:09.296 --> 00:09:10.596 A:middle
thinking about localization to

00:09:10.596 --> 00:09:12.146 A:middle
begin with before we even start

00:09:12.146 --> 00:09:13.106 A:middle
the actual process of

00:09:13.106 --> 00:09:13.706 A:middle
translation.

00:09:15.156 --> 00:09:16.076 A:middle
and the important thing to

00:09:16.076 --> 00:09:17.376 A:middle
remember here is that your

00:09:17.376 --> 00:09:19.156 A:middle
content choices affect your

00:09:19.156 --> 00:09:20.406 A:middle
localizability of your

00:09:20.406 --> 00:09:20.986 A:middle
playground.

00:09:21.626 --> 00:09:23.546 A:middle
So, for example, if you have a

00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:24.836 A:middle
storyline running through your

00:09:24.836 --> 00:09:27.246 A:middle
prose, or a particular style of

00:09:27.286 --> 00:09:29.216 A:middle
writing that involves wordplay

00:09:29.216 --> 00:09:31.116 A:middle
or puns, this is something that

00:09:31.116 --> 00:09:32.126 A:middle
is really important to

00:09:32.126 --> 00:09:33.306 A:middle
communicate to the people who

00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:35.086 A:middle
are actually translating your

00:09:35.086 --> 00:09:36.236 A:middle
playground, so that they can

00:09:36.236 --> 00:09:37.576 A:middle
maintain that feeling in their

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:38.316 A:middle
own languages.

00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:41.306 A:middle
Additionally, there may -- the

00:09:41.306 --> 00:09:42.446 A:middle
concepts that you are trying to

00:09:42.446 --> 00:09:43.756 A:middle
teach may be tied to a

00:09:43.756 --> 00:09:45.046 A:middle
particular language in the first

00:09:45.046 --> 00:09:45.476 A:middle
place.

00:09:45.926 --> 00:09:47.176 A:middle
And so you're going to need to

00:09:47.176 --> 00:09:49.356 A:middle
think about adapting these for

00:09:50.176 --> 00:09:50.996 A:middle
localization.

00:09:52.296 --> 00:09:54.036 A:middle
And we can take the example of

00:09:54.036 --> 00:09:55.846 A:middle
Cipher, which is a playground

00:09:55.846 --> 00:09:57.206 A:middle
that we developed where we try

00:09:57.206 --> 00:09:59.176 A:middle
to teach the learner about coded

00:09:59.476 --> 00:10:02.506 A:middle
messages and encryption through

00:10:02.506 --> 00:10:04.616 A:middle
a very story-like setting where

00:10:04.616 --> 00:10:06.236 A:middle
their place is a detective and

00:10:06.236 --> 00:10:07.506 A:middle
follow clues to solve the

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:07.976 A:middle
mystery.

00:10:08.486 --> 00:10:09.696 A:middle
So here their adding style is

00:10:09.696 --> 00:10:12.366 A:middle
actually kind of unique where we

00:10:12.366 --> 00:10:13.776 A:middle
really place the reader in the

00:10:13.776 --> 00:10:15.446 A:middle
setting of the storyline.

00:10:15.446 --> 00:10:17.276 A:middle
So here we say, "The library is

00:10:17.276 --> 00:10:18.016 A:middle
warm and quiet.

00:10:18.016 --> 00:10:19.076 A:middle
A welcome relief from the

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:20.506 A:middle
howling snowstorm outside."

00:10:21.196 --> 00:10:22.386 A:middle
And this will be something that

00:10:22.386 --> 00:10:23.416 A:middle
you want to communicate to

00:10:23.416 --> 00:10:24.446 A:middle
translators so that they can

00:10:24.446 --> 00:10:26.056 A:middle
maintain that same narrative

00:10:26.056 --> 00:10:28.196 A:middle
feel, otherwise that friendly,

00:10:28.196 --> 00:10:30.976 A:middle
playful feeling might get lost.

00:10:31.406 --> 00:10:34.776 A:middle
Another part about Cipher is the

00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:35.416 A:middle
clues.

00:10:35.946 --> 00:10:38.526 A:middle
So we have a clue where often

00:10:38.896 --> 00:10:40.386 A:middle
you can bring one of the coded

00:10:40.386 --> 00:10:42.576 A:middle
messages, the learner is told to

00:10:42.576 --> 00:10:44.516 A:middle
look to N for the answer to the

00:10:44.516 --> 00:10:45.536 A:middle
next challenges.

00:10:46.356 --> 00:10:47.516 A:middle
And we actually call this out in

00:10:47.516 --> 00:10:48.776 A:middle
the prose as well, where we say

00:10:48.776 --> 00:10:50.116 A:middle
the message says, "look to N."

00:10:50.426 --> 00:10:51.586 A:middle
Who or what is N?

00:10:52.876 --> 00:10:54.656 A:middle
And right here you can see that

00:10:54.656 --> 00:10:55.896 A:middle
there's an interesting challenge

00:10:55.896 --> 00:10:57.086 A:middle
with the letter N itself.

00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:58.866 A:middle
Different languages have

00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:01.206 A:middle
different alphabets, and some

00:11:01.206 --> 00:11:02.546 A:middle
languages may not even have the

00:11:02.546 --> 00:11:03.636 A:middle
letter N in their alphabet.

00:11:04.076 --> 00:11:04.996 A:middle
And so this is something you'll

00:11:04.996 --> 00:11:05.726 A:middle
want to consider.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.786 A:middle
If the letter N is particularly

00:11:08.866 --> 00:11:10.146 A:middle
tied to your challenge or

00:11:10.146 --> 00:11:11.876 A:middle
finding clues or investigating

00:11:11.876 --> 00:11:13.916 A:middle
certain things in the puzzle,

00:11:13.996 --> 00:11:15.246 A:middle
that might be a problem down the

00:11:15.246 --> 00:11:16.596 A:middle
road for localizability.

00:11:17.056 --> 00:11:18.416 A:middle
So you want to give translators

00:11:18.416 --> 00:11:20.216 A:middle
the freedom to take this letter

00:11:20.216 --> 00:11:22.456 A:middle
N and actually adapt it to what

00:11:22.496 --> 00:11:23.576 A:middle
feels most comfortable and

00:11:23.576 --> 00:11:27.256 A:middle
natural for their language.

00:11:28.716 --> 00:11:30.626 A:middle
So in Cipher we actually try to

00:11:30.626 --> 00:11:32.026 A:middle
teach the learner about

00:11:32.446 --> 00:11:33.246 A:middle
encryption.

00:11:33.246 --> 00:11:35.206 A:middle
And we do this through a simple

00:11:35.206 --> 00:11:36.386 A:middle
substitution cipher.

00:11:36.866 --> 00:11:38.196 A:middle
And in a substitution cipher you

00:11:38.196 --> 00:11:40.006 A:middle
take your alphabet and you shift

00:11:40.006 --> 00:11:41.466 A:middle
it by a certain number of

00:11:41.466 --> 00:11:43.376 A:middle
letters to create a new mapping.

00:11:43.926 --> 00:11:45.246 A:middle
And using that mapping you can

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:47.106 A:middle
take a plain text word like

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:49.746 A:middle
Cipher and encrypt it so it

00:11:49.746 --> 00:11:51.106 A:middle
can't be deciphered without the

00:11:51.106 --> 00:11:51.596 A:middle
right key.

00:11:52.986 --> 00:11:54.496 A:middle
And This works great in English.

00:11:55.136 --> 00:11:56.106 A:middle
But when you translate your

00:11:56.106 --> 00:11:57.676 A:middle
playground and hand it to

00:11:57.676 --> 00:11:59.036 A:middle
someone who's a Spanish speaker,

00:11:59.706 --> 00:12:00.946 A:middle
probably they're going to end up

00:12:00.946 --> 00:12:03.206 A:middle
typing a letter enye, which was

00:12:03.206 --> 00:12:04.546 A:middle
not in your original alphabet.

00:12:05.466 --> 00:12:06.846 A:middle
And if you hadn't thought about

00:12:06.846 --> 00:12:08.266 A:middle
this beforehand, you're going to

00:12:08.266 --> 00:12:09.606 A:middle
be in a situation where maybe a

00:12:09.606 --> 00:12:10.996 A:middle
learner can't solve the next

00:12:11.326 --> 00:12:12.946 A:middle
step of the puzzle, or decrypt

00:12:12.946 --> 00:12:14.386 A:middle
the particular message because

00:12:14.386 --> 00:12:15.116 A:middle
it doesn't work in their

00:12:15.116 --> 00:12:15.586 A:middle
language.

00:12:16.466 --> 00:12:17.576 A:middle
So really, these are the kinds

00:12:17.576 --> 00:12:18.486 A:middle
of things you want to look out

00:12:18.486 --> 00:12:19.456 A:middle
for when you're planning your

00:12:19.496 --> 00:12:20.476 A:middle
content and your puzzles.

00:12:23.236 --> 00:12:24.746 A:middle
Another strategy you can take

00:12:25.046 --> 00:12:27.036 A:middle
when planning out your content

00:12:27.036 --> 00:12:28.756 A:middle
is to actually make it language

00:12:28.756 --> 00:12:29.926 A:middle
agnostic to begin with.

00:12:30.586 --> 00:12:32.976 A:middle
So if you plan it out in a way

00:12:32.976 --> 00:12:34.166 A:middle
that doesn't -- is not

00:12:34.166 --> 00:12:35.336 A:middle
particularly tied to any

00:12:35.396 --> 00:12:36.846 A:middle
particular language or culture,

00:12:36.846 --> 00:12:39.446 A:middle
you can avoid that problem to

00:12:39.446 --> 00:12:39.986 A:middle
begin with.

00:12:40.056 --> 00:12:41.536 A:middle
And that's exactly what we did

00:12:41.536 --> 00:12:43.296 A:middle
with Learn to Code.

00:12:43.886 --> 00:12:45.036 A:middle
We have a made up character,

00:12:45.036 --> 00:12:46.526 A:middle
Byte, in a made up world, that

00:12:46.526 --> 00:12:47.436 A:middle
is free from any kind of

00:12:47.526 --> 00:12:49.546 A:middle
cultural or linguistic ties.

00:12:50.076 --> 00:12:51.916 A:middle
So the translation and

00:12:51.916 --> 00:12:53.336 A:middle
localization process becomes a

00:12:53.336 --> 00:12:54.816 A:middle
lot easier because this puzzle

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:55.976 A:middle
is pretty much the same, no

00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:56.956 A:middle
matter what language it's

00:12:56.956 --> 00:12:57.336 A:middle
running in.

00:12:57.686 --> 00:12:59.176 A:middle
Collecting a gem is collecting a

00:12:59.176 --> 00:12:59.496 A:middle
gem.

00:13:00.076 --> 00:13:01.496 A:middle
Whether it's in English or in

00:13:01.496 --> 00:13:02.016 A:middle
Spanish.

00:13:03.636 --> 00:13:05.606 A:middle
So that's another strategy you

00:13:06.276 --> 00:13:07.596 A:middle
can use.

00:13:08.276 --> 00:13:11.376 A:middle
Once you've actually planned out

00:13:11.376 --> 00:13:12.496 A:middle
your goals and your content, and

00:13:12.496 --> 00:13:13.596 A:middle
you feel like you're in a good

00:13:13.646 --> 00:13:15.726 A:middle
place with localization and

00:13:15.726 --> 00:13:16.656 A:middle
you're ready to actually

00:13:16.656 --> 00:13:19.156 A:middle
translate, there are a few key

00:13:19.156 --> 00:13:20.526 A:middle
areas that you should keep in

00:13:20.526 --> 00:13:22.096 A:middle
mind when doing this.

00:13:22.256 --> 00:13:23.606 A:middle
So let's talk about the actual

00:13:23.606 --> 00:13:24.736 A:middle
translation process.

00:13:26.566 --> 00:13:27.566 A:middle
The first important thing to

00:13:27.566 --> 00:13:29.636 A:middle
consider is your audience.

00:13:30.146 --> 00:13:32.536 A:middle
So different languages have

00:13:32.536 --> 00:13:33.946 A:middle
different levels of formality.

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:36.986 A:middle
In English you are you, no

00:13:36.986 --> 00:13:38.276 A:middle
matter what the context.

00:13:38.386 --> 00:13:39.926 A:middle
We don't make any distinction

00:13:40.266 --> 00:13:42.176 A:middle
between addressing someone using

00:13:42.176 --> 00:13:42.796 A:middle
the word, "you".

00:13:43.326 --> 00:13:45.506 A:middle
However, most languages other

00:13:45.506 --> 00:13:46.876 A:middle
than English actually do make a

00:13:46.876 --> 00:13:48.416 A:middle
distinction here such as German

00:13:48.416 --> 00:13:49.036 A:middle
and French.

00:13:49.486 --> 00:13:50.766 A:middle
You can see in German, in an

00:13:50.766 --> 00:13:52.236 A:middle
informal context you would refer

00:13:52.236 --> 00:13:53.146 A:middle
to someone as du.

00:13:53.696 --> 00:13:55.196 A:middle
And in informal context, you

00:13:55.196 --> 00:13:56.796 A:middle
would refer to someone as Sie.

00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:58.266 A:middle
and same for French.

00:13:59.276 --> 00:14:01.316 A:middle
And an important thing to note

00:14:01.316 --> 00:14:02.996 A:middle
about these languages is that

00:14:02.996 --> 00:14:05.086 A:middle
children's texts here are

00:14:05.086 --> 00:14:07.666 A:middle
actually written in the informal

00:14:07.666 --> 00:14:08.096 A:middle
voice.

00:14:08.156 --> 00:14:09.456 A:middle
And this goes a long way to

00:14:09.456 --> 00:14:11.206 A:middle
creating a kind of informal,

00:14:11.206 --> 00:14:12.906 A:middle
comfortable feeling for the

00:14:13.536 --> 00:14:14.116 A:middle
children.

00:14:14.176 --> 00:14:15.856 A:middle
And if you're targeting your

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:17.326 A:middle
Swift Playground to a younger

00:14:17.326 --> 00:14:20.696 A:middle
audience as we were, using the

00:14:20.696 --> 00:14:22.316 A:middle
informal voice is going to be a

00:14:22.316 --> 00:14:23.996 A:middle
key piece in making this feel

00:14:24.046 --> 00:14:25.556 A:middle
comfortable to them, and like

00:14:25.556 --> 00:14:26.666 A:middle
something they're already used

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:28.346 A:middle
to reading with from school.

00:14:30.196 --> 00:14:31.376 A:middle
There's an important distinction

00:14:31.376 --> 00:14:32.756 A:middle
here to be made between the

00:14:32.756 --> 00:14:34.156 A:middle
formal and informal voice.

00:14:34.156 --> 00:14:36.926 A:middle
Because in iOS, for alerts or

00:14:36.926 --> 00:14:38.626 A:middle
other messages we actually use

00:14:38.626 --> 00:14:40.346 A:middle
the formal tone.

00:14:40.346 --> 00:14:41.796 A:middle
This is because it's more

00:14:41.796 --> 00:14:43.676 A:middle
appropriate when your phone or

00:14:43.676 --> 00:14:45.116 A:middle
computer is delivering you a

00:14:45.116 --> 00:14:47.326 A:middle
message in a matter-of-fact way,

00:14:47.816 --> 00:14:49.556 A:middle
to have a formal tone of voice.

00:14:50.206 --> 00:14:51.496 A:middle
And of course this contrasts

00:14:51.496 --> 00:14:52.546 A:middle
with Swift Playgrounds.

00:14:53.446 --> 00:14:55.316 A:middle
So this is an important factor

00:14:55.316 --> 00:14:56.596 A:middle
to consider, depending on the

00:14:56.596 --> 00:14:57.806 A:middle
age you're targeting.

00:14:58.616 --> 00:15:00.736 A:middle
Another part of your audience is

00:15:00.736 --> 00:15:02.026 A:middle
going to be how old they are.

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:04.356 A:middle
And Japanese gives us a good

00:15:04.686 --> 00:15:06.426 A:middle
example to understand this

00:15:06.426 --> 00:15:08.286 A:middle
distinction between older and

00:15:08.286 --> 00:15:09.126 A:middle
younger readers.

00:15:09.666 --> 00:15:11.736 A:middle
So Japanese uses three different

00:15:11.736 --> 00:15:12.966 A:middle
writing systems, and one of

00:15:12.966 --> 00:15:14.586 A:middle
those writing systems is called

00:15:14.586 --> 00:15:15.086 A:middle
Kan ji.

00:15:15.726 --> 00:15:17.536 A:middle
And Kan ji is a pictographical

00:15:17.536 --> 00:15:19.066 A:middle
alphabet that has thousands of

00:15:19.066 --> 00:15:19.716 A:middle
characters.

00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:22.566 A:middle
And the point here is that

00:15:22.776 --> 00:15:24.606 A:middle
children learn these characters

00:15:24.606 --> 00:15:26.006 A:middle
as they grow older, and a

00:15:26.006 --> 00:15:27.336 A:middle
younger person is going to be

00:15:27.386 --> 00:15:29.746 A:middle
familiar with less Kan ji than

00:15:29.746 --> 00:15:30.926 A:middle
an older person.

00:15:31.456 --> 00:15:32.426 A:middle
And they're going to be familiar

00:15:32.426 --> 00:15:34.046 A:middle
with simpler Kan ji rather than

00:15:34.046 --> 00:15:35.066 A:middle
more complex ones.

00:15:36.006 --> 00:15:37.876 A:middle
So how does this factor into

00:15:37.876 --> 00:15:38.856 A:middle
sort of playgrounds?

00:15:39.616 --> 00:15:40.756 A:middle
let's take the example of the

00:15:40.756 --> 00:15:43.046 A:middle
term, "Code area" which we use

00:15:43.046 --> 00:15:44.316 A:middle
to refer to the code editor

00:15:44.316 --> 00:15:45.616 A:middle
where you can input your Swift.

00:15:46.606 --> 00:15:48.356 A:middle
If you handed this off to a

00:15:48.356 --> 00:15:49.956 A:middle
translator without any prior

00:15:49.956 --> 00:15:52.256 A:middle
explanation, or instructions

00:15:52.256 --> 00:15:53.636 A:middle
about what age you're trying to

00:15:53.636 --> 00:15:55.126 A:middle
target, they might choose a

00:15:55.126 --> 00:15:56.796 A:middle
standard Japanese translation of

00:15:56.856 --> 00:15:58.186 A:middle
this, which sort of roughly

00:15:58.186 --> 00:15:59.616 A:middle
sounds like code sphere or

00:15:59.616 --> 00:16:00.216 A:middle
territory.

00:16:01.536 --> 00:16:04.076 A:middle
However, when you inform them

00:16:04.076 --> 00:16:05.446 A:middle
about these goals and the

00:16:05.486 --> 00:16:06.366 A:middle
younger audience that you're

00:16:06.366 --> 00:16:08.266 A:middle
targeting, a better translation

00:16:08.266 --> 00:16:09.666 A:middle
comes out, which is a place to

00:16:09.666 --> 00:16:10.256 A:middle
write code.

00:16:10.906 --> 00:16:11.656 A:middle
And there's a couple of

00:16:11.656 --> 00:16:12.736 A:middle
important points that I want to

00:16:12.736 --> 00:16:13.866 A:middle
highlight between these two

00:16:13.866 --> 00:16:14.666 A:middle
translations.

00:16:15.036 --> 00:16:16.166 A:middle
The first is the usage of the

00:16:16.166 --> 00:16:18.426 A:middle
word "place" versus "fear" or

00:16:18.426 --> 00:16:19.036 A:middle
"territory".

00:16:19.586 --> 00:16:22.836 A:middle
Place is a very common Kan ji,

00:16:23.106 --> 00:16:25.276 A:middle
and so a younger reader is much

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:26.526 A:middle
more likely to be able to -- to

00:16:26.526 --> 00:16:28.336 A:middle
be familiar with this -- with

00:16:28.336 --> 00:16:28.966 A:middle
these words.

00:16:29.696 --> 00:16:31.036 A:middle
Additionally, we also chose to

00:16:31.036 --> 00:16:32.386 A:middle
include the verb for, "to

00:16:32.386 --> 00:16:32.716 A:middle
write".

00:16:33.166 --> 00:16:34.776 A:middle
To really make it explicit what

00:16:34.776 --> 00:16:36.316 A:middle
the purpose of this area or

00:16:36.316 --> 00:16:37.276 A:middle
place is.

00:16:38.436 --> 00:16:39.906 A:middle
So that can go a long way in

00:16:39.906 --> 00:16:41.166 A:middle
making your Playgrounds easy to

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:41.726 A:middle
understand.

00:16:44.026 --> 00:16:45.716 A:middle
Technical terms are another area

00:16:45.716 --> 00:16:46.976 A:middle
where you should pay a lot of

00:16:46.976 --> 00:16:48.926 A:middle
attention when writing and

00:16:48.926 --> 00:16:49.806 A:middle
translating your Swift

00:16:49.806 --> 00:16:50.306 A:middle
Playgrounds.

00:16:50.816 --> 00:16:52.036 A:middle
So these can include computer

00:16:52.036 --> 00:16:54.296 A:middle
science terms, math terms, and

00:16:54.366 --> 00:16:57.866 A:middle
of course, the Swift language

00:16:57.866 --> 00:17:00.386 A:middle
keyword, enums, functions and

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:02.316 A:middle
other code that you include in

00:17:02.316 --> 00:17:03.016 A:middle
your prose.

00:17:04.126 --> 00:17:05.226 A:middle
And to understand this, let's

00:17:05.226 --> 00:17:06.776 A:middle
look at the example that Alex

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:08.246 A:middle
mentioned earlier about

00:17:08.246 --> 00:17:09.886 A:middle
introducing debugging.

00:17:10.586 --> 00:17:11.756 A:middle
And in order to introduce

00:17:11.756 --> 00:17:13.526 A:middle
debugging, we have to introduce

00:17:13.526 --> 00:17:14.796 A:middle
the concept of a bug.

00:17:16.246 --> 00:17:18.116 A:middle
And in English, we have a simple

00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:19.346 A:middle
phrase here that says, "A

00:17:19.346 --> 00:17:20.746 A:middle
mistake that keeps your program

00:17:20.816 --> 00:17:22.596 A:middle
from running correctly is called

00:17:22.596 --> 00:17:22.926 A:middle
a bug."

00:17:23.646 --> 00:17:24.856 A:middle
And the highlight here is on the

00:17:24.856 --> 00:17:26.656 A:middle
term bug, because that's what

00:17:26.656 --> 00:17:27.386 A:middle
we're going to take and

00:17:27.426 --> 00:17:28.756 A:middle
translate into our various

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:29.846 A:middle
languages.

00:17:30.476 --> 00:17:34.976 A:middle
So in French we discovered that

00:17:35.246 --> 00:17:36.756 A:middle
while learning programming in

00:17:36.756 --> 00:17:39.076 A:middle
French, the word bug is actually

00:17:39.076 --> 00:17:40.216 A:middle
left untranslated.

00:17:40.216 --> 00:17:42.306 A:middle
And that is the standard for

00:17:42.606 --> 00:17:44.676 A:middle
learning how to program.

00:17:45.256 --> 00:17:47.996 A:middle
So this is, you know, what feels

00:17:47.996 --> 00:17:49.526 A:middle
most natural and comfortable to

00:17:49.526 --> 00:17:50.686 A:middle
a speaker of French, and what's

00:17:50.686 --> 00:17:51.646 A:middle
most appropriate for the

00:17:51.646 --> 00:17:52.166 A:middle
context.

00:17:52.606 --> 00:17:53.956 A:middle
And so in this case, actually

00:17:54.196 --> 00:17:55.596 A:middle
not translating that word and

00:17:55.596 --> 00:17:57.416 A:middle
leaving it in English was the

00:17:57.416 --> 00:17:58.796 A:middle
most appropriate choice.

00:17:59.786 --> 00:18:01.556 A:middle
However, for a language like

00:18:01.556 --> 00:18:03.546 A:middle
Spanish, using a native term,

00:18:03.546 --> 00:18:07.086 A:middle
"error" was through our research

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.476 A:middle
and understanding, a more

00:18:08.476 --> 00:18:09.516 A:middle
appropriate choice here.

00:18:09.986 --> 00:18:11.176 A:middle
And an interesting fact about

00:18:11.176 --> 00:18:12.436 A:middle
the Spanish translation is that

00:18:12.436 --> 00:18:13.626 A:middle
in parentheses, we actually

00:18:13.626 --> 00:18:15.846 A:middle
point out that in English, the

00:18:15.846 --> 00:18:17.846 A:middle
word "error" is called, "bug".

00:18:18.426 --> 00:18:20.566 A:middle
And this allows the learner to

00:18:20.886 --> 00:18:22.476 A:middle
sort of see that term -- see the

00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:23.826 A:middle
term bug outside a Swift

00:18:23.826 --> 00:18:25.256 A:middle
Playground, perhaps, and

00:18:25.256 --> 00:18:26.556 A:middle
actually be able to relate it

00:18:26.556 --> 00:18:28.366 A:middle
back to what they learned in

00:18:28.516 --> 00:18:29.206 A:middle
Swift Playgrounds.

00:18:29.206 --> 00:18:32.676 A:middle
So that's terms that you

00:18:32.676 --> 00:18:34.346 A:middle
actually have a freedom to

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:34.906 A:middle
translate.

00:18:35.096 --> 00:18:36.266 A:middle
But what about terms that you

00:18:36.266 --> 00:18:37.546 A:middle
can't translate like code?

00:18:38.396 --> 00:18:40.016 A:middle
Here we have the example of the

00:18:40.016 --> 00:18:42.056 A:middle
function moveForward in the

00:18:42.056 --> 00:18:43.306 A:middle
Japanese version of Swift

00:18:43.306 --> 00:18:43.926 A:middle
Playgrounds.

00:18:44.266 --> 00:18:45.956 A:middle
And we needed to mention this

00:18:45.956 --> 00:18:48.076 A:middle
function in the prose to sort of

00:18:48.076 --> 00:18:49.516 A:middle
explain certain concepts.

00:18:50.066 --> 00:18:51.576 A:middle
And Japanese is an interesting

00:18:51.576 --> 00:18:52.536 A:middle
language because it has a

00:18:52.536 --> 00:18:54.116 A:middle
relatively low tolerance for

00:18:54.116 --> 00:18:55.536 A:middle
English words being introduced

00:18:55.536 --> 00:18:56.326 A:middle
into the language.

00:18:57.156 --> 00:18:59.996 A:middle
So it's important that we call

00:18:59.996 --> 00:19:02.876 A:middle
out the simple explanation for

00:19:02.876 --> 00:19:04.986 A:middle
this function moveForward, or

00:19:05.126 --> 00:19:07.416 A:middle
susumo or move in Japanese, in

00:19:07.416 --> 00:19:09.466 A:middle
parentheses following the

00:19:09.466 --> 00:19:10.556 A:middle
occurrence of the function name.

00:19:10.556 --> 00:19:11.936 A:middle
And this really helps the

00:19:11.936 --> 00:19:14.526 A:middle
learner draw a parallel between

00:19:14.526 --> 00:19:15.516 A:middle
the English term and the

00:19:15.516 --> 00:19:17.106 A:middle
Japanese term so that they can

00:19:17.306 --> 00:19:18.816 A:middle
sort of internalize the meaning

00:19:18.816 --> 00:19:19.146 A:middle
of it.

00:19:20.036 --> 00:19:21.306 A:middle
And another interesting thing

00:19:21.306 --> 00:19:22.936 A:middle
about Japanese is because of

00:19:22.936 --> 00:19:25.426 A:middle
this familiarity with English,

00:19:25.716 --> 00:19:26.996 A:middle
or lack of familiarity with

00:19:26.996 --> 00:19:28.956 A:middle
English, we make it a point to

00:19:28.956 --> 00:19:30.846 A:middle
mention these parenthesized

00:19:30.846 --> 00:19:32.356 A:middle
explanations for function names

00:19:32.356 --> 00:19:35.446 A:middle
and other variables throughout

00:19:35.726 --> 00:19:37.886 A:middle
the entire prose instead of

00:19:37.916 --> 00:19:39.396 A:middle
mentioning them when the term is

00:19:39.396 --> 00:19:41.186 A:middle
introduced and then phasing them

00:19:41.186 --> 00:19:41.426 A:middle
out.

00:19:42.106 --> 00:19:43.526 A:middle
And that's a strategy that

00:19:43.676 --> 00:19:45.056 A:middle
varies per language because

00:19:45.056 --> 00:19:47.196 A:middle
different language are familiar

00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:48.236 A:middle
differently with English.

00:19:49.296 --> 00:19:50.486 A:middle
So it's another important thing

00:19:50.486 --> 00:19:51.006 A:middle
to consider.

00:19:53.376 --> 00:19:54.526 A:middle
Your translators will also have

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:55.976 A:middle
a lot of editorial freedom when

00:19:55.976 --> 00:19:57.396 A:middle
translating Swift Playgrounds.

00:19:57.926 --> 00:20:00.686 A:middle
So here we are introducing and

00:20:00.686 --> 00:20:03.366 A:middle
learn to code three, the concept

00:20:03.366 --> 00:20:05.226 A:middle
of a quadrant and the fact that

00:20:05.286 --> 00:20:07.056 A:middle
the learner can place different

00:20:07.056 --> 00:20:08.106 A:middle
objects at a different

00:20:08.106 --> 00:20:09.466 A:middle
coordinate in the space.

00:20:10.276 --> 00:20:11.276 A:middle
And to do this, of course we

00:20:11.276 --> 00:20:12.316 A:middle
need to talk about the term

00:20:12.316 --> 00:20:12.826 A:middle
quadrant.

00:20:14.066 --> 00:20:15.766 A:middle
So in English, we introduce the

00:20:15.766 --> 00:20:17.486 A:middle
term quadrant by relating it to

00:20:17.566 --> 00:20:18.246 A:middle
quarters.

00:20:18.636 --> 00:20:20.006 A:middle
And there is a nice alliteration

00:20:20.006 --> 00:20:22.666 A:middle
here, and that makes it a little

00:20:22.666 --> 00:20:24.596 A:middle
bit easier for the term to get

00:20:24.596 --> 00:20:25.246 A:middle
introduced.

00:20:26.076 --> 00:20:27.446 A:middle
However, in Japanese we don't

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:29.996 A:middle
have the advantage of having

00:20:29.996 --> 00:20:31.176 A:middle
this alliteration.

00:20:31.486 --> 00:20:32.726 A:middle
And so the translator here

00:20:32.726 --> 00:20:35.306 A:middle
adopted a different strategy to

00:20:35.306 --> 00:20:37.806 A:middle
use a simple word for area or

00:20:38.526 --> 00:20:39.796 A:middle
[inaudible] outside parentheses.

00:20:40.096 --> 00:20:42.036 A:middle
And then inside parentheses, use

00:20:42.036 --> 00:20:43.606 A:middle
the more technical; complicated

00:20:43.606 --> 00:20:46.776 A:middle
term or shogan for quadrant.

00:20:46.776 --> 00:20:49.076 A:middle
The English translations there

00:20:49.076 --> 00:20:50.606 A:middle
are for your reference below.

00:20:51.566 --> 00:20:52.606 A:middle
So the translator -- an

00:20:52.606 --> 00:20:53.976 A:middle
important thing to note here is

00:20:53.976 --> 00:20:55.176 A:middle
that the translator didn't stick

00:20:55.176 --> 00:20:57.336 A:middle
verbatim to what was in English.

00:20:57.846 --> 00:20:59.536 A:middle
Which might be the default case

00:20:59.536 --> 00:21:00.626 A:middle
if you didn't give them any

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:01.216 A:middle
instructions.

00:21:01.216 --> 00:21:02.756 A:middle
They might try to stick very

00:21:02.756 --> 00:21:04.076 A:middle
closely to the English text.

00:21:04.906 --> 00:21:06.266 A:middle
So it's important to let them

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:08.036 A:middle
know that they have the freedom

00:21:08.296 --> 00:21:09.776 A:middle
to do what is most appropriate

00:21:10.106 --> 00:21:11.606 A:middle
and most comfortable for their

00:21:11.606 --> 00:21:12.236 A:middle
own language.

00:21:13.616 --> 00:21:16.076 A:middle
Additionally, because Swift

00:21:16.076 --> 00:21:17.726 A:middle
Playgrounds prose is written in

00:21:17.726 --> 00:21:19.376 A:middle
a variant of Markdown, they

00:21:19.376 --> 00:21:20.836 A:middle
actually have the freedom to add

00:21:21.386 --> 00:21:23.726 A:middle
extra formatting, bold or

00:21:23.726 --> 00:21:25.466 A:middle
italic, or even extra glossary

00:21:25.466 --> 00:21:27.056 A:middle
links to their particular

00:21:27.056 --> 00:21:28.986 A:middle
language if they deem that to be

00:21:29.086 --> 00:21:29.716 A:middle
appropriate.

00:21:32.886 --> 00:21:34.226 A:middle
So when thinking about technical

00:21:34.226 --> 00:21:35.396 A:middle
terms, it's important to keep in

00:21:35.396 --> 00:21:37.526 A:middle
mind that unfamiliar terms are

00:21:37.526 --> 00:21:39.356 A:middle
confusing, and you should be

00:21:39.356 --> 00:21:40.906 A:middle
aware of that when using them in

00:21:40.906 --> 00:21:42.666 A:middle
your prose.

00:21:42.666 --> 00:21:43.656 A:middle
Different languages have

00:21:43.656 --> 00:21:44.926 A:middle
different levels of comfort with

00:21:44.926 --> 00:21:45.346 A:middle
English.

00:21:45.826 --> 00:21:47.486 A:middle
So what works for one language

00:21:47.616 --> 00:21:48.906 A:middle
will not always work for

00:21:48.906 --> 00:21:49.246 A:middle
another.

00:21:50.656 --> 00:21:52.196 A:middle
And lastly, consistency is

00:21:52.196 --> 00:21:53.506 A:middle
really, really important here.

00:21:54.036 --> 00:21:55.566 A:middle
Especially because we're dealing

00:21:55.566 --> 00:21:56.616 A:middle
with terms that might be from a

00:21:56.616 --> 00:21:57.896 A:middle
foreign language or might be

00:21:57.896 --> 00:21:58.876 A:middle
highly technical.

00:21:59.186 --> 00:22:00.456 A:middle
It's important to maintain a

00:22:00.696 --> 00:22:02.746 A:middle
consistent usage of those terms

00:22:02.746 --> 00:22:04.476 A:middle
throughout your prose so that a

00:22:04.536 --> 00:22:06.026 A:middle
person can get more familiar

00:22:06.686 --> 00:22:08.126 A:middle
with them.

00:22:09.316 --> 00:22:11.816 A:middle
So we looked at a lot of

00:22:12.306 --> 00:22:13.376 A:middle
examples of different

00:22:13.906 --> 00:22:15.626 A:middle
localization strategies and

00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:17.136 A:middle
different localization pitfalls

00:22:17.136 --> 00:22:18.076 A:middle
and Swift Playgrounds, and

00:22:18.076 --> 00:22:19.126 A:middle
there's a few things that I want

00:22:19.126 --> 00:22:20.206 A:middle
you to take away from this.

00:22:21.576 --> 00:22:23.496 A:middle
Firstly, your content goals and

00:22:23.496 --> 00:22:24.756 A:middle
your audience are really going

00:22:24.756 --> 00:22:26.066 A:middle
to influence your localization

00:22:26.066 --> 00:22:27.856 A:middle
here, perhaps even more so than

00:22:27.856 --> 00:22:30.166 A:middle
a standard iOS application.

00:22:30.416 --> 00:22:32.406 A:middle
So it's really important to plan

00:22:32.406 --> 00:22:33.916 A:middle
those out with localization in

00:22:33.916 --> 00:22:34.956 A:middle
mind beforehand.

00:22:36.356 --> 00:22:37.376 A:middle
Different languages have

00:22:37.376 --> 00:22:39.356 A:middle
different language features, and

00:22:40.136 --> 00:22:41.366 A:middle
your translators are going to

00:22:41.366 --> 00:22:43.626 A:middle
need to have the freedom to do

00:22:43.626 --> 00:22:45.446 A:middle
what's most appropriate for

00:22:45.446 --> 00:22:46.666 A:middle
their particular language.

00:22:48.756 --> 00:22:49.996 A:middle
Maintaining a style guide or

00:22:49.996 --> 00:22:52.046 A:middle
some kind of document for your

00:22:52.146 --> 00:22:53.596 A:middle
translation process is going to

00:22:53.596 --> 00:22:55.026 A:middle
be really helpful for you here.

00:22:55.446 --> 00:22:58.076 A:middle
Both in, you know, explaining to

00:22:58.076 --> 00:23:00.326 A:middle
your translators how -- what

00:23:00.326 --> 00:23:01.266 A:middle
your goals are; what your

00:23:01.266 --> 00:23:02.796 A:middle
content goals are and how you

00:23:02.796 --> 00:23:04.306 A:middle
want the translations to sound

00:23:04.306 --> 00:23:05.966 A:middle
and feel, as well as any

00:23:05.966 --> 00:23:07.226 A:middle
language-specific issues that

00:23:07.226 --> 00:23:08.176 A:middle
they may encounter and

00:23:08.176 --> 00:23:09.596 A:middle
strategies they want to -- may

00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:11.136 A:middle
want to develop to maintain

00:23:11.136 --> 00:23:12.696 A:middle
consistency throughout your

00:23:12.996 --> 00:23:13.796 A:middle
translations.

00:23:14.186 --> 00:23:17.566 A:middle
And user testing is really your

00:23:17.566 --> 00:23:18.186 A:middle
friend here.

00:23:18.496 --> 00:23:20.616 A:middle
It might be resource intensive

00:23:20.616 --> 00:23:22.136 A:middle
and difficult to find people

00:23:22.136 --> 00:23:23.206 A:middle
that you are targeting with your

00:23:23.206 --> 00:23:24.806 A:middle
playgrounds, but the effort

00:23:24.806 --> 00:23:26.236 A:middle
really, really pays off here.

00:23:26.516 --> 00:23:28.356 A:middle
Because your users of your

00:23:28.356 --> 00:23:29.876 A:middle
target are the audience are the

00:23:29.876 --> 00:23:31.146 A:middle
only people who can really tell

00:23:31.146 --> 00:23:32.976 A:middle
you how effective your

00:23:32.976 --> 00:23:34.426 A:middle
playground is being at teaching

00:23:34.426 --> 00:23:35.826 A:middle
them these concepts.

00:23:37.736 --> 00:23:40.186 A:middle
So lastly, I'd like to bring you

00:23:40.186 --> 00:23:43.186 A:middle
back to this picture of

00:23:43.186 --> 00:23:44.736 A:middle
localization and kind of the

00:23:44.736 --> 00:23:46.986 A:middle
holistic idea here where your

00:23:46.986 --> 00:23:48.916 A:middle
goals -- your original goals and

00:23:48.916 --> 00:23:50.326 A:middle
the localized content are not

00:23:50.326 --> 00:23:52.016 A:middle
really separate entities that

00:23:52.096 --> 00:23:53.526 A:middle
feedback into each other and

00:23:53.526 --> 00:23:54.926 A:middle
really influence each others

00:23:54.926 --> 00:23:55.526 A:middle
development.

00:23:56.056 --> 00:23:57.866 A:middle
It's really important to keep

00:23:57.866 --> 00:23:59.856 A:middle
this in mind when you're taking

00:23:59.856 --> 00:24:01.586 A:middle
your content from English or

00:24:01.586 --> 00:24:03.416 A:middle
whatever you're -- the language

00:24:03.416 --> 00:24:05.456 A:middle
that you wrote it in is into

00:24:05.636 --> 00:24:07.736 A:middle
translated Playgrounds.

00:24:08.216 --> 00:24:10.306 A:middle
Because localization is so often

00:24:10.306 --> 00:24:12.296 A:middle
overlooked as a part of software

00:24:12.296 --> 00:24:14.566 A:middle
development, you have no idea

00:24:14.566 --> 00:24:16.966 A:middle
how much users really appreciate

00:24:16.966 --> 00:24:18.866 A:middle
a well-localized, well-thought

00:24:18.866 --> 00:24:19.546 A:middle
out product.

00:24:20.046 --> 00:24:21.566 A:middle
And I'm confident that if you

00:24:21.696 --> 00:24:23.156 A:middle
try to follow these guidelines

00:24:23.156 --> 00:24:24.216 A:middle
and stick to what we talked

00:24:24.216 --> 00:24:25.956 A:middle
about here, you'll really be

00:24:25.956 --> 00:24:27.136 A:middle
able to give people an amazing

00:24:27.136 --> 00:24:28.266 A:middle
experience in their native

00:24:28.266 --> 00:24:28.696 A:middle
language.

00:24:29.466 --> 00:24:31.506 A:middle
So with that I'll hand it back

00:24:31.506 --> 00:24:33.846 A:middle
to Alex, and he'll take you

00:24:33.846 --> 00:24:35.656 A:middle
through the process of actually

00:24:35.656 --> 00:24:37.046 A:middle
localizing your Playground book.

00:24:37.576 --> 00:24:37.886 A:middle
Thank you.

00:24:38.516 --> 00:24:44.416 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:45.556 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Aaltan.

00:24:46.356 --> 00:24:47.566 A:middle
So now we're going to dive into

00:24:47.566 --> 00:24:49.076 A:middle
some of the technical details to

00:24:49.076 --> 00:24:50.436 A:middle
make your book localizable.

00:24:50.786 --> 00:24:52.496 A:middle
And along with this talk there's

00:24:52.496 --> 00:24:54.346 A:middle
also sample code which you can

00:24:54.346 --> 00:24:55.536 A:middle
explore in detail all of the

00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:56.636 A:middle
things we're talking about

00:24:56.756 --> 00:24:57.076 A:middle
today.

00:24:57.676 --> 00:25:00.706 A:middle
Now, this is a page in "Learn to

00:25:00.706 --> 00:25:01.966 A:middle
Code" that's expanded out to

00:25:01.966 --> 00:25:03.416 A:middle
show off all the different areas

00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:04.376 A:middle
that you have to worry about

00:25:04.376 --> 00:25:05.366 A:middle
when you localize.

00:25:06.446 --> 00:25:07.766 A:middle
So on the right you'll see the

00:25:07.766 --> 00:25:09.126 A:middle
live view, but you can have

00:25:09.126 --> 00:25:10.556 A:middle
strings presented to the user.

00:25:10.916 --> 00:25:12.646 A:middle
In this case the audio controls.

00:25:14.236 --> 00:25:15.956 A:middle
There's also prose providing

00:25:15.956 --> 00:25:17.156 A:middle
instructional text.

00:25:18.336 --> 00:25:21.706 A:middle
The editable code area which is

00:25:21.706 --> 00:25:22.916 A:middle
a text that is displayed to the

00:25:22.916 --> 00:25:24.666 A:middle
user before they begin writing

00:25:24.666 --> 00:25:27.696 A:middle
codes to provide a prompt.

00:25:27.826 --> 00:25:28.936 A:middle
Each page can have a title.

00:25:30.456 --> 00:25:31.916 A:middle
Then also different glossary

00:25:31.916 --> 00:25:33.726 A:middle
terms which have definitions for

00:25:33.726 --> 00:25:34.866 A:middle
the learner to learn more about

00:25:34.866 --> 00:25:35.906 A:middle
if they forgot a term.

00:25:36.476 --> 00:25:39.266 A:middle
And a page can have one or more

00:25:39.266 --> 00:25:40.816 A:middle
hints if you want to provide

00:25:40.816 --> 00:25:42.316 A:middle
help for your learner as they're

00:25:42.316 --> 00:25:44.336 A:middle
going through and learning a

00:25:46.536 --> 00:25:46.766 A:middle
concept.

00:25:46.846 --> 00:25:48.376 A:middle
So these are all the different

00:25:48.376 --> 00:25:49.876 A:middle
parts we'll talk about showing

00:25:49.876 --> 00:25:51.416 A:middle
how to localize and what you

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:53.246 A:middle
need to do for each of them.

00:25:53.246 --> 00:25:54.256 A:middle
And these come in a few

00:25:54.256 --> 00:25:56.126 A:middle
different types of files for

00:25:56.126 --> 00:25:56.956 A:middle
Playgrounds.

00:25:57.296 --> 00:25:58.376 A:middle
You might use a string in a

00:25:58.376 --> 00:26:00.276 A:middle
stringsdict file as well as an

00:26:00.276 --> 00:26:01.326 A:middle
xml plist.

00:26:01.846 --> 00:26:03.846 A:middle
And the cut scenes are written

00:26:03.846 --> 00:26:04.606 A:middle
in html.

00:26:05.236 --> 00:26:06.656 A:middle
And you may also have localized

00:26:06.656 --> 00:26:07.226 A:middle
assets.

00:26:07.496 --> 00:26:08.486 A:middle
So just do a change in each

00:26:08.486 --> 00:26:10.546 A:middle
image for each language to adapt

00:26:11.076 --> 00:26:11.146 A:middle
it.

00:26:12.436 --> 00:26:13.926 A:middle
Now one other detail before we

00:26:13.926 --> 00:26:15.606 A:middle
begin diving into the details is

00:26:15.606 --> 00:26:16.866 A:middle
understanding the overall

00:26:16.866 --> 00:26:18.806 A:middle
structure of a playground book.

00:26:19.336 --> 00:26:21.336 A:middle
So at a base level here, you see

00:26:21.336 --> 00:26:22.766 A:middle
you have a sources directory and

00:26:22.766 --> 00:26:24.226 A:middle
a private resources directory.

00:26:24.836 --> 00:26:26.166 A:middle
And the thing to note here is

00:26:26.166 --> 00:26:27.326 A:middle
that in the private resources

00:26:27.326 --> 00:26:29.216 A:middle
directory, you'll have an lproj

00:26:29.416 --> 00:26:30.156 A:middle
for each language you're

00:26:30.156 --> 00:26:30.666 A:middle
supporting.

00:26:31.216 --> 00:26:32.266 A:middle
In this example we're doing

00:26:32.266 --> 00:26:33.706 A:middle
English and Spanish, with

00:26:33.706 --> 00:26:35.106 A:middle
English being our development

00:26:35.106 --> 00:26:35.536 A:middle
language.

00:26:36.716 --> 00:26:39.086 A:middle
Then there is one or more

00:26:39.206 --> 00:26:41.016 A:middle
chapters in each book.

00:26:41.476 --> 00:26:43.986 A:middle
And each chapter has one or more

00:26:43.986 --> 00:26:44.466 A:middle
pages.

00:26:44.846 --> 00:26:46.096 A:middle
And this is an example in one of

00:26:46.096 --> 00:26:47.616 A:middle
the pages in a book.

00:26:48.116 --> 00:26:49.236 A:middle
And again, the thing to note

00:26:49.236 --> 00:26:50.556 A:middle
here is that the private

00:26:50.556 --> 00:26:52.156 A:middle
resource directory has those

00:26:52.156 --> 00:26:53.876 A:middle
same lproj's for each language

00:26:53.876 --> 00:26:54.536 A:middle
you are supporting.

00:26:55.646 --> 00:26:57.446 A:middle
So what does this look like for

00:26:57.446 --> 00:26:58.126 A:middle
each of the things?

00:26:58.306 --> 00:27:00.166 A:middle
Well, the strings that you have

00:27:00.166 --> 00:27:01.996 A:middle
in the live view, these you

00:27:01.996 --> 00:27:03.616 A:middle
should use in this localized

00:27:03.616 --> 00:27:05.426 A:middle
string for any time you are

00:27:05.836 --> 00:27:06.846 A:middle
using a string that will be

00:27:06.846 --> 00:27:07.946 A:middle
presented to the user.

00:27:08.736 --> 00:27:10.836 A:middle
And a thing to note here is that

00:27:10.836 --> 00:27:12.316 A:middle
it's not just things that

00:27:12.316 --> 00:27:13.376 A:middle
visually appear in the Live

00:27:13.376 --> 00:27:15.036 A:middle
View, but this also is important

00:27:15.036 --> 00:27:16.016 A:middle
for accessibility.

00:27:16.506 --> 00:27:18.046 A:middle
All of your accessibility labels

00:27:18.046 --> 00:27:20.336 A:middle
should use NSLocalizedString, so

00:27:20.336 --> 00:27:21.806 A:middle
that when someone is using the

00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:23.026 A:middle
accessibility features in

00:27:23.026 --> 00:27:24.796 A:middle
another language, they can get

00:27:24.796 --> 00:27:26.466 A:middle
the proper voiceover in their

00:27:26.466 --> 00:27:27.456 A:middle
language and have a great

00:27:27.456 --> 00:27:28.646 A:middle
experience with your content.

00:27:29.246 --> 00:27:32.196 A:middle
Now once you use

00:27:32.196 --> 00:27:33.856 A:middle
NSLocalizedString you would

00:27:33.856 --> 00:27:35.326 A:middle
extract this into the strings

00:27:35.326 --> 00:27:36.766 A:middle
file with a tool we made called

00:27:36.766 --> 00:27:37.376 A:middle
genstrings.

00:27:37.376 --> 00:27:39.576 A:middle
And there's more information on

00:27:39.576 --> 00:27:41.016 A:middle
the developers site of how to

00:27:41.016 --> 00:27:42.986 A:middle
use this tool and extract it.

00:27:44.806 --> 00:27:46.516 A:middle
And there was also a talk

00:27:46.856 --> 00:27:48.156 A:middle
earlier this week on localizing

00:27:48.156 --> 00:27:49.766 A:middle
with Xcode 9 that goes through a

00:27:49.766 --> 00:27:51.346 A:middle
lot of general best practices

00:27:51.346 --> 00:27:54.306 A:middle
with localizing in Xcode.

00:27:54.706 --> 00:27:56.396 A:middle
Now one key thing to note that

00:27:56.396 --> 00:27:57.626 A:middle
you might do in your playground

00:27:58.066 --> 00:28:00.386 A:middle
is using an image with text.

00:28:00.566 --> 00:28:02.526 A:middle
And it's really critical here to

00:28:02.526 --> 00:28:04.256 A:middle
not hardcode the text into the

00:28:04.256 --> 00:28:06.126 A:middle
image, as this will make it very

00:28:06.126 --> 00:28:07.846 A:middle
difficult to localize, requiring

00:28:07.846 --> 00:28:09.636 A:middle
you to remake the image for each

00:28:09.636 --> 00:28:10.176 A:middle
language.

00:28:10.746 --> 00:28:12.406 A:middle
Instead, you can layer the text

00:28:12.406 --> 00:28:14.566 A:middle
on top of it to enable the

00:28:14.566 --> 00:28:16.146 A:middle
translator just to translate the

00:28:16.146 --> 00:28:17.956 A:middle
strings and take advantage of

00:28:17.956 --> 00:28:19.716 A:middle
all of iOS's layout capabilities

00:28:19.746 --> 00:28:21.716 A:middle
to have a great experience for

00:28:23.956 --> 00:28:24.366 A:middle
the learner.

00:28:24.366 --> 00:28:26.396 A:middle
Now once you have these files,

00:28:26.396 --> 00:28:27.366 A:middle
the string file will get

00:28:27.366 --> 00:28:29.256 A:middle
extracted into the base level

00:28:29.506 --> 00:28:30.906 A:middle
private resources folder in the

00:28:30.906 --> 00:28:31.336 A:middle
project.

00:28:32.446 --> 00:28:33.986 A:middle
And optionally for using a

00:28:33.986 --> 00:28:35.846 A:middle
stringsdict file to dynamically

00:28:35.846 --> 00:28:37.226 A:middle
reference a number, such as how

00:28:37.226 --> 00:28:38.336 A:middle
many lines of code the learner

00:28:38.336 --> 00:28:39.766 A:middle
has written, you would create a

00:28:39.766 --> 00:28:41.106 A:middle
stringsdict file for that as

00:28:41.106 --> 00:28:42.236 A:middle
well in the same directory.

00:28:43.466 --> 00:28:47.206 A:middle
So the next piece is the prose.

00:28:48.066 --> 00:28:50.206 A:middle
And this is rendered in markups

00:28:50.466 --> 00:28:51.536 A:middle
to the form of markdown.

00:28:52.536 --> 00:28:53.716 A:middle
And this enables page level

00:28:53.716 --> 00:28:54.306 A:middle
formatting.

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:56.766 A:middle
You can do bolding, italics, you

00:28:56.766 --> 00:28:58.946 A:middle
can create glossary terms or

00:28:58.946 --> 00:29:00.116 A:middle
link to another page in the

00:29:00.116 --> 00:29:00.416 A:middle
book.

00:29:01.086 --> 00:29:03.106 A:middle
And because of this, you have

00:29:03.106 --> 00:29:04.406 A:middle
this different markup format

00:29:04.466 --> 00:29:05.506 A:middle
that your translators will need

00:29:05.506 --> 00:29:07.046 A:middle
to be aware of to take advantage

00:29:07.046 --> 00:29:07.236 A:middle
of.

00:29:07.766 --> 00:29:09.826 A:middle
So as Aaltan said, you want to

00:29:09.826 --> 00:29:11.046 A:middle
tell all of your translators to

00:29:11.046 --> 00:29:13.606 A:middle
have editorial freedom to adjust

00:29:13.606 --> 00:29:15.316 A:middle
maybe the bolding or the style

00:29:15.426 --> 00:29:16.326 A:middle
per language.

00:29:16.756 --> 00:29:17.576 A:middle
And so they really need to

00:29:17.576 --> 00:29:19.206 A:middle
understand the format in order

00:29:19.206 --> 00:29:20.196 A:middle
to be able to do so.

00:29:21.196 --> 00:29:22.856 A:middle
And it's also important that

00:29:22.856 --> 00:29:24.406 A:middle
they be aware of what terms

00:29:24.406 --> 00:29:26.186 A:middle
cannot be translated that are

00:29:26.186 --> 00:29:28.066 A:middle
actually part of the format so

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:29.146 A:middle
that they don't accidentally

00:29:29.146 --> 00:29:30.496 A:middle
introduce errors in the code

00:29:30.766 --> 00:29:31.896 A:middle
when they go to localize it.

00:29:32.996 --> 00:29:35.816 A:middle
now how do you make your prose

00:29:35.816 --> 00:29:36.446 A:middle
localizable?

00:29:36.876 --> 00:29:39.116 A:middle
Well, you start a prose block by

00:29:39.116 --> 00:29:40.416 A:middle
this little opening comment

00:29:40.416 --> 00:29:42.336 A:middle
here, and then you add a

00:29:42.336 --> 00:29:43.436 A:middle
localized key.

00:29:43.636 --> 00:29:44.566 A:middle
In this case we're calling it

00:29:44.566 --> 00:29:46.096 A:middle
firstproseblock as a name for

00:29:46.096 --> 00:29:46.556 A:middle
this key.

00:29:46.916 --> 00:29:48.056 A:middle
This will enable it to be

00:29:48.056 --> 00:29:48.666 A:middle
localized.

00:29:50.056 --> 00:29:51.686 A:middle
And then in your lproj you'll

00:29:51.686 --> 00:29:53.656 A:middle
create a prose.strings file and

00:29:53.856 --> 00:29:56.376 A:middle
put that same key there and then

00:29:56.646 --> 00:29:57.996 A:middle
set the value for whatever the

00:29:57.996 --> 00:29:58.826 A:middle
markup that should be

00:29:58.826 --> 00:29:59.896 A:middle
substituted in for that

00:29:59.896 --> 00:30:00.596 A:middle
language.

00:30:01.116 --> 00:30:05.856 A:middle
And the contents.swift resides

00:30:05.856 --> 00:30:07.016 A:middle
at the base directory for each

00:30:07.016 --> 00:30:07.566 A:middle
page.

00:30:08.026 --> 00:30:10.076 A:middle
But the prose.strings file will

00:30:10.076 --> 00:30:12.056 A:middle
be in the private resources for

00:30:12.056 --> 00:30:12.666 A:middle
each language that you're

00:30:12.666 --> 00:30:12.956 A:middle
supporting.

00:30:18.866 --> 00:30:20.626 A:middle
Next is the editable text field

00:30:20.626 --> 00:30:21.406 A:middle
placeholders.

00:30:21.946 --> 00:30:24.046 A:middle
So these are another strings

00:30:24.046 --> 00:30:24.456 A:middle
file.

00:30:24.456 --> 00:30:25.846 A:middle
And you see here the tap to

00:30:25.846 --> 00:30:26.506 A:middle
tenter code.

00:30:27.476 --> 00:30:28.726 A:middle
So how this is defined in the

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:30.376 A:middle
initial language is just in a

00:30:30.376 --> 00:30:31.176 A:middle
code comment.

00:30:31.666 --> 00:30:32.576 A:middle
Where you see in the

00:30:32.576 --> 00:30:34.166 A:middle
contents.swift tap to enter

00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:34.516 A:middle
code.

00:30:35.086 --> 00:30:38.086 A:middle
And for this to be localizable,

00:30:38.376 --> 00:30:39.286 A:middle
you'll create an editable

00:30:39.286 --> 00:30:41.936 A:middle
field.strings file using the key

00:30:42.216 --> 00:30:43.666 A:middle
being the initial phrase you

00:30:43.666 --> 00:30:45.526 A:middle
created in your contents.swift.

00:30:46.016 --> 00:30:48.066 A:middle
So again, tap to enter code, but

00:30:48.066 --> 00:30:49.326 A:middle
you put in the appropriate

00:30:49.326 --> 00:30:50.606 A:middle
translation for each other

00:30:50.606 --> 00:30:51.636 A:middle
language you're supporting.

00:30:52.106 --> 00:30:56.036 A:middle
And this is done at the base

00:30:56.036 --> 00:30:57.766 A:middle
directory of the Playground book

00:30:57.766 --> 00:30:59.306 A:middle
in the private resources for the

00:30:59.306 --> 00:31:00.806 A:middle
associated languages.

00:31:01.306 --> 00:31:05.266 A:middle
Next up is a page and chapter

00:31:05.266 --> 00:31:05.766 A:middle
titles.

00:31:06.806 --> 00:31:09.046 A:middle
And so here there is a manifest

00:31:09.046 --> 00:31:10.526 A:middle
plist.strings file that you'll

00:31:10.526 --> 00:31:12.166 A:middle
need to create for each page or

00:31:12.166 --> 00:31:14.866 A:middle
chapter, and in this the app is

00:31:14.866 --> 00:31:16.846 A:middle
looking for the key name to

00:31:16.846 --> 00:31:18.626 A:middle
substitute in the new name for

00:31:18.626 --> 00:31:20.506 A:middle
the localized title for your

00:31:20.506 --> 00:31:20.836 A:middle
book.

00:31:21.266 --> 00:31:26.246 A:middle
And this is put in, again, the

00:31:26.246 --> 00:31:28.176 A:middle
private resources for that

00:31:28.176 --> 00:31:29.866 A:middle
particular page for each

00:31:29.866 --> 00:31:30.796 A:middle
language project.

00:31:32.516 --> 00:31:35.016 A:middle
So next up is the glossary.

00:31:35.016 --> 00:31:36.696 A:middle
And this is changing the format

00:31:36.696 --> 00:31:37.976 A:middle
as it's using XML.

00:31:38.366 --> 00:31:39.666 A:middle
And you'll need to make a copy

00:31:39.666 --> 00:31:40.596 A:middle
for this for each language

00:31:40.596 --> 00:31:41.276 A:middle
you're supporting.

00:31:41.906 --> 00:31:43.566 A:middle
But here is an example of the

00:31:43.566 --> 00:31:44.606 A:middle
English glossary.

00:31:45.456 --> 00:31:46.476 A:middle
And we're looking at what the

00:31:46.476 --> 00:31:48.666 A:middle
command definition is in

00:31:48.666 --> 00:31:49.156 A:middle
English.

00:31:50.026 --> 00:31:52.256 A:middle
So one thing to note here is

00:31:52.256 --> 00:31:54.166 A:middle
that the top level key command

00:31:54.636 --> 00:31:56.246 A:middle
is going to be the same across

00:31:56.246 --> 00:31:57.136 A:middle
every language.

00:31:57.626 --> 00:31:58.546 A:middle
This will be how the [applause]

00:31:58.546 --> 00:32:00.166 A:middle
looks up the glossary definition

00:32:00.166 --> 00:32:01.646 A:middle
and will not change.

00:32:02.746 --> 00:32:04.816 A:middle
Similarly, the page reference

00:32:05.076 --> 00:32:07.046 A:middle
should use a -- be by file

00:32:07.046 --> 00:32:08.776 A:middle
reference and not be page

00:32:08.776 --> 00:32:10.576 A:middle
referencing the title, which can

00:32:10.576 --> 00:32:11.416 A:middle
cause it to break in

00:32:11.416 --> 00:32:12.796 A:middle
localization if you were to

00:32:12.796 --> 00:32:13.576 A:middle
change the title.

00:32:14.116 --> 00:32:17.236 A:middle
And then there are several

00:32:17.236 --> 00:32:18.436 A:middle
different strings that you will

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:19.926 A:middle
send off to your translator to

00:32:19.926 --> 00:32:21.656 A:middle
localize that you see here.

00:32:22.576 --> 00:32:24.216 A:middle
So if this is put into Spanish,

00:32:25.096 --> 00:32:26.696 A:middle
you then see the -- that overall

00:32:26.696 --> 00:32:28.016 A:middle
everything is the same, except

00:32:28.016 --> 00:32:29.666 A:middle
for those three strings get

00:32:29.666 --> 00:32:31.476 A:middle
localized and will be displayed

00:32:31.476 --> 00:32:33.426 A:middle
appropriately when the user runs

00:32:33.736 --> 00:32:35.346 A:middle
the app in Spanish.

00:32:35.866 --> 00:32:38.966 A:middle
And this glossary is stored at

00:32:38.966 --> 00:32:40.656 A:middle
the base-level private resources

00:32:40.946 --> 00:32:41.636 A:middle
in the project.

00:32:41.696 --> 00:32:43.506 A:middle
So you'd have one in your

00:32:43.506 --> 00:32:45.996 A:middle
English lproj, and then also a

00:32:45.996 --> 00:32:47.886 A:middle
copy that's been translated for

00:32:47.886 --> 00:32:48.766 A:middle
your Spanish project.

00:32:51.256 --> 00:32:54.006 A:middle
Hints follow a similar format as

00:32:54.006 --> 00:32:55.776 A:middle
the glossary in that they are

00:32:55.776 --> 00:32:56.966 A:middle
using XML as well.

00:32:57.296 --> 00:32:58.646 A:middle
But these are done on a per page

00:32:58.646 --> 00:32:58.956 A:middle
level.

00:32:59.486 --> 00:33:02.456 A:middle
And each page can have one or

00:33:02.456 --> 00:33:03.706 A:middle
more hints if desired.

00:33:04.386 --> 00:33:05.906 A:middle
And this is an example of what a

00:33:05.906 --> 00:33:06.906 A:middle
hint file looks like.

00:33:07.606 --> 00:33:09.136 A:middle
And in it are several different

00:33:09.136 --> 00:33:10.566 A:middle
strings that your translators

00:33:10.566 --> 00:33:11.526 A:middle
will need to translate.

00:33:12.566 --> 00:33:13.796 A:middle
And so to -- you would make a

00:33:13.796 --> 00:33:16.076 A:middle
copy of this file and have them

00:33:16.076 --> 00:33:18.096 A:middle
localize these strings, and then

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:19.066 A:middle
you would get this output.

00:33:19.626 --> 00:33:22.746 A:middle
And this new hintplist, this

00:33:22.746 --> 00:33:24.056 A:middle
goes in the private resources

00:33:24.056 --> 00:33:25.836 A:middle
directory for that page, as they

00:33:25.836 --> 00:33:26.946 A:middle
only apply to that particular

00:33:26.946 --> 00:33:27.456 A:middle
page.

00:33:27.926 --> 00:33:29.136 A:middle
And you'd have both the English

00:33:29.136 --> 00:33:31.436 A:middle
version and the Spanish version.

00:33:31.996 --> 00:33:36.206 A:middle
And so last up are the animated

00:33:36.206 --> 00:33:38.026 A:middle
cut scenes, which are html

00:33:38.026 --> 00:33:38.606 A:middle
files.

00:33:39.176 --> 00:33:40.996 A:middle
And these, your translators will

00:33:40.996 --> 00:33:42.226 A:middle
need to make a copy for each

00:33:42.226 --> 00:33:43.786 A:middle
language and appropriately

00:33:43.786 --> 00:33:45.796 A:middle
localize the strings, as well as

00:33:45.796 --> 00:33:47.236 A:middle
potentially change any of the

00:33:47.236 --> 00:33:50.076 A:middle
concepts or images as needed per

00:33:50.076 --> 00:33:50.906 A:middle
each language.

00:33:51.416 --> 00:33:54.426 A:middle
And when they do this, you will

00:33:54.426 --> 00:33:56.296 A:middle
need to put it in the cut scene

00:33:56.296 --> 00:33:57.726 A:middle
pages private resources

00:33:57.726 --> 00:33:58.216 A:middle
directory.

00:33:58.836 --> 00:34:00.116 A:middle
So here we see the English

00:34:00.116 --> 00:34:01.396 A:middle
version is called

00:34:01.396 --> 00:34:03.476 A:middle
conditionalcode.html.

00:34:03.476 --> 00:34:05.776 A:middle
And the initial html file for

00:34:05.776 --> 00:34:07.206 A:middle
each other language needs to

00:34:07.206 --> 00:34:08.826 A:middle
follow that exact same name.

00:34:09.286 --> 00:34:10.836 A:middle
So for Spanish, even though

00:34:10.836 --> 00:34:11.796 A:middle
it'll have all the localized

00:34:11.796 --> 00:34:13.506 A:middle
terms, the file name should be

00:34:13.536 --> 00:34:15.026 A:middle
conditionalcode.html.

00:34:15.626 --> 00:34:20.036 A:middle
So in summary today, we covered

00:34:20.036 --> 00:34:21.456 A:middle
a lot about localization.

00:34:21.856 --> 00:34:23.026 A:middle
And one thing that's really key

00:34:23.026 --> 00:34:25.166 A:middle
to remember is to define who

00:34:25.166 --> 00:34:26.886 A:middle
your audience is, and be sure to

00:34:26.886 --> 00:34:28.566 A:middle
understand them when you're

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:29.706 A:middle
going into each different

00:34:29.706 --> 00:34:31.046 A:middle
language and trying to adapt the

00:34:31.046 --> 00:34:31.646 A:middle
content.

00:34:32.996 --> 00:34:34.856 A:middle
Localization is really nuance

00:34:34.856 --> 00:34:35.596 A:middle
and complex.

00:34:35.906 --> 00:34:37.406 A:middle
It requires a lot of research

00:34:37.406 --> 00:34:39.266 A:middle
and testing with actual users,

00:34:39.536 --> 00:34:40.636 A:middle
and understanding what are the

00:34:40.636 --> 00:34:42.636 A:middle
standards for each country or

00:34:42.636 --> 00:34:44.076 A:middle
language or region that you want

00:34:44.076 --> 00:34:44.676 A:middle
to go into.

00:34:45.226 --> 00:34:48.606 A:middle
And one thing to keep in mind of

00:34:48.606 --> 00:34:51.096 A:middle
all this is that localization is

00:34:51.176 --> 00:34:52.166 A:middle
really part of the design

00:34:52.166 --> 00:34:53.056 A:middle
process.

00:34:53.216 --> 00:34:54.516 A:middle
And so you should be thinking

00:34:54.516 --> 00:34:56.426 A:middle
about localization up front if

00:34:56.426 --> 00:34:57.386 A:middle
you want to have an amazing

00:34:57.386 --> 00:34:58.726 A:middle
experience for your users.

00:34:59.166 --> 00:35:01.026 A:middle
And I encourage you all to do

00:35:01.026 --> 00:35:02.596 A:middle
so, and make amazing content

00:35:02.876 --> 00:35:03.876 A:middle
that everyone in the world can

00:35:03.876 --> 00:35:04.626 A:middle
experience.

00:35:06.656 --> 00:35:08.016 A:middle
There's more information on the

00:35:08.016 --> 00:35:09.316 A:middle
developer website, as well as

00:35:09.316 --> 00:35:10.536 A:middle
the sample code that goes along

00:35:10.536 --> 00:35:10.986 A:middle
with this.

00:35:11.516 --> 00:35:14.026 A:middle
And there's some fantastic

00:35:14.026 --> 00:35:15.236 A:middle
related sessions on both

00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:17.206 A:middle
localization as well as using

00:35:17.206 --> 00:35:18.386 A:middle
Swift Playgrounds and teaching

00:35:18.386 --> 00:35:19.326 A:middle
with it.

00:35:19.896 --> 00:35:20.556 A:middle
Thank you.

00:35:21.508 --> 00:35:23.508 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheers ]
