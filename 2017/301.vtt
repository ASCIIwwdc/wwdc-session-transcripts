&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.596 A:middle
My name is Pedraum Pardehpoosh.

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:34.966 A:middle
I run Product for the App Store.

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.046 A:middle
Thanks for joining us today.

00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:38.296 A:middle
We've brought a few people

00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:40.176 A:middle
together that normally don't get

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:41.066 A:middle
out of the office.

00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:42.286 A:middle
So this is going to be a session

00:00:42.286 --> 00:00:43.236 A:middle
that might be a little different

00:00:43.236 --> 00:00:44.276 A:middle
than what you're used to here.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:46.336 A:middle
It's a deeper look into the App

00:00:46.336 --> 00:00:46.936 A:middle

00:00:47.316 --> 00:00:48.296 A:middle
And I'm thrilled that you joined

00:00:48.296 --> 00:00:48.576 A:middle
us.

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.486 A:middle
You heard about the App Store

00:00:50.486 --> 00:00:51.446 A:middle
from Phil on Monday at the

00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:51.976 A:middle
keynote.

00:00:52.526 --> 00:00:53.846 A:middle
And the staggering numbers that

00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:55.846 A:middle
demonstrate what a smash hit

00:00:55.846 --> 00:00:56.286 A:middle
it's been.

00:00:57.096 --> 00:00:59.036 A:middle
But today we're going to spend a

00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:00.146 A:middle
little time giving you an

00:01:00.146 --> 00:01:01.306 A:middle
overview of the App Store.

Go a little deeper.

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:04.356 A:middle
We'll look at the design

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:05.616 A:middle
philosophy that went into the

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:06.956 A:middle
"why" we did it.

00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:10.246 A:middle
And we'll go a little deeper

00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:11.866 A:middle
into our emphasis on editorial.

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:14.026 A:middle
Finally, we'll bring it all back

00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:15.206 A:middle
and talk about the implications

00:01:15.206 --> 00:01:17.116 A:middle
to you, the developers that

00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:17.716 A:middle
bring it to life.

00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:19.686 A:middle
Let's get started.

It's the original App Store, the

00:01:27.776 --> 00:01:27.936 A:middle
OG.

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:30.316 A:middle
It had been launched in July of

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:33.436 A:middle
2008 with 500 apps.

00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:36.536 A:middle
And this is a little inside

00:01:36.956 --> 00:01:37.866 A:middle
story.

00:01:38.106 --> 00:01:39.066 A:middle
There were some prominent

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.386 A:middle
executives at the company that

00:01:40.386 --> 00:01:41.516 A:middle
didn't think we'd have more than

00:01:41.516 --> 00:01:45.836 A:middle
a thousand apps in the App Store

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:46.356 A:middle
ever.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:47.406 A:middle
The structure and the layout of

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:48.826 A:middle
the store have largely remained

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:49.276 A:middle
the same.

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:50.246 A:middle
We changed things here and

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:51.506 A:middle
there, but overall it's the same

2.2 million apps in the store.

00:01:58.056 --> 00:01:59.516 A:middle
And it's transformed the way

Well at this point in the

00:02:41.846 --> 00:02:44.826 A:middle
history of the App Store, we

00:02:44.826 --> 00:02:46.166 A:middle
pause to consider how we can

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:46.876 A:middle
make it even better.

00:02:46.876 --> 00:02:47.926 A:middle
How we could redesign it from

00:02:47.926 --> 00:02:48.576 A:middle
the ground up.

00:02:49.726 --> 00:02:52.366 A:middle
And as we began doing that, we

00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:53.426 A:middle
realized it could serve a few

00:02:53.426 --> 00:02:54.026 A:middle
purposes.

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:57.576 A:middle
One, we thought how can we give

00:02:57.576 --> 00:02:58.796 A:middle
customers a reason to come back

00:02:58.796 --> 00:02:59.226 A:middle
every day?

00:02:59.226 --> 00:03:00.326 A:middle
Make it a destination they'd

00:03:00.326 --> 00:03:02.156 A:middle
want to visit on a daily basis?

00:03:02.636 --> 00:03:04.976 A:middle
Second, we thought this was a

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.296 A:middle
perfect time to double down on

00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:07.556 A:middle
the editorial curation that's

00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:08.486 A:middle
distinguished the App Store

00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:09.376 A:middle
since its inception.

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:11.936 A:middle
And finally, we wanted to

00:03:11.936 --> 00:03:13.146 A:middle
reflect the significance the

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:15.556 A:middle
games play in the App Store and

00:03:15.556 --> 00:03:16.916 A:middle
give both games and apps a

00:03:16.956 --> 00:03:17.776 A:middle
clearer focus.

00:03:18.356 --> 00:03:21.666 A:middle
At this stage, we began an

00:03:21.666 --> 00:03:23.756 A:middle

My name is Monika Gromek and I

lead the App Store design team

00:03:51.556 --> 00:03:52.096 A:middle
at Apple.

00:03:53.246 --> 00:03:54.806 A:middle
This redesign of the App Store

00:03:54.806 --> 00:03:57.436 A:middle
is so significant that we felt

00:03:57.436 --> 00:03:59.386 A:middle
it deserved a session dedicated

00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:00.256 A:middle
just to this one topic.

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:02.106 A:middle
And hopefully by the end of it

00:04:02.106 --> 00:04:03.366 A:middle
you'll be much more familiar

00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:04.686 A:middle
with the changes that we're

00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:06.406 A:middle
making and all the new features

that we're introducing.

00:04:08.126 --> 00:04:09.706 A:middle
I am going to cover the major

00:04:09.706 --> 00:04:10.846 A:middle
parts of the redesign.

00:04:11.336 --> 00:04:12.946 A:middle
But I would like start with our

00:04:12.946 --> 00:04:14.576 A:middle
goals and the design process.

00:04:15.276 --> 00:04:18.086 A:middle
As Pedraum mentioned, the App

00:04:18.136 --> 00:04:19.696 A:middle
Store launched nine years ago.

00:04:20.546 --> 00:04:22.496 A:middle
And it's so hard to believe that

00:04:22.566 --> 00:04:23.596 A:middle
so much time has passed.

00:04:24.586 --> 00:04:26.526 A:middle
And we are incredibly proud of

00:04:26.526 --> 00:04:27.756 A:middle
what it has become.

00:04:28.096 --> 00:04:30.346 A:middle
And mostly, thanks to all of you

00:04:30.426 --> 00:04:31.816 A:middle
and the amazing apps and games

00:04:31.856 --> 00:04:33.156 A:middle
that you create every day.

00:04:34.636 --> 00:04:36.086 A:middle
So why the redesign?

00:04:37.646 --> 00:04:39.566 A:middle
Well, it was time for us to take

00:04:39.566 --> 00:04:41.636 A:middle
a long, hard look at the current

00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:43.576 A:middle
store and acknowledge its

00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:46.116 A:middle
limitations, as none of us could

00:04:46.116 --> 00:04:48.056 A:middle
have predicted its tremendous

00:04:48.056 --> 00:04:48.406 A:middle
growth.

00:04:50.066 --> 00:04:51.936 A:middle
So just like every other app and

00:04:51.936 --> 00:04:53.496 A:middle
game creator on the App Store,

00:04:53.996 --> 00:04:55.036 A:middle
we asked ourselves two

00:04:55.036 --> 00:04:57.766 A:middle
questions: What are our goals

00:04:57.766 --> 00:04:58.156 A:middle
now?

00:04:58.646 --> 00:05:00.206 A:middle
And how does the current design

00:05:00.236 --> 00:05:00.946 A:middle
support them?

00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:04.836 A:middle
For the new store, we touched

00:05:04.836 --> 00:05:07.056 A:middle
every single view and thought

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:08.626 A:middle
hard about the structure of the

00:05:08.626 --> 00:05:08.786 A:middle
app.

00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:11.206 A:middle
Believe me, there were a lot of

00:05:11.206 --> 00:05:12.386 A:middle
options on the table.

00:05:13.286 --> 00:05:15.366 A:middle
We applied lessons from other

00:05:15.366 --> 00:05:17.696 A:middle
redesigns at Apple, but the

00:05:17.696 --> 00:05:20.036 A:middle
final design is unique to the

00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:20.606 A:middle
App Store.

00:05:22.036 --> 00:05:24.156 A:middle
The end result is a new sense of

00:05:24.226 --> 00:05:25.996 A:middle
clarity, a general

00:05:25.996 --> 00:05:28.156 A:middle
simplification of the app, and a

00:05:28.156 --> 00:05:29.726 A:middle
fresh take on editorial.

00:05:30.726 --> 00:05:32.526 A:middle
The new style of typography

00:05:33.136 --> 00:05:35.026 A:middle
helps establish hierarchy on the

00:05:35.026 --> 00:05:37.256 A:middle
pages and a sense of space.

00:05:38.156 --> 00:05:39.876 A:middle
It guides people throughout

00:05:39.876 --> 00:05:40.596 A:middle
their journey.

00:05:41.696 --> 00:05:43.436 A:middle
We've also removed extra layers

00:05:43.436 --> 00:05:45.546 A:middle
of UIs such as toggles to help

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:48.106 A:middle
with the overall experience in

00:05:48.386 --> 00:05:50.426 A:middle
the App Store.

00:05:50.636 --> 00:05:51.726 A:middle
Let's take a look at our

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:52.616 A:middle
redesign goals.

00:05:54.716 --> 00:05:55.986 A:middle
As you can see, these are

00:05:55.986 --> 00:05:58.166 A:middle
exactly the same as the ones you

00:05:58.166 --> 00:05:59.536 A:middle
heard a few minutes ago.

00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:03.386 A:middle
This alignment of goals helped

00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:04.836 A:middle
us create a product that's

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:06.646 A:middle
integrated, fluid and also

00:06:06.646 --> 00:06:07.246 A:middle
beautiful.

00:06:08.816 --> 00:06:10.706 A:middle
We did add one goal from the

00:06:10.706 --> 00:06:11.526 A:middle
design side.

00:06:13.116 --> 00:06:14.436 A:middle
And that is clarity and

00:06:14.436 --> 00:06:15.416 A:middle
simplification.

00:06:16.256 --> 00:06:17.316 A:middle
And it's probably the most

00:06:17.316 --> 00:06:18.116 A:middle
important goal.

00:06:18.296 --> 00:06:19.696 A:middle
And I will expand on it later.

00:06:19.696 --> 00:06:24.226 A:middle
I want to start by talking about

00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:25.416 A:middle
the App Store as a daily

00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:27.386 A:middle
destination and the editorial

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:28.676 A:middle
voice on the App Store, as the

00:06:28.676 --> 00:06:30.726 A:middle
two goals are very closely

00:06:30.726 --> 00:06:31.196 A:middle
related.

00:06:32.686 --> 00:06:34.166 A:middle
To do that, I want to bring up

00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:34.976 A:middle
the Today view.

00:06:35.536 --> 00:06:36.666 A:middle
You saw it in the Monday

00:06:36.766 --> 00:06:37.216 A:middle
keynote.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.066 A:middle
But let's take a closer look.

00:06:40.646 --> 00:06:42.746 A:middle
It all starts with the Today

00:06:42.746 --> 00:06:42.856 A:middle
tab.

00:06:43.676 --> 00:06:45.366 A:middle
This is our new home for the App

00:06:45.526 --> 00:06:45.756 A:middle
Store.

00:06:46.226 --> 00:06:47.526 A:middle
This is where we can share our

00:06:47.526 --> 00:06:49.176 A:middle
passion for apps and games and

00:06:49.206 --> 00:06:50.436 A:middle
celebrate all of you, the

00:06:50.436 --> 00:06:51.066 A:middle
creators.

00:06:52.386 --> 00:06:53.816 A:middle
This is where you can come and

00:06:53.816 --> 00:06:55.826 A:middle
learn our editorial perspective

00:06:55.826 --> 00:06:57.266 A:middle
on the world of apps and games.

00:06:57.806 --> 00:06:59.166 A:middle
This view is a dynamic,

00:06:59.166 --> 00:07:00.976 A:middle
ever-changing platform that

00:07:00.976 --> 00:07:02.366 A:middle
allows us to feature your

00:07:02.366 --> 00:07:04.256 A:middle
products in a very different

00:07:04.256 --> 00:07:05.886 A:middle
light than ever before.

00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:10.446 A:middle
We designed it as a series of

00:07:10.506 --> 00:07:14.286 A:middle
cards that update daily and

00:07:14.286 --> 00:07:15.946 A:middle
allow us to celebrate your apps

00:07:15.946 --> 00:07:17.456 A:middle
and games by telling stories.

00:07:18.406 --> 00:07:20.006 A:middle
We've had this desire to tell

00:07:20.066 --> 00:07:22.156 A:middle
stories for a long time now but

00:07:22.156 --> 00:07:23.596 A:middle
haven't been able to do it in a

00:07:23.596 --> 00:07:25.366 A:middle
meaningful and engaging way.

00:07:26.006 --> 00:07:27.356 A:middle
But this is all changing now

00:07:27.356 --> 00:07:28.426 A:middle
with the Today tab.

00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:31.136 A:middle
What you see here is our video

00:07:31.136 --> 00:07:31.466 A:middle
card.

00:07:32.396 --> 00:07:34.236 A:middle
We can highlight your app and

00:07:34.236 --> 00:07:36.076 A:middle
game previews and our

00:07:36.076 --> 00:07:38.606 A:middle
editorially-created videos.

00:07:39.576 --> 00:07:41.586 A:middle
We will be providing helpful

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.796 A:middle
tips and tricks as seen in this

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:45.066 A:middle
example for VSCO.

00:07:45.706 --> 00:07:48.186 A:middle
And we will be nominating an App

00:07:48.356 --> 00:07:49.786 A:middle
of the Day and a Game of the

00:07:49.786 --> 00:07:50.106 A:middle
Day.

00:07:50.756 --> 00:07:55.666 A:middle
And we will also be sharing our

00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:56.766 A:middle
curated collections.

00:07:57.446 --> 00:07:58.696 A:middle
Some of you might be familiar

00:07:58.696 --> 00:08:00.066 A:middle
with our collections, as we've

00:08:00.066 --> 00:08:01.586 A:middle
been creating them for years,

00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:03.426 A:middle
but haven't had a way to

00:08:03.426 --> 00:08:04.926 A:middle
highlight them in a predictable

00:08:04.926 --> 00:08:05.726 A:middle
way in our UI.

00:08:06.576 --> 00:08:08.006 A:middle
But again, this is different now

00:08:08.006 --> 00:08:09.406 A:middle
with the Today tab and these

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:09.806 A:middle
cards.

00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:12.596 A:middle
We spent a lot of time thinking

00:08:12.596 --> 00:08:14.306 A:middle
about how to best showcase your

00:08:14.526 --> 00:08:15.826 A:middle
apps and games in this view.

00:08:17.326 --> 00:08:18.696 A:middle
It was important to us that it

00:08:18.696 --> 00:08:20.766 A:middle
looked beautiful, so we spent a

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:22.816 A:middle
lot of time thinking about every

00:08:22.816 --> 00:08:25.176 A:middle
single detail.

00:08:25.336 --> 00:08:26.676 A:middle
Everything kept us up at night

00:08:26.766 --> 00:08:28.886 A:middle
for months, be it typography,

00:08:28.886 --> 00:08:30.536 A:middle
layout, transitions and

00:08:30.536 --> 00:08:31.246 A:middle
animations.

00:08:31.966 --> 00:08:35.626 A:middle
Each card is an entry point for

00:08:35.626 --> 00:08:36.736 A:middle
a deeper discovery.

00:08:37.916 --> 00:08:39.336 A:middle
And we also hope to give you

00:08:39.336 --> 00:08:40.946 A:middle
some context into why you should

00:08:40.946 --> 00:08:42.536 A:middle
tap in and check out that story.

00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:45.686 A:middle
At any given point we will give

00:08:45.686 --> 00:08:47.326 A:middle
you up to seven days' worth of

00:08:47.366 --> 00:08:47.936 A:middle
content.

00:08:47.996 --> 00:08:50.086 A:middle
So if you miss a day or two, you

00:08:50.086 --> 00:08:51.556 A:middle
can come back and find it later.

00:08:52.876 --> 00:08:57.976 A:middle
Just look for the date markers.

00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:00.656 A:middle
We also included animations on

00:09:00.656 --> 00:09:02.216 A:middle
some of these cards to make them

00:09:02.216 --> 00:09:02.926 A:middle
come to life.

00:09:03.586 --> 00:09:04.396 A:middle
You've already seen the

00:09:04.476 --> 00:09:05.506 A:middle
auto-playing video.

00:09:05.756 --> 00:09:06.786 A:middle
But we hope to bring more

00:09:06.786 --> 00:09:09.616 A:middle
movement into this view.

00:09:10.176 --> 00:09:11.656 A:middle
Twelve cards will be ready for

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:12.116 A:middle
launch.

00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:15.066 A:middle
We needed a variety to keep

00:09:15.066 --> 00:09:15.996 A:middle
things interesting.

00:09:16.766 --> 00:09:18.346 A:middle
But also to be able to tell

00:09:18.346 --> 00:09:19.626 A:middle
diverse type of stories.

00:09:20.316 --> 00:09:21.756 A:middle
And each one of these cards

00:09:21.756 --> 00:09:23.506 A:middle
allows us to tell a story in a

00:09:23.506 --> 00:09:24.236 A:middle
different way.

00:09:25.946 --> 00:09:27.406 A:middle
It was also important that these

00:09:27.456 --> 00:09:29.106 A:middle
cards look good together and

00:09:29.106 --> 00:09:30.016 A:middle
work as a system.

00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:33.036 A:middle
The order in which they appear

00:09:33.036 --> 00:09:35.376 A:middle
might be different, so what you

00:09:35.426 --> 00:09:36.746 A:middle
see one day might be very

00:09:36.746 --> 00:09:38.266 A:middle
different from what you will see

00:09:38.266 --> 00:09:39.436 A:middle
tomorrow, for example.

00:09:40.516 --> 00:09:42.586 A:middle
But, there's a lot of thought

00:09:42.586 --> 00:09:44.156 A:middle
that goes into creating these

00:09:44.556 --> 00:09:46.326 A:middle
every single day around the

00:09:46.326 --> 00:09:46.696 A:middle
world.

00:09:47.566 --> 00:09:48.876 A:middle
We haven't done this before.

00:09:48.936 --> 00:09:50.876 A:middle
And believe me, it keeps things

00:09:50.876 --> 00:09:52.776 A:middle
interesting, even at Apple.

00:09:53.646 --> 00:09:55.196 A:middle
I do want to share one other

00:09:55.196 --> 00:09:57.096 A:middle
thing about the cards, which is

00:09:57.376 --> 00:09:59.166 A:middle
personally important to me.

00:09:59.696 --> 00:10:01.726 A:middle
That this view is relevant world

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:02.106 A:middle
wide.

00:10:03.276 --> 00:10:05.076 A:middle
So all this content will be

00:10:05.076 --> 00:10:07.356 A:middle
localized and culturally aware

00:10:07.986 --> 00:10:09.326 A:middle
in all our territories.

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:14.646 A:middle
Let's take a closer look at one

00:10:14.646 --> 00:10:15.376 A:middle
of these stories.

00:10:16.496 --> 00:10:18.256 A:middle
It focuses on the fact that

00:10:18.256 --> 00:10:20.126 A:middle
behind every app there is a

00:10:20.126 --> 00:10:23.276 A:middle
story of who made it, what

00:10:23.276 --> 00:10:25.376 A:middle
motivated them, and how it was

00:10:25.406 --> 00:10:25.816 A:middle
made.

00:10:26.786 --> 00:10:28.676 A:middle
It celebrates you and your apps

00:10:28.676 --> 00:10:29.176 A:middle
and games.

00:10:30.226 --> 00:10:31.000 A:middle
Let's dive in.

00:10:35.796 --> 00:10:38.016 A:middle
The transition into this story

00:10:38.016 --> 00:10:39.396 A:middle
is smooth and fluid.

00:10:39.396 --> 00:10:41.846 A:middle
And it's also easy to go back

00:10:41.846 --> 00:10:42.916 A:middle
out to the Today view.

00:10:42.956 --> 00:10:44.646 A:middle
Simply tap on the X button or

00:10:44.646 --> 00:10:46.116 A:middle
swipe down on the article.

00:10:47.816 --> 00:10:49.706 A:middle
The stories are engaging and

00:10:49.706 --> 00:10:50.366 A:middle
informative.

00:10:51.046 --> 00:10:53.036 A:middle
Smokey, who leads our editorial

00:10:53.036 --> 00:10:54.566 A:middle
team, will come on stage in a

00:10:54.566 --> 00:10:55.956 A:middle
bit and talk to you about it in

00:10:55.956 --> 00:10:56.586 A:middle
more detail.

00:10:57.136 --> 00:10:58.556 A:middle
But I want to highlight a few

00:10:58.636 --> 00:10:59.966 A:middle
elements of these stories from

00:10:59.966 --> 00:11:01.066 A:middle
the design perspective.

00:11:04.336 --> 00:11:06.776 A:middle
We're letting the elements of

00:11:06.776 --> 00:11:09.006 A:middle
the stories define the space,

00:11:09.416 --> 00:11:11.086 A:middle
allowing them to breathe and

00:11:11.086 --> 00:11:12.466 A:middle
convey our perspective.

00:11:14.296 --> 00:11:17.426 A:middle
The videos let us engage with

00:11:17.426 --> 00:11:18.976 A:middle
the viewer like we've never been

00:11:18.976 --> 00:11:20.076 A:middle
able to do before.

00:11:20.816 --> 00:11:24.936 A:middle
And each story is a series of

00:11:24.936 --> 00:11:27.136 A:middle
modules defined by our design

00:11:27.196 --> 00:11:28.386 A:middle
and editorial teams.

00:11:29.096 --> 00:11:32.376 A:middle
We also hope that you will share

00:11:32.376 --> 00:11:33.856 A:middle
these stories with one another

00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:36.206 A:middle
and enjoy them as much as we do.

00:11:38.036 --> 00:11:39.066 A:middle
The modules allow for

00:11:39.066 --> 00:11:40.686 A:middle
flexibility in terms of how

00:11:40.686 --> 00:11:41.886 A:middle
these stories are built.

00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:44.706 A:middle
But they also keep things

00:11:44.766 --> 00:11:46.826 A:middle
consistent from the design side.

00:11:48.656 --> 00:11:50.476 A:middle
So we have this common language

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:51.926 A:middle
that ties them all together,

00:11:51.926 --> 00:11:53.716 A:middle
making it easier for people to

00:11:53.716 --> 00:11:57.486 A:middle
experience that content.

00:11:58.086 --> 00:11:59.436 A:middle
It's also worth mentioning that

00:11:59.486 --> 00:12:00.876 A:middle
for the first time ever this

00:12:00.876 --> 00:12:02.586 A:middle
editorial content will be

00:12:02.586 --> 00:12:03.216 A:middle
searchable.

00:12:03.736 --> 00:12:05.116 A:middle
We've actually never had that in

00:12:05.116 --> 00:12:05.656 A:middle
the App Store.

00:12:05.656 --> 00:12:07.086 A:middle
And we are incredibly excited

00:12:07.086 --> 00:12:08.866 A:middle
about this.

00:12:09.131 --> 00:12:11.131 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:12:11.246 --> 00:12:11.706 A:middle
Absolutely.

00:12:11.706 --> 00:12:15.876 A:middle
So if you miss a day, or if you

00:12:15.876 --> 00:12:17.706 A:middle
miss some of this content, be it

00:12:17.706 --> 00:12:19.126 A:middle
in the Today tab or any other

00:12:19.196 --> 00:12:20.216 A:middle
place in the App Store, you can

00:12:20.246 --> 00:12:21.456 A:middle
simply search for it later.

00:12:22.256 --> 00:12:23.466 A:middle
It will be featured on the

00:12:23.466 --> 00:12:25.086 A:middle
product page as well for that

00:12:25.276 --> 00:12:25.846 A:middle
app or game.

00:12:26.416 --> 00:12:29.986 A:middle
And of course, the Today tab

00:12:30.066 --> 00:12:32.726 A:middle
will be part of this App Store

00:12:33.996 --> 00:12:35.366 A:middle
on the iPad.

00:12:35.366 --> 00:12:36.526 A:middle
And that is the Today view.

00:12:36.526 --> 00:12:38.466 A:middle
We're incredibly excited about

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:39.916 A:middle
how it looks and how it works.

00:12:39.996 --> 00:12:41.996 A:middle
But more importantly, about the

00:12:41.996 --> 00:12:44.316 A:middle
type of stories it will allow us

00:12:44.376 --> 00:12:46.076 A:middle
to tell you every single day.

00:12:46.706 --> 00:12:50.986 A:middle
Let's talk about games next.

00:12:52.156 --> 00:12:54.136 A:middle
Games have been always a huge

00:12:54.186 --> 00:12:55.226 A:middle
part of the App Store.

00:12:56.866 --> 00:12:58.406 A:middle
But up to this point always

00:12:58.446 --> 00:13:00.526 A:middle
mixed with apps throughout our

00:13:00.586 --> 00:13:01.806 A:middle
editorial and charts.

00:13:03.286 --> 00:13:05.036 A:middle
Because of their importance and

00:13:05.036 --> 00:13:07.656 A:middle
success, we're dedicating a home

00:13:07.656 --> 00:13:09.956 A:middle
just for games in the App Store.

00:13:10.006 --> 00:13:12.326 A:middle
And that is the new Games tab.

00:13:13.206 --> 00:13:14.906 A:middle
It is more than a tab.

00:13:15.426 --> 00:13:17.256 A:middle
We're striving to create the

00:13:17.256 --> 00:13:19.536 A:middle
best, world's best game store.

00:13:20.086 --> 00:13:22.116 A:middle
Full of amazing content that

00:13:22.116 --> 00:13:23.206 A:middle
people are going to love.

00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:26.056 A:middle
The top of the page allows for

00:13:26.776 --> 00:13:28.976 A:middle
space for more stories to be

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:32.596 A:middle
dedicated just to games or new

00:13:32.596 --> 00:13:33.156 A:middle
releases.

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:36.896 A:middle
And with more focus on videos,

00:13:36.946 --> 00:13:39.436 A:middle
people will be able to discover

00:13:39.616 --> 00:13:41.066 A:middle
games much more quickly and

00:13:41.066 --> 00:13:42.316 A:middle
engage with them almost

00:13:42.316 --> 00:13:42.976 A:middle
immediately.

00:13:43.576 --> 00:13:48.456 A:middle
The split between apps and games

00:13:48.906 --> 00:13:50.666 A:middle
also allowed us to make charts

00:13:50.716 --> 00:13:51.986 A:middle
much more relevant in the App

00:13:52.186 --> 00:13:52.406 A:middle
Store.

00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:55.706 A:middle
So, the charts that you're

00:13:55.706 --> 00:13:57.386 A:middle
seeing are specifically

00:13:57.386 --> 00:13:58.386 A:middle
dedicated to games.

00:13:58.386 --> 00:14:00.036 A:middle
And the same is true for apps.

00:14:00.326 --> 00:14:01.736 A:middle
They will not be mixed in.

00:14:02.286 --> 00:14:05.116 A:middle
We think this will actually make

00:14:05.116 --> 00:14:06.776 A:middle
it a lot easier to find what's

00:14:06.816 --> 00:14:10.386 A:middle
popular on the App Store.

00:14:10.776 --> 00:14:12.436 A:middle
The same is true of categories.

00:14:13.126 --> 00:14:14.566 A:middle
As some of you may know, games

00:14:14.566 --> 00:14:16.006 A:middle
was just one of the categories

00:14:16.006 --> 00:14:16.896 A:middle
in the previous store.

00:14:17.536 --> 00:14:19.046 A:middle
Unfortunately, what it meant is

00:14:19.046 --> 00:14:20.696 A:middle
that all the subcategories were

00:14:20.696 --> 00:14:22.406 A:middle
harder to find and all that

00:14:22.606 --> 00:14:23.866 A:middle
content was hidden.

00:14:24.986 --> 00:14:28.536 A:middle
But creating a tab dedicated for

00:14:28.536 --> 00:14:30.396 A:middle
games, we can take all those

00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:32.156 A:middle
categories and put them on the

00:14:32.156 --> 00:14:34.806 A:middle
top level, making browsing by

00:14:34.806 --> 00:14:36.886 A:middle
categories a lot easier and that

00:14:36.886 --> 00:14:39.406 A:middle
content a lot easier to find.

00:14:39.906 --> 00:14:43.386 A:middle
Throughout the App Store will

00:14:43.386 --> 00:14:44.986 A:middle
also be providing more context

00:14:45.666 --> 00:14:47.206 A:middle
for any particular app or game.

00:14:47.466 --> 00:14:48.896 A:middle
The App Store is no longer just

00:14:50.276 --> 00:14:51.536 A:middle
app icons.

00:14:51.706 --> 00:14:54.166 A:middle
We want to help people find what

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:55.716 A:middle
they're looking for and make the

00:14:55.716 --> 00:14:56.856 A:middle
right download choices.

00:14:57.866 --> 00:14:59.846 A:middle
The context can come from your

00:14:59.846 --> 00:15:01.326 A:middle
subtitles that you will be

00:15:01.326 --> 00:15:02.696 A:middle
providing for your apps.

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:05.086 A:middle
And these subtitles are as

00:15:05.086 --> 00:15:06.586 A:middle
important as your app names

00:15:06.636 --> 00:15:07.046 A:middle
today.

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:09.556 A:middle
And again, it's to provide

00:15:09.556 --> 00:15:11.036 A:middle
people with more information

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:12.226 A:middle
about your app and game.

00:15:12.836 --> 00:15:16.466 A:middle
The context can also come from

00:15:16.466 --> 00:15:17.646 A:middle
the editorial team.

00:15:18.026 --> 00:15:19.326 A:middle
And you will see more and more

00:15:19.326 --> 00:15:23.266 A:middle
of it throughout the App Store.

00:15:23.476 --> 00:15:24.956 A:middle
And that is the new Games tab.

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:26.636 A:middle
We're incredibly excited about

00:15:26.636 --> 00:15:28.176 A:middle
having a dedicated home for

00:15:28.176 --> 00:15:28.546 A:middle
games.

00:15:29.456 --> 00:15:30.766 A:middle
Before we move on, I just wanted

00:15:30.766 --> 00:15:32.256 A:middle
to highlight a small but playful

00:15:32.256 --> 00:15:33.916 A:middle
detail about the Games tab.

00:15:34.756 --> 00:15:38.246 A:middle
Icon. The shape of the rocket is

00:15:38.246 --> 00:15:39.786 A:middle
actually based on the leaf from

00:15:39.786 --> 00:15:40.536 A:middle
the Apple logo.

00:15:41.326 --> 00:15:42.276 A:middle
We thought some of you might

00:15:42.336 --> 00:15:43.186 A:middle
find it interesting.

00:15:43.756 --> 00:15:46.346 A:middle
In addition to the Games tab,

00:15:46.666 --> 00:15:48.516 A:middle
we're also creating a new home

00:15:48.516 --> 00:15:49.936 A:middle
for apps.

00:15:51.136 --> 00:15:53.086 A:middle
All the amazing content that you

00:15:53.136 --> 00:15:54.916 A:middle
saw for the Games tab will also

00:15:54.916 --> 00:15:56.746 A:middle
be available in the Apps tab.

00:15:57.856 --> 00:15:59.206 A:middle
From the design perspective

00:15:59.206 --> 00:16:00.486 A:middle
there was always this tension

00:16:00.486 --> 00:16:01.626 A:middle
between apps and games.

00:16:01.896 --> 00:16:03.546 A:middle
And we felt it was a problem we

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.606 A:middle
needed to solve, as apps are

00:16:05.606 --> 00:16:07.766 A:middle
incredibly important and have a

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:10.326 A:middle
huge impact on how we live our

00:16:10.456 --> 00:16:10.596 A:middle
lives.

00:16:12.126 --> 00:16:13.686 A:middle
By splitting games and apps we

00:16:13.686 --> 00:16:15.186 A:middle
can give both of them the

00:16:15.186 --> 00:16:18.836 A:middle
attention they deserve.

00:16:18.996 --> 00:16:20.996 A:middle
And finding new apps will be so

00:16:20.996 --> 00:16:23.176 A:middle
much easier with App Previews,

00:16:23.726 --> 00:16:25.206 A:middle
as you see in this example for

00:16:25.206 --> 00:16:25.676 A:middle
Mammals.

00:16:26.366 --> 00:16:29.486 A:middle
What you will see in both tabs

00:16:29.726 --> 00:16:30.756 A:middle
are in-app purchases.

00:16:31.696 --> 00:16:33.276 A:middle
Up to this point they had a very

00:16:33.276 --> 00:16:34.426 A:middle
limited presence in the App

00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:34.836 A:middle
Store.

00:16:36.266 --> 00:16:37.666 A:middle
But we're changing it completely

00:16:37.666 --> 00:16:38.746 A:middle
with this redesign.

00:16:39.956 --> 00:16:40.906 A:middle
They will be much more

00:16:40.906 --> 00:16:42.716 A:middle
accessible and discoverable

00:16:42.716 --> 00:16:46.236 A:middle
throughout the App Store.

00:16:46.456 --> 00:16:47.636 A:middle
You will see them on the Today

00:16:47.636 --> 00:16:47.746 A:middle
tab.

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:49.586 A:middle
We actually designed a card

00:16:49.646 --> 00:16:50.656 A:middle
specifically for in-app

00:16:50.716 --> 00:16:51.066 A:middle
purchases.

00:16:51.066 --> 00:16:53.146 A:middle
They will be highlighted on the

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:54.176 A:middle
Apps and Games tab.

00:16:54.306 --> 00:16:56.126 A:middle
And they will be searchable.

00:16:57.096 --> 00:16:58.626 A:middle
They will also be featured by

00:16:58.756 --> 00:17:00.186 A:middle
you on your product pages.

00:17:00.506 --> 00:17:01.746 A:middle
It is a complete story.

00:17:02.906 --> 00:17:04.106 A:middle
What's probably even more

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:06.656 A:middle
important, how easy it is to get

00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:08.476 A:middle
the in-app purchases, especially

00:17:08.476 --> 00:17:10.446 A:middle
if you have the app installed on

00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:10.986 A:middle
your own device.

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:12.576 A:middle
I'm going to start with the

00:17:12.576 --> 00:17:14.036 A:middle
Today tab and the card

00:17:14.426 --> 00:17:16.206 A:middle
specifically designed for the

00:17:16.206 --> 00:17:16.856 A:middle
in-app purchases.

00:17:16.856 --> 00:17:18.846 A:middle
I'm going to tap on the Buy

00:17:18.846 --> 00:17:19.336 A:middle
button.

00:17:20.626 --> 00:17:21.466 A:middle
The app will open.

00:17:21.466 --> 00:17:24.876 A:middle
And the purchase sheet will come

00:17:26.226 --> 00:17:26.316 A:middle
up.

00:17:26.316 --> 00:17:28.316 A:middle
I can confirm with Touch ID and

00:17:28.376 --> 00:17:29.376 A:middle
I'm done.

00:17:29.496 --> 00:17:31.726 A:middle
It's simple and direct.

00:17:32.516 --> 00:17:37.716 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:17:38.216 --> 00:17:39.446 A:middle
When designing the visual

00:17:39.446 --> 00:17:40.766 A:middle
treatment for in-app purchases,

00:17:40.766 --> 00:17:42.856 A:middle
it was important to us that

00:17:42.856 --> 00:17:44.216 A:middle
these wouldn't be confused for

00:17:44.216 --> 00:17:45.296 A:middle
being app icons.

00:17:46.296 --> 00:17:47.816 A:middle
We started with the image that

00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:48.966 A:middle
you will be providing for

00:17:48.966 --> 00:17:50.396 A:middle
featuring your in-app purchases.

00:17:50.396 --> 00:17:53.306 A:middle
And we added a framing system

00:17:53.566 --> 00:17:54.966 A:middle
that helps convey what these

00:17:54.966 --> 00:17:57.096 A:middle
truly are, in addition to an app

00:17:57.096 --> 00:17:57.726 A:middle
or a game.

00:17:58.566 --> 00:18:00.086 A:middle
And the [inaudible] helps

00:18:00.126 --> 00:18:03.256 A:middle
communicate that as well.

00:18:03.786 --> 00:18:05.926 A:middle
The curve of the frame actually

00:18:05.926 --> 00:18:07.156 A:middle
follows the shape of the app

00:18:07.346 --> 00:18:09.056 A:middle
icons on the App Store today.

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:11.286 A:middle
And the way we think of in-app

00:18:11.336 --> 00:18:13.106 A:middle
purchases is that they are the

00:18:13.186 --> 00:18:15.026 A:middle
smaller part of the larger

00:18:15.076 --> 00:18:18.846 A:middle
piece, which is the app itself.

00:18:19.856 --> 00:18:21.486 A:middle
It was also still important to

00:18:21.486 --> 00:18:23.076 A:middle
us to keep that connection

00:18:23.286 --> 00:18:24.676 A:middle
between the in-app purchase and

00:18:24.676 --> 00:18:25.426 A:middle
the parent app.

00:18:27.026 --> 00:18:28.726 A:middle
So we added the app icon in the

00:18:28.726 --> 00:18:30.806 A:middle
lower left corner, again for

00:18:30.806 --> 00:18:31.536 A:middle
more context.

00:18:32.346 --> 00:18:34.756 A:middle
If you would like to feature

00:18:34.756 --> 00:18:36.866 A:middle
your in-app purchases on a

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:38.466 A:middle
store, you will need to submit

00:18:38.466 --> 00:18:40.226 A:middle
an image for every single one of

00:18:40.226 --> 00:18:41.266 A:middle
your in-app purchases.

00:18:42.216 --> 00:18:43.726 A:middle
It needs to be a custom design

00:18:44.006 --> 00:18:46.176 A:middle
asset that helps describe what

00:18:46.176 --> 00:18:47.556 A:middle
your in-app purchase is about.

00:18:48.416 --> 00:18:49.876 A:middle
It should not be a screen shot

00:18:49.926 --> 00:18:52.136 A:middle
from your app or an app icon.

00:18:52.776 --> 00:18:57.456 A:middle
The last goal, clarity and

00:18:57.456 --> 00:18:59.766 A:middle
simplification, is also the most

00:18:59.766 --> 00:19:01.036 A:middle
important, like I mentioned

00:19:01.296 --> 00:19:02.426 A:middle
earlier, from the design

00:19:02.426 --> 00:19:03.056 A:middle
perspective.

00:19:04.326 --> 00:19:05.406 A:middle
It also had the biggest

00:19:05.406 --> 00:19:06.876 A:middle
influence on the entire

00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:07.576 A:middle
redesign.

00:19:08.916 --> 00:19:10.576 A:middle
When designing our products, we

00:19:10.576 --> 00:19:13.046 A:middle
constantly ask ourselves: Is

00:19:13.046 --> 00:19:13.876 A:middle
this simple enough?

00:19:14.256 --> 00:19:15.886 A:middle
Is this clear to everyone?

00:19:16.276 --> 00:19:17.976 A:middle
And can we achieve the same goal

00:19:17.976 --> 00:19:19.366 A:middle
with less?

00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:22.956 A:middle
The most significant area of the

00:19:22.956 --> 00:19:24.396 A:middle
App Store that probably

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:27.156 A:middle
demonstrates how this goal

00:19:27.156 --> 00:19:28.586 A:middle
affected our process is the

00:19:28.586 --> 00:19:29.386 A:middle
Product page.

00:19:30.056 --> 00:19:31.726 A:middle
This is also home for your apps.

00:19:31.856 --> 00:19:32.916 A:middle
So I want to spend a little more

00:19:32.916 --> 00:19:34.306 A:middle
time on it.

00:19:35.576 --> 00:19:37.916 A:middle
Over the years, we've added a

00:19:37.916 --> 00:19:39.286 A:middle
lot of different features to

00:19:39.286 --> 00:19:41.316 A:middle
this page without having the

00:19:41.316 --> 00:19:43.256 A:middle
opportunity to take a step back

00:19:43.256 --> 00:19:44.646 A:middle
and look at it holistically.

00:19:45.486 --> 00:19:47.106 A:middle
We knew we had to simplify,

00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:49.736 A:middle
especially the top of the page,

00:19:49.736 --> 00:19:51.396 A:middle
as this is what your customers

00:19:51.616 --> 00:19:52.206 A:middle
see first.

00:19:52.846 --> 00:19:54.256 A:middle
And all of the relevant

00:19:54.256 --> 00:19:56.016 A:middle
information had to be clearly

00:19:56.016 --> 00:19:56.726 A:middle
communicated.

00:20:00.796 --> 00:20:02.466 A:middle
We wanted to highlight this

00:20:02.466 --> 00:20:03.846 A:middle
app's achievement on the App

00:20:04.056 --> 00:20:04.316 A:middle
Store.

00:20:04.986 --> 00:20:06.876 A:middle
So its star rating, Editor's

00:20:06.876 --> 00:20:09.176 A:middle
Choice and charting position, if

00:20:09.176 --> 00:20:09.826 A:middle
available.

00:20:11.026 --> 00:20:12.656 A:middle
We included age rating to this

00:20:12.686 --> 00:20:13.786 A:middle
section, as we know it's

00:20:13.786 --> 00:20:15.426 A:middle
incredibly important, especially

00:20:15.426 --> 00:20:17.006 A:middle
for those of us who are parents.

00:20:18.486 --> 00:20:19.936 A:middle
All this information had to be

00:20:19.936 --> 00:20:23.176 A:middle
quickly scannable and easy to

00:20:24.346 --> 00:20:24.616 A:middle
understand.

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:26.986 A:middle
Videos and screenshots are still

00:20:26.986 --> 00:20:28.556 A:middle
the heroes of this page, just

00:20:28.556 --> 00:20:29.466 A:middle
like they are today.

00:20:30.056 --> 00:20:31.696 A:middle
But now with auto-playing video,

00:20:31.696 --> 00:20:33.216 A:middle
this page comes to life.

00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:36.656 A:middle
You will also get up to three

00:20:36.656 --> 00:20:38.036 A:middle
videos versus just one.

00:20:38.036 --> 00:20:40.976 A:middle
And we know that people want to

00:20:40.976 --> 00:20:42.406 A:middle
engage with beautiful app

00:20:42.466 --> 00:20:42.956 A:middle
previews.

00:20:43.286 --> 00:20:44.896 A:middle
And we will feature them much

00:20:44.896 --> 00:20:49.066 A:middle
more heavily throughout our UI.

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:54.096 A:middle
We redesigned how we communicate

00:20:54.976 --> 00:20:56.446 A:middle
if this app is universal.

00:20:57.196 --> 00:20:58.806 A:middle
This is also how you see screen

00:20:58.806 --> 00:21:00.256 A:middle
shots from the other devices.

00:21:01.336 --> 00:21:02.936 A:middle
We enjoy apps that have been

00:21:02.936 --> 00:21:04.146 A:middle
designed and work on all the

00:21:04.146 --> 00:21:05.046 A:middle
different devices.

00:21:05.656 --> 00:21:10.916 A:middle
We drastically simplified how we

00:21:11.116 --> 00:21:13.906 A:middle
present ratings and reviews.

00:21:15.956 --> 00:21:18.416 A:middle
They're much easier to read, and

00:21:18.416 --> 00:21:20.196 A:middle
their presentation has -- their

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:21.736 A:middle
graphic presentation has been

00:21:21.736 --> 00:21:22.246 A:middle
refined.

00:21:23.446 --> 00:21:26.116 A:middle
We've removed the All versions

00:21:26.306 --> 00:21:28.836 A:middle
versus Current version split

00:21:28.906 --> 00:21:29.726 A:middle
between ratings.

00:21:30.226 --> 00:21:31.856 A:middle
So updating your apps will no

00:21:31.856 --> 00:21:33.826 A:middle
longer hide your ratings the way

00:21:33.826 --> 00:21:34.276 A:middle
it does today.

00:21:34.846 --> 00:21:41.876 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:21:42.376 --> 00:21:43.926 A:middle
The reviews are really easy to

00:21:43.926 --> 00:21:44.476 A:middle
navigate.

00:21:44.506 --> 00:21:46.226 A:middle
Simply swipe to the left or tap

00:21:46.226 --> 00:21:47.226 A:middle
on the CL link.

00:21:48.676 --> 00:21:50.536 A:middle
And we included the Editor's

00:21:50.536 --> 00:21:52.236 A:middle
Choice in this section as well.

00:21:52.316 --> 00:21:53.616 A:middle
So all the reviews are in one

00:21:53.686 --> 00:21:54.016 A:middle
place.

00:21:55.066 --> 00:21:56.166 A:middle
The information section

00:21:56.166 --> 00:21:57.806 A:middle
underwent a makeover as well.

00:21:57.886 --> 00:22:01.316 A:middle
So it's a lot easier to read.

00:22:01.716 --> 00:22:03.296 A:middle
And we are featuring more apps

00:22:03.296 --> 00:22:05.576 A:middle
and games by this developer on

00:22:05.576 --> 00:22:07.976 A:middle
this page or any other products

00:22:08.066 --> 00:22:09.556 A:middle
that are related and you might

00:22:09.556 --> 00:22:09.846 A:middle
like.

00:22:11.586 --> 00:22:13.046 A:middle
Lastly, it was important to us

00:22:13.276 --> 00:22:17.266 A:middle
to make it easy for you as you

00:22:17.266 --> 00:22:19.326 A:middle
scroll down the page to download

00:22:19.326 --> 00:22:19.526 A:middle
the app.

00:22:21.236 --> 00:22:22.836 A:middle
We love the bar that comes down

00:22:22.886 --> 00:22:24.446 A:middle
as you absorb the content.

00:22:25.026 --> 00:22:27.116 A:middle
The transition is smooth and the

00:22:27.116 --> 00:22:28.646 A:middle
bar is integrated with the

00:22:28.646 --> 00:22:30.036 A:middle
overall page design.

00:22:30.586 --> 00:22:34.086 A:middle
And that is the redesigned App

00:22:34.166 --> 00:22:34.396 A:middle
Store.

00:22:35.716 --> 00:22:37.186 A:middle
We worked hard to make the new

00:22:37.186 --> 00:22:38.776 A:middle
store a place people will love

00:22:38.776 --> 00:22:40.406 A:middle
and will want to come to every

00:22:40.406 --> 00:22:40.716 A:middle
day.

00:22:40.716 --> 00:22:42.116 A:middle
And we hope you agree.

00:22:42.836 --> 00:22:44.286 A:middle
Next, I want to invite Smokey

00:22:44.286 --> 00:22:45.726 A:middle
Fontaine to talk to you about

00:22:45.726 --> 00:22:47.486 A:middle
our editorial strategy for the

00:22:47.486 --> 00:22:48.176 A:middle
new App Store.

00:22:49.166 --> 00:22:49.926 A:middle
Thank you all for your

00:22:50.096 --> 00:22:50.330 A:middle
attention.

00:22:51.016 --> 00:22:54.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:22:55.066 --> 00:22:55.546 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Monika.

00:22:56.806 --> 00:22:58.396 A:middle
Thank you, Monika, so much for

00:22:58.396 --> 00:22:59.676 A:middle
showing us that beautiful,

00:22:59.676 --> 00:23:00.896 A:middle
beautiful redesign.

00:23:01.316 --> 00:23:02.756 A:middle
My name is Smokey Fontaine.

00:23:02.756 --> 00:23:05.136 A:middle
And yes, that is my real name.

00:23:05.136 --> 00:23:06.806 A:middle
In many ways I'm glad they don't

00:23:06.806 --> 00:23:07.806 A:middle
let me touch the product.

00:23:07.806 --> 00:23:08.946 A:middle
I only get to touch the

00:23:08.986 --> 00:23:09.696 A:middle
editorial.

00:23:10.176 --> 00:23:11.966 A:middle
I am the editorial director here

00:23:11.966 --> 00:23:13.016 A:middle
of the App Store.

00:23:13.016 --> 00:23:14.796 A:middle
It is my great pleasure to

00:23:14.796 --> 00:23:16.536 A:middle
really talk to us about what

00:23:16.536 --> 00:23:18.706 A:middle
does "editorial" mean for the

00:23:18.706 --> 00:23:19.336 A:middle
App Store?

00:23:19.786 --> 00:23:22.026 A:middle
How does original content, how

00:23:22.026 --> 00:23:23.606 A:middle
will it bring our customers to

00:23:23.606 --> 00:23:25.066 A:middle
the store in new and exciting

00:23:25.066 --> 00:23:25.606 A:middle
ways?

00:23:25.976 --> 00:23:27.046 A:middle
And how can our added

00:23:27.046 --> 00:23:29.196 A:middle
perspective really transform the

00:23:29.196 --> 00:23:30.976 A:middle
store from the phenomenal

00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:32.146 A:middle
service and utility it has

00:23:32.146 --> 00:23:34.726 A:middle
always been to a place where our

00:23:34.726 --> 00:23:36.426 A:middle
users and our customers can come

00:23:36.426 --> 00:23:38.966 A:middle
back and read, watch, and

00:23:38.966 --> 00:23:41.346 A:middle
listen, and discover more than

00:23:41.346 --> 00:23:43.486 A:middle
they ever, ever have before.

00:23:43.896 --> 00:23:47.516 A:middle
Here's what we're going to

00:23:47.516 --> 00:23:48.086 A:middle
cover.

00:23:48.356 --> 00:23:49.906 A:middle
Our editorial principles.

00:23:50.376 --> 00:23:51.726 A:middle
We have the set of new tabs, as

00:23:51.726 --> 00:23:53.016 A:middle
you've seen today, games and

00:23:53.016 --> 00:23:53.486 A:middle
apps.

00:23:54.056 --> 00:23:56.216 A:middle
More options for you.

00:23:56.216 --> 00:23:58.076 A:middle
And we'll end with the big

00:23:58.076 --> 00:23:58.436 A:middle
question.

00:23:59.016 --> 00:24:01.546 A:middle
Let's start with who we are.

00:24:02.146 --> 00:24:03.956 A:middle
Who is the Editorial Team?

00:24:04.466 --> 00:24:05.846 A:middle
Well, first and foremost, we are

00:24:05.926 --> 00:24:06.476 A:middle
fans.

00:24:06.826 --> 00:24:08.806 A:middle
We are fans of all of the work

00:24:08.806 --> 00:24:09.386 A:middle
that you do.

00:24:09.386 --> 00:24:10.426 A:middle
We really, really love this

00:24:10.426 --> 00:24:10.666 A:middle
stuff.

00:24:10.666 --> 00:24:12.376 A:middle
In fact, I'm standing here right

00:24:12.376 --> 00:24:13.676 A:middle
now without my phone.

00:24:13.926 --> 00:24:15.346 A:middle
And I'm feeling a little lonely.

00:24:15.346 --> 00:24:16.556 A:middle
How many folks have actually

00:24:16.556 --> 00:24:17.666 A:middle
used an app since this

00:24:17.696 --> 00:24:18.806 A:middle
presentation has been on?

00:24:18.806 --> 00:24:20.876 A:middle
Anyone? How many people have

00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:21.886 A:middle
played a game since this

00:24:21.886 --> 00:24:22.826 A:middle
presentation has been on?

00:24:22.826 --> 00:24:24.596 A:middle
Anyone? Well, maybe you're even

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:25.496 A:middle
making, you're finishing your

00:24:25.496 --> 00:24:27.016 A:middle
apps and polishing up your games

00:24:27.016 --> 00:24:27.726 A:middle
as we speak.

00:24:27.726 --> 00:24:29.506 A:middle
And that's what we love to do as

00:24:29.506 --> 00:24:29.906 A:middle
well.

00:24:30.096 --> 00:24:31.596 A:middle
In fact, all of our App Store

00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:33.186 A:middle
editors around the world wake up

00:24:33.186 --> 00:24:35.316 A:middle
really excited to try to find

00:24:35.316 --> 00:24:36.596 A:middle
that innovative new app that

00:24:36.596 --> 00:24:37.846 A:middle
could change someone's life.

00:24:38.336 --> 00:24:40.006 A:middle
Or that exciting game that

00:24:40.006 --> 00:24:41.296 A:middle
customers will spend hours and

00:24:41.396 --> 00:24:42.656 A:middle
hours and hours playing.

00:24:42.936 --> 00:24:44.846 A:middle
We care deeply about all the

00:24:44.846 --> 00:24:45.986 A:middle
recommendations we make.

00:24:45.986 --> 00:24:47.276 A:middle
And it is true.

00:24:47.276 --> 00:24:49.606 A:middle
We play every game we recommend.

00:24:49.976 --> 00:24:51.996 A:middle
And we use every app that we

00:24:51.996 --> 00:24:52.576 A:middle
recommend.

00:24:52.926 --> 00:24:54.606 A:middle
The redesign is so exciting for

00:24:54.606 --> 00:24:56.356 A:middle
us because now we have the

00:24:56.356 --> 00:24:57.866 A:middle
ability to provide even more

00:24:57.866 --> 00:25:00.216 A:middle
context, even more perspective,

00:25:00.526 --> 00:25:02.316 A:middle
and in many ways a narrative to

00:25:02.316 --> 00:25:03.296 A:middle
our recommendations.

00:25:03.546 --> 00:25:04.956 A:middle
So customers can come and find

00:25:04.956 --> 00:25:06.646 A:middle
everything they want and need

00:25:06.646 --> 00:25:07.226 A:middle
and love.

00:25:07.446 --> 00:25:09.166 A:middle
Find all of the work that you

00:25:09.306 --> 00:25:09.746 A:middle
create.

00:25:09.746 --> 00:25:12.626 A:middle
We have a set of editorial

00:25:12.626 --> 00:25:13.386 A:middle
principles.

00:25:13.796 --> 00:25:15.256 A:middle
And if you come to our story

00:25:15.256 --> 00:25:17.296 A:middle
rooms around the world, and this

00:25:17.296 --> 00:25:18.966 A:middle
is not just in Cupertino, but

00:25:18.966 --> 00:25:20.726 A:middle
this is in London and Tokyo.

00:25:20.726 --> 00:25:21.746 A:middle
This is in Seoul.

00:25:21.746 --> 00:25:23.546 A:middle
This is even in Dubai.

00:25:23.866 --> 00:25:25.436 A:middle
These editorial principles

00:25:25.646 --> 00:25:27.676 A:middle
really guide the writing that we

00:25:27.676 --> 00:25:28.466 A:middle
will write.

00:25:28.466 --> 00:25:30.296 A:middle
They will guide our creative

00:25:30.466 --> 00:25:31.086 A:middle
process.

00:25:31.426 --> 00:25:33.366 A:middle
We start with the first one.

00:25:33.576 --> 00:25:34.936 A:middle
We celebrate apps.

00:25:35.276 --> 00:25:36.686 A:middle
This for us is really our most

00:25:36.686 --> 00:25:37.406 A:middle
important point.

00:25:37.756 --> 00:25:39.806 A:middle
Now that we have a bigger

00:25:39.806 --> 00:25:42.336 A:middle
editorial platform, it does not

00:25:42.336 --> 00:25:43.476 A:middle
mean that we're going to all of

00:25:43.476 --> 00:25:44.696 A:middle
a sudden start reviewing apps.

00:25:44.836 --> 00:25:46.096 A:middle
It does not mean that we're

00:25:46.096 --> 00:25:47.096 A:middle
going to all of a sudden going

00:25:47.096 --> 00:25:48.776 A:middle
to start criticizing apps.

00:25:48.776 --> 00:25:49.856 A:middle
We are cheer leaders.

00:25:49.966 --> 00:25:52.196 A:middle
Unapologetic cheerleaders of

00:25:52.196 --> 00:25:53.696 A:middle
apps and app culture.

00:25:54.906 --> 00:25:55.946 A:middle
For us, it's really the most

00:25:55.946 --> 00:25:57.416 A:middle
creative work in the world.

00:25:57.636 --> 00:25:58.706 A:middle
And that is our number one

00:25:58.706 --> 00:25:59.206 A:middle
principle.

00:25:59.206 --> 00:26:01.996 A:middle
We celebrate apps.

00:26:02.236 --> 00:26:03.946 A:middle
Second is that we are the voice

00:26:03.946 --> 00:26:05.116 A:middle
of the App Store.

00:26:05.116 --> 00:26:06.216 A:middle
You know, during this redesign

00:26:06.216 --> 00:26:07.616 A:middle
we thought long and hard about

00:26:07.876 --> 00:26:08.876 A:middle
not only what we're going to

00:26:08.876 --> 00:26:10.676 A:middle
write, but how we're going to

00:26:10.676 --> 00:26:11.056 A:middle
write it.

00:26:11.776 --> 00:26:13.226 A:middle
It's a big responsibility to be

00:26:13.226 --> 00:26:13.896 A:middle
that voice.

00:26:13.896 --> 00:26:15.086 A:middle
It's a big responsibility to

00:26:15.086 --> 00:26:16.706 A:middle
kind of be the mouthpiece to

00:26:16.706 --> 00:26:17.726 A:middle
hundreds and hundreds of

00:26:17.726 --> 00:26:18.846 A:middle
millions of customers.

00:26:19.236 --> 00:26:20.596 A:middle
And for that we want to kind of

00:26:20.596 --> 00:26:21.976 A:middle
be authentic to who we are.

00:26:22.276 --> 00:26:24.286 A:middle
We want it to be smart and fun.

00:26:24.966 --> 00:26:26.446 A:middle
We want it to be humble, for

00:26:26.446 --> 00:26:26.976 A:middle
sure.

00:26:26.976 --> 00:26:28.126 A:middle
And very friendly.

00:26:28.126 --> 00:26:29.256 A:middle
Hopefully, a lot of our work

00:26:29.256 --> 00:26:29.936 A:middle
will be in a kind of

00:26:29.996 --> 00:26:31.276 A:middle
conversational tone.

00:26:31.776 --> 00:26:33.106 A:middle
And of course, we want to be

00:26:33.146 --> 00:26:34.506 A:middle
passionate about all the stuff.

00:26:35.096 --> 00:26:36.316 A:middle
We are going to be very Apple.

00:26:36.316 --> 00:26:37.566 A:middle
We're going to obsess over every

00:26:37.566 --> 00:26:39.706 A:middle
word, every word, every word, so

00:26:39.706 --> 00:26:40.966 A:middle
that our customers can -- we can

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:42.696 A:middle
help them and engage them as

00:26:42.746 --> 00:26:43.896 A:middle
best as we can.

00:26:45.256 --> 00:26:46.406 A:middle
What's our third principle?

00:26:46.406 --> 00:26:48.096 A:middle
Well, we offer independent

00:26:48.156 --> 00:26:48.876 A:middle
insights.

00:26:49.116 --> 00:26:49.996 A:middle
What's one of the biggest

00:26:49.996 --> 00:26:51.256 A:middle
criticisms of the App Store?

00:26:51.256 --> 00:26:52.356 A:middle
Well, that it's all paid

00:26:52.356 --> 00:26:53.086 A:middle
marketing, right?

00:26:53.636 --> 00:26:54.886 A:middle
Many of you in this room may

00:26:54.886 --> 00:26:57.626 A:middle
have tried to engage us with

00:26:57.766 --> 00:26:58.976 A:middle
suggestions to feature one of

00:26:58.976 --> 00:27:00.216 A:middle
your apps or feature one of your

00:27:00.216 --> 00:27:00.696 A:middle
games.

00:27:00.696 --> 00:27:02.896 A:middle
And you probably know that money

00:27:02.896 --> 00:27:04.336 A:middle
isn't the answer to that.

00:27:04.336 --> 00:27:06.186 A:middle
Well, nothing in the redesigned

00:27:06.186 --> 00:27:08.516 A:middle
App Store on Today Games or Apps

00:27:08.816 --> 00:27:10.066 A:middle
is advertising.

00:27:10.066 --> 00:27:12.086 A:middle
We are strong experts with an

00:27:12.086 --> 00:27:13.376 A:middle
editorial point of view.

00:27:13.736 --> 00:27:15.306 A:middle
And we are great storytellers

00:27:15.306 --> 00:27:16.836 A:middle
with a personality and with a

00:27:16.836 --> 00:27:18.346 A:middle
perspective that we want to

00:27:18.346 --> 00:27:18.696 A:middle
share.

00:27:18.696 --> 00:27:19.776 A:middle
Now, why is this important?

00:27:20.816 --> 00:27:22.066 A:middle
We want customers to really

00:27:22.066 --> 00:27:23.526 A:middle
trust the recommendations that

00:27:23.526 --> 00:27:23.986 A:middle
we make.

00:27:24.496 --> 00:27:25.876 A:middle
We want them to be able to rely

00:27:25.876 --> 00:27:27.796 A:middle
on what we share with them.

00:27:28.366 --> 00:27:30.056 A:middle
Why? So they'll ultimately come

00:27:30.056 --> 00:27:32.166 A:middle
back every day and find

00:27:32.166 --> 00:27:33.716 A:middle
tremendous value in the App

00:27:33.716 --> 00:27:34.776 A:middle
Store's editorial.

00:27:36.076 --> 00:27:37.856 A:middle
Fourth. While we wordsmith this

00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:38.596 A:middle
a lot, let me tell you.

00:27:38.596 --> 00:27:39.726 A:middle
We tell interesting and

00:27:39.726 --> 00:27:40.556 A:middle
important stories.

00:27:40.556 --> 00:27:41.486 A:middle
First it was, "We tell

00:27:41.486 --> 00:27:42.536 A:middle
interesting stories."

00:27:42.886 --> 00:27:44.696 A:middle
Then it was, "We tell insanely

00:27:44.926 --> 00:27:45.986 A:middle
interesting stories."

00:27:46.196 --> 00:27:47.356 A:middle
And this is where we landed,

00:27:47.416 --> 00:27:48.986 A:middle
"Interesting and important

00:27:48.986 --> 00:27:49.356 A:middle
stories."

00:27:49.356 --> 00:27:51.476 A:middle
Now, for sure, not every single

00:27:51.476 --> 00:27:53.486 A:middle
story on Today is going to be

00:27:53.486 --> 00:27:54.736 A:middle
super, super important.

00:27:55.056 --> 00:27:56.156 A:middle
But we're going to try really,

00:27:56.156 --> 00:27:57.456 A:middle
really hard to make sure that

00:27:57.456 --> 00:27:59.316 A:middle
they are very interesting.

00:27:59.316 --> 00:28:01.466 A:middle
They key for us is that us being

00:28:01.466 --> 00:28:02.636 A:middle
able to say that this app is

00:28:02.636 --> 00:28:04.536 A:middle
great is no longer enough.

00:28:04.996 --> 00:28:06.706 A:middle
In the current app store, that's

00:28:06.706 --> 00:28:07.596 A:middle
what we say.

00:28:07.596 --> 00:28:09.206 A:middle
And we feature and promote those

00:28:09.206 --> 00:28:09.516 A:middle
apps.

00:28:09.906 --> 00:28:11.486 A:middle
In our new design, newly

00:28:11.486 --> 00:28:12.896 A:middle
designed App Store, we will say

00:28:12.896 --> 00:28:14.146 A:middle
that app is great, but then

00:28:14.146 --> 00:28:16.786 A:middle
explain why we believe it is to

00:28:16.786 --> 00:28:17.576 A:middle
our customers.

00:28:17.876 --> 00:28:18.636 A:middle
We're here to provide

00:28:18.736 --> 00:28:20.396 A:middle
thought-provoking ideas and

00:28:20.396 --> 00:28:21.956 A:middle
really offer that context.

00:28:21.956 --> 00:28:25.216 A:middle
Our fifth and last principle is

00:28:25.216 --> 00:28:27.966 A:middle
we deliver a fresh and

00:28:27.966 --> 00:28:29.016 A:middle
unexpected take.

00:28:29.016 --> 00:28:30.326 A:middle
You know, the world of apps is

00:28:30.326 --> 00:28:31.956 A:middle
moving at a ridiculous speed.

00:28:32.406 --> 00:28:34.856 A:middle
It is our job, we believe, to

00:28:34.856 --> 00:28:36.606 A:middle
reflect that innovative culture.

00:28:36.606 --> 00:28:37.876 A:middle
You guys are pushing the world

00:28:37.876 --> 00:28:38.286 A:middle
ahead.

00:28:38.536 --> 00:28:40.146 A:middle
All of you are shaping our lives

00:28:40.436 --> 00:28:41.706 A:middle
with what you create.

00:28:42.156 --> 00:28:44.086 A:middle
And often you've changed things

00:28:44.086 --> 00:28:45.196 A:middle
in ways that are totally

00:28:45.196 --> 00:28:45.876 A:middle
unexpected.

00:28:45.876 --> 00:28:47.266 A:middle
So, we want to try to keep up

00:28:47.266 --> 00:28:47.706 A:middle
with you.

00:28:48.176 --> 00:28:49.626 A:middle
Keep up with that speed.

00:28:49.826 --> 00:28:51.086 A:middle
And for us, we kind of call this

00:28:51.086 --> 00:28:53.196 A:middle
our "the crazy ones" principles.

00:28:53.276 --> 00:28:54.876 A:middle
A fresh and unexpected take.

00:28:55.406 --> 00:28:57.906 A:middle
So these five principles all

00:28:57.906 --> 00:28:59.326 A:middle
together: We celebrate apps.

00:28:59.326 --> 00:29:00.636 A:middle
We are the voice of the App

00:29:00.636 --> 00:29:01.196 A:middle
Store.

00:29:01.496 --> 00:29:03.006 A:middle
We offer independent insights.

00:29:03.006 --> 00:29:03.976 A:middle
We tell interesting and

00:29:03.976 --> 00:29:04.936 A:middle
important stories.

00:29:05.166 --> 00:29:06.306 A:middle
And we deliver a fresh and

00:29:06.306 --> 00:29:07.186 A:middle
unexpected take.

00:29:07.386 --> 00:29:09.786 A:middle
When we do all this, if around

00:29:09.786 --> 00:29:11.506 A:middle
the world we abide by these

00:29:11.546 --> 00:29:13.436 A:middle
principles, then hopefully the

00:29:13.436 --> 00:29:15.066 A:middle
Today tab and the whole new App

00:29:15.066 --> 00:29:16.936 A:middle
Store become a pretty fabulous

00:29:16.936 --> 00:29:18.956 A:middle
document of app culture.

00:29:19.826 --> 00:29:21.246 A:middle
And for us at the App Store, app

00:29:21.276 --> 00:29:22.716 A:middle
culture in almost every single

00:29:22.716 --> 00:29:24.856 A:middle
way is culture.

00:29:25.456 --> 00:29:27.166 A:middle
All right.

00:29:27.266 --> 00:29:29.666 A:middle
The new tabs: Today, Games, and

00:29:29.666 --> 00:29:30.186 A:middle
Apps.

00:29:30.426 --> 00:29:31.806 A:middle
Each of these tabs have the same

00:29:31.806 --> 00:29:32.476 A:middle
goal.

00:29:32.476 --> 00:29:33.996 A:middle
But we approach them

00:29:34.316 --> 00:29:34.836 A:middle
differently.

00:29:35.056 --> 00:29:36.466 A:middle
Today, well, Today is going to

00:29:36.466 --> 00:29:37.416 A:middle
be updated every day.

00:29:37.636 --> 00:29:38.556 A:middle
Don't really have a choice

00:29:38.556 --> 00:29:38.866 A:middle
there.

00:29:38.866 --> 00:29:39.486 A:middle
Hence the name.

00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:42.066 A:middle
It's going to have a very

00:29:42.416 --> 00:29:43.536 A:middle
focused perspective.

00:29:43.536 --> 00:29:45.186 A:middle
It's going to be highly

00:29:45.186 --> 00:29:46.126 A:middle
contextual.

00:29:46.596 --> 00:29:48.326 A:middle
And when customers tap on cards

00:29:48.326 --> 00:29:50.096 A:middle
in Today, they can actually go

00:29:50.096 --> 00:29:52.436 A:middle
directly to buy that app or game

00:29:52.436 --> 00:29:53.126 A:middle
from the card.

00:29:53.376 --> 00:29:55.066 A:middle
Or of course, tap in and read

00:29:55.066 --> 00:29:56.156 A:middle
one of our stories.

00:29:56.936 --> 00:29:58.106 A:middle
The Games and Apps tabs are

00:29:58.106 --> 00:29:58.876 A:middle
going to be different.

00:29:59.126 --> 00:30:00.436 A:middle
In many ways you can think about

00:30:00.436 --> 00:30:03.076 A:middle
those as a 2.0 version or a

00:30:03.076 --> 00:30:04.406 A:middle
newly evolved version of the

00:30:04.406 --> 00:30:06.486 A:middle
Feature tab now, including

00:30:06.486 --> 00:30:08.116 A:middle
categories and including charts,

00:30:08.166 --> 00:30:08.956 A:middle
as you're seeing.

00:30:09.096 --> 00:30:10.186 A:middle
Well, the Games and Apps tabs

00:30:10.186 --> 00:30:11.346 A:middle
are going to be updated often.

00:30:11.636 --> 00:30:12.506 A:middle
Not every day.

00:30:12.956 --> 00:30:14.386 A:middle
But more often than the weekly

00:30:14.386 --> 00:30:16.366 A:middle
that you see in today's cadence.

00:30:16.646 --> 00:30:17.416 A:middle
Games and Apps are going to

00:30:17.416 --> 00:30:18.886 A:middle
offer a broader selection.

00:30:19.076 --> 00:30:20.386 A:middle
And it's generally going to be a

00:30:20.386 --> 00:30:22.006 A:middle
more transactional experience.

00:30:22.006 --> 00:30:23.966 A:middle
Taps on Games and Apps will take

00:30:23.966 --> 00:30:25.746 A:middle
customers directly to our

00:30:25.746 --> 00:30:27.496 A:middle
amazing new product pages.

00:30:29.576 --> 00:30:31.736 A:middle
Well, let me chat a little bit

00:30:31.736 --> 00:30:33.276 A:middle
about what we call our Story

00:30:33.596 --> 00:30:34.256 A:middle
Framework.

00:30:34.256 --> 00:30:35.996 A:middle
As you're seeing, stories on the

00:30:35.996 --> 00:30:37.436 A:middle
App Store will cover many, many

00:30:37.436 --> 00:30:37.926 A:middle
things.

00:30:38.086 --> 00:30:39.216 A:middle
We'll have world premieres.

00:30:39.216 --> 00:30:40.416 A:middle
We'll have major updates.

00:30:40.416 --> 00:30:41.746 A:middle
We'll have tips and tricks and

00:30:41.746 --> 00:30:43.026 A:middle
interviews with developers and

00:30:43.026 --> 00:30:44.086 A:middle
lists upon lists.

00:30:44.446 --> 00:30:46.076 A:middle
Well, our job is to write about

00:30:46.076 --> 00:30:47.056 A:middle
what we think customers will

00:30:47.056 --> 00:30:48.916 A:middle
find most interesting about an

00:30:48.916 --> 00:30:49.466 A:middle
app or a game.

00:30:49.466 --> 00:30:50.866 A:middle
And we really believe every app

00:30:50.866 --> 00:30:52.136 A:middle
has a story to tell.

00:30:53.386 --> 00:30:54.626 A:middle
There are four main topics of

00:30:54.626 --> 00:30:55.766 A:middle
stories for us.

00:30:56.176 --> 00:30:57.256 A:middle
When we think about all the

00:30:57.256 --> 00:30:58.806 A:middle
range, the broad, broad range of

00:30:58.806 --> 00:31:00.366 A:middle
ideas that we have, we try to

00:31:00.366 --> 00:31:02.426 A:middle
make -- we needed to make sense

00:31:02.426 --> 00:31:02.736 A:middle
of that.

00:31:02.736 --> 00:31:04.086 A:middle
So we started with just an idea

00:31:04.086 --> 00:31:04.726 A:middle
of topics.

00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:06.576 A:middle
What are the four main topics

00:31:06.576 --> 00:31:07.316 A:middle
that we will cover?

00:31:07.746 --> 00:31:09.386 A:middle
And for each topic we kind of

00:31:09.386 --> 00:31:10.526 A:middle
have a statement of belief.

00:31:11.026 --> 00:31:12.246 A:middle
This is something that we really

00:31:12.786 --> 00:31:15.246 A:middle
want to have customers feel in

00:31:15.246 --> 00:31:16.456 A:middle
the writing and the content that

00:31:16.456 --> 00:31:17.046 A:middle
we create.

00:31:17.046 --> 00:31:18.456 A:middle
Our first topic is, of course,

00:31:18.906 --> 00:31:19.506 A:middle
gaming.

00:31:19.746 --> 00:31:21.316 A:middle
Whether it's a big name game or

00:31:21.316 --> 00:31:22.376 A:middle
a small indie who has a

00:31:22.376 --> 00:31:23.856 A:middle
car-based strategy, RPG,

00:31:23.856 --> 00:31:25.616 A:middle
Infinite Runner, it doesn't

00:31:25.616 --> 00:31:25.866 A:middle
matter.

00:31:25.866 --> 00:31:26.976 A:middle
The games you make are so

00:31:26.976 --> 00:31:29.636 A:middle
innovative and so creative, our

00:31:29.636 --> 00:31:30.916 A:middle
game editors really believe

00:31:30.916 --> 00:31:31.346 A:middle
that, you know what?

00:31:31.346 --> 00:31:32.526 A:middle
Apps are the future of gaming.

00:31:32.726 --> 00:31:34.146 A:middle
In many ways apps are the

00:31:34.496 --> 00:31:35.566 A:middle
present of gaming.

00:31:35.726 --> 00:31:37.086 A:middle
Anyone agree with that comment?

00:31:37.086 --> 00:31:38.416 A:middle
Apps are the present of gaming?

00:31:39.876 --> 00:31:40.816 A:middle
Hey, we do have the biggest

00:31:40.816 --> 00:31:42.126 A:middle
gaming platform in the world.

00:31:42.126 --> 00:31:43.106 A:middle
And you know, we're very

00:31:43.106 --> 00:31:45.226 A:middle
enthusiastic about expressing to

00:31:45.226 --> 00:31:46.596 A:middle
our customers what we believe

00:31:46.736 --> 00:31:48.426 A:middle
the future is in games.

00:31:48.426 --> 00:31:51.016 A:middle
Our second topic: Lifestyle.

00:31:51.016 --> 00:31:52.036 A:middle
Well, what do we believe there?

00:31:52.036 --> 00:31:53.326 A:middle
Apps transform your life.

00:31:53.556 --> 00:31:54.726 A:middle
Whether it's social networking

00:31:54.726 --> 00:31:55.516 A:middle
or photography.

00:31:55.516 --> 00:31:56.686 A:middle
Whether it's dating or fitness

00:31:56.686 --> 00:31:58.556 A:middle
or cooking or transportation,

00:31:58.916 --> 00:32:01.136 A:middle
apps have helped us live in ways

00:32:01.136 --> 00:32:02.206 A:middle
that we've never, ever, ever

00:32:02.206 --> 00:32:03.046 A:middle
thought possible.

00:32:03.136 --> 00:32:04.636 A:middle
And we believe in our lifestyle

00:32:04.636 --> 00:32:06.336 A:middle
coverage that apps transform

00:32:06.586 --> 00:32:06.976 A:middle
your life.

00:32:08.066 --> 00:32:08.936 A:middle
Third, culture and

00:32:08.936 --> 00:32:09.426 A:middle
entertainment.

00:32:09.426 --> 00:32:10.796 A:middle
Apps shape culture.

00:32:10.796 --> 00:32:12.026 A:middle
Well, this is music, film,

00:32:12.026 --> 00:32:12.576 A:middle
fashion.

00:32:12.576 --> 00:32:14.366 A:middle
This is TV, pop culture and

00:32:14.366 --> 00:32:15.936 A:middle
everything in between.

00:32:16.256 --> 00:32:17.426 A:middle
The App Store is going to bring

00:32:17.426 --> 00:32:18.456 A:middle
all that together.

00:32:18.986 --> 00:32:20.276 A:middle
And so App Store [inaudible]

00:32:20.276 --> 00:32:22.296 A:middle
content may talk to celebrities.

00:32:22.576 --> 00:32:24.076 A:middle
We may talk to influencers.

00:32:24.196 --> 00:32:25.736 A:middle
We may talk to culture creators

00:32:25.736 --> 00:32:28.286 A:middle
of all kinds about the world of

00:32:28.286 --> 00:32:29.806 A:middle
apps and games because we

00:32:29.806 --> 00:32:31.626 A:middle
believe apps really do shape

00:32:31.626 --> 00:32:32.036 A:middle
culture.

00:32:32.786 --> 00:32:34.356 A:middle
And our fourth and final topic

00:32:34.356 --> 00:32:36.166 A:middle
is, of course, new tech and

00:32:36.166 --> 00:32:36.766 A:middle
innovation.

00:32:36.766 --> 00:32:38.096 A:middle
This is all things new, new,

00:32:38.096 --> 00:32:38.526 A:middle
new.

00:32:38.746 --> 00:32:39.546 A:middle
New services.

00:32:39.546 --> 00:32:40.326 A:middle
New ideas.

00:32:40.326 --> 00:32:41.356 A:middle
New capabilities.

00:32:41.666 --> 00:32:42.926 A:middle
Completely new ways of getting

00:32:42.926 --> 00:32:44.336 A:middle
things done with your iPhone or

00:32:44.336 --> 00:32:44.736 A:middle
iPad.

00:32:45.106 --> 00:32:46.516 A:middle
And we really feel that we can

00:32:46.516 --> 00:32:48.016 A:middle
provide a service to customers

00:32:48.246 --> 00:32:49.986 A:middle
to help them figure it all out.

00:32:50.296 --> 00:32:51.556 A:middle
Help them get great use out of

00:32:51.556 --> 00:32:52.856 A:middle
all the innovative work that you

00:32:52.856 --> 00:32:53.236 A:middle
do.

00:32:53.506 --> 00:32:54.836 A:middle
And help them potentially be

00:32:54.836 --> 00:32:57.056 A:middle
introduced into a whole new way

00:32:57.416 --> 00:32:58.276 A:middle
of doing things.

00:32:58.606 --> 00:33:00.026 A:middle
In many ways it's very Apple of

00:33:00.026 --> 00:33:00.286 A:middle
us.

00:33:00.286 --> 00:33:01.476 A:middle
We want to make the complex

00:33:01.476 --> 00:33:03.466 A:middle
world of technology simple.

00:33:04.416 --> 00:33:05.066 A:middle
All right.

00:33:05.066 --> 00:33:06.576 A:middle
Four topics: Gaming, lifestyle,

00:33:06.576 --> 00:33:07.736 A:middle
culture and entertainment, and

00:33:07.736 --> 00:33:08.896 A:middle
new tech and innovation.

00:33:09.256 --> 00:33:10.546 A:middle
When we take these topics, and

00:33:10.546 --> 00:33:12.456 A:middle
once we've decided on one, then

00:33:12.456 --> 00:33:14.056 A:middle
we want to apply what we call an

00:33:14.056 --> 00:33:14.836 A:middle
"intention."

00:33:14.836 --> 00:33:15.726 A:middle
And this is essentially the

00:33:15.726 --> 00:33:17.286 A:middle
purpose or the goal of each

00:33:17.286 --> 00:33:18.966 A:middle
story that you will see on the

00:33:18.966 --> 00:33:19.436 A:middle
App Store.

00:33:19.436 --> 00:33:20.376 A:middle
There are three of those.

00:33:20.746 --> 00:33:22.236 A:middle
The first we call "Inform."

00:33:22.636 --> 00:33:24.056 A:middle
This is about being timely.

00:33:24.356 --> 00:33:25.616 A:middle
This is about giving customers

00:33:25.616 --> 00:33:27.006 A:middle
"need-to-know" information.

00:33:27.246 --> 00:33:28.676 A:middle
This is to obviously let them

00:33:28.676 --> 00:33:29.736 A:middle
know what's happening in the

00:33:29.736 --> 00:33:31.086 A:middle
world right now.

00:33:31.316 --> 00:33:33.116 A:middle
For example, you can say a new

00:33:33.116 --> 00:33:34.826 A:middle
show is launching on Netflix.

00:33:34.826 --> 00:33:36.106 A:middle
And if we do that well, our

00:33:36.926 --> 00:33:38.186 A:middle
customer reaction may very

00:33:38.186 --> 00:33:39.456 A:middle
likely be: "Cool.

00:33:39.636 --> 00:33:41.746 A:middle
I want to get that."

00:33:41.746 --> 00:33:43.306 A:middle
Our second intention is simply

00:33:43.306 --> 00:33:44.046 A:middle
called "Help."

00:33:44.436 --> 00:33:45.666 A:middle
Really, really important for us.

00:33:45.666 --> 00:33:46.396 A:middle
This is about being

00:33:46.396 --> 00:33:47.096 A:middle
instructional.

00:33:47.096 --> 00:33:47.806 A:middle
This is about being

00:33:47.806 --> 00:33:48.526 A:middle
motivational.

00:33:48.926 --> 00:33:50.466 A:middle
This is about sharing ideas that

00:33:50.466 --> 00:33:52.556 A:middle
may be intuitive for us but not

00:33:52.556 --> 00:33:54.306 A:middle
for all of our customers.

00:33:54.556 --> 00:33:55.516 A:middle
How to get the most out of

00:33:55.516 --> 00:33:57.066 A:middle
Instagram's new feature could be

00:33:57.316 --> 00:33:58.176 A:middle
a helpful topic.

00:33:58.816 --> 00:34:00.886 A:middle
And for us, this can be a really

00:34:00.886 --> 00:34:03.126 A:middle
helpful way of reengaging our

00:34:03.126 --> 00:34:04.346 A:middle
customers with some apps that

00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:05.986 A:middle
they may have downloaded, may

00:34:05.986 --> 00:34:07.476 A:middle
knew they loved them, but

00:34:07.746 --> 00:34:08.866 A:middle
they've been left idle.

00:34:09.076 --> 00:34:10.356 A:middle
So how can we reengage our

00:34:10.356 --> 00:34:11.546 A:middle
customers with some of those

00:34:11.546 --> 00:34:13.556 A:middle
apps and even games by helping

00:34:13.556 --> 00:34:15.146 A:middle
them, giving them new ideas of

00:34:15.146 --> 00:34:17.116 A:middle
how to use one of these great

00:34:17.116 --> 00:34:17.546 A:middle
things?

00:34:18.636 --> 00:34:20.286 A:middle
And third, it's "Inspire."

00:34:20.706 --> 00:34:22.006 A:middle
This is going to be the topic

00:34:22.006 --> 00:34:23.886 A:middle
area or the intention where we

00:34:23.886 --> 00:34:25.486 A:middle
have really creative content,

00:34:25.816 --> 00:34:27.226 A:middle
really motivational content,

00:34:27.226 --> 00:34:27.986 A:middle
really insightful.

00:34:27.986 --> 00:34:28.816 A:middle
This is going to be everything

00:34:28.816 --> 00:34:29.976 A:middle
from a twelve-year-old making an

00:34:29.976 --> 00:34:31.606 A:middle
app to the 82-year-old making an

00:34:31.606 --> 00:34:33.806 A:middle
app, both of whom were here this

00:34:33.806 --> 00:34:34.226 A:middle
year.

00:34:34.446 --> 00:34:36.526 A:middle
This is inspiring content that

00:34:36.526 --> 00:34:39.006 A:middle
may go global around the world.

00:34:39.396 --> 00:34:41.676 A:middle
Inform, help and inspire.

00:34:41.866 --> 00:34:43.466 A:middle
If we inform, "Cool.

00:34:43.466 --> 00:34:44.416 A:middle
I want to get that."

00:34:44.416 --> 00:34:46.236 A:middle
If we help, "I had no idea.

00:34:46.236 --> 00:34:47.996 A:middle
Thanks." And if we inspire,

00:34:47.996 --> 00:34:48.546 A:middle
"Wow!

00:34:48.856 --> 00:34:49.876 A:middle
That's super interesting."

00:34:49.876 --> 00:34:51.046 A:middle
And of course, we are not going

00:34:51.046 --> 00:34:52.406 A:middle
to count any of those reactions

00:34:52.406 --> 00:34:54.076 A:middle
unless customers use those exact

00:34:54.246 --> 00:34:56.086 A:middle
phrases on the screen.

00:34:58.086 --> 00:34:59.776 A:middle
Let's see how this all comes

00:34:59.776 --> 00:35:00.086 A:middle
together.

00:35:00.086 --> 00:35:00.496 A:middle
All right.

00:35:00.776 --> 00:35:02.406 A:middle
Our first world premiere ever,

00:35:02.406 --> 00:35:03.926 A:middle
ever, ever is "The Art of the

00:35:03.926 --> 00:35:04.706 A:middle
Impossible.

00:35:04.986 --> 00:35:06.756 A:middle
Inside the extraordinary world

00:35:07.106 --> 00:35:08.376 A:middle
of Monument Valley 2."

00:35:08.376 --> 00:35:09.726 A:middle
Well, why did we choose this?

00:35:10.466 --> 00:35:11.606 A:middle
First and foremost, it comes

00:35:11.606 --> 00:35:12.946 A:middle
back to our first principle,

00:35:12.946 --> 00:35:14.476 A:middle
which was Monument Valley 2 is

00:35:14.476 --> 00:35:15.836 A:middle
an awesome, awesome game.

00:35:15.836 --> 00:35:17.026 A:middle
How many folks have tried it so

00:35:17.026 --> 00:35:17.376 A:middle
far?

00:35:17.966 --> 00:35:19.546 A:middle
Since Monday release.

00:35:20.076 --> 00:35:21.476 A:middle
I can say I have not even got

00:35:21.476 --> 00:35:22.166 A:middle
very far.

00:35:22.496 --> 00:35:23.846 A:middle
But it's a phenomenal,

00:35:23.846 --> 00:35:24.846 A:middle
phenomenal game.

00:35:25.176 --> 00:35:27.056 A:middle
And Ustwo did a great job with

00:35:27.056 --> 00:35:27.226 A:middle
this.

00:35:27.226 --> 00:35:28.846 A:middle
So first and foremost, we chose

00:35:28.846 --> 00:35:30.226 A:middle
Monument Valley 2 as our world

00:35:30.226 --> 00:35:31.776 A:middle
premiere because the game is

00:35:31.836 --> 00:35:32.836 A:middle
flat our awesome.

00:35:33.246 --> 00:35:35.436 A:middle
Secondly, the Ustwo team gave us

00:35:35.436 --> 00:35:36.946 A:middle
great access to their

00:35:36.946 --> 00:35:38.016 A:middle
development process.

00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:39.436 A:middle
They allowed us in and we got to

00:35:39.436 --> 00:35:40.066 A:middle
meet with some of their

00:35:40.066 --> 00:35:41.256 A:middle
creatives and speak to some of

00:35:41.256 --> 00:35:42.366 A:middle
their art directors about what

00:35:42.366 --> 00:35:44.176 A:middle
inspired them to make Monument

00:35:44.176 --> 00:35:44.846 A:middle
Valley 2.

00:35:45.086 --> 00:35:46.406 A:middle
That was really interesting and

00:35:46.406 --> 00:35:47.706 A:middle
exciting for us because we knew

00:35:47.706 --> 00:35:49.416 A:middle
we could tell that story, then,

00:35:49.416 --> 00:35:50.226 A:middle
to customers.

00:35:50.656 --> 00:35:52.246 A:middle
And thirdly, we knew we had a

00:35:52.246 --> 00:35:53.866 A:middle
great story for customers about

00:35:53.866 --> 00:35:54.886 A:middle
Monument Valley 2.

00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:56.336 A:middle
And of course it helped that it

00:35:56.336 --> 00:35:58.476 A:middle
was only available on iOS.

00:35:59.526 --> 00:36:01.536 A:middle
All right.

00:36:01.596 --> 00:36:02.626 A:middle
There's a moment in the third

00:36:02.626 --> 00:36:03.936 A:middle
stage of Monument Valley 2 when

00:36:03.936 --> 00:36:05.276 A:middle
a landslide separates mother

00:36:05.276 --> 00:36:05.756 A:middle
from child.

00:36:05.756 --> 00:36:06.726 A:middle
I actually did get to this

00:36:06.726 --> 00:36:07.056 A:middle
level.

00:36:07.446 --> 00:36:09.796 A:middle
To get her little one back, mom

00:36:09.876 --> 00:36:11.226 A:middle
must navigate through intricate,

00:36:11.226 --> 00:36:13.386 A:middle
artfully-crafted puzzle that

00:36:13.386 --> 00:36:14.886 A:middle
constantly evolves.

00:36:15.026 --> 00:36:16.606 A:middle
There was an actual moment, I

00:36:16.606 --> 00:36:17.846 A:middle
got to it later, but one of our

00:36:17.846 --> 00:36:19.096 A:middle
game editors, this really

00:36:19.376 --> 00:36:19.966 A:middle
happened to him.

00:36:19.966 --> 00:36:20.836 A:middle
He was playing and it's like "Oh

00:36:20.836 --> 00:36:21.086 A:middle
my God.

00:36:21.086 --> 00:36:22.246 A:middle
It was such an awesome moment."

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:23.226 A:middle
Then they embrace after.

00:36:23.226 --> 00:36:24.466 A:middle
And it really kind of moved him.

00:36:24.466 --> 00:36:25.666 A:middle
And we said, "You know what?

00:36:25.666 --> 00:36:27.406 A:middle
That's the intro to our Monument

00:36:27.406 --> 00:36:28.456 A:middle
Valley 2 story."

00:36:29.416 --> 00:36:30.506 A:middle
We've seen some of the beautiful

00:36:30.506 --> 00:36:31.096 A:middle
designs.

00:36:31.326 --> 00:36:33.006 A:middle
We've seen how the copy flows in

00:36:33.006 --> 00:36:34.946 A:middle
between these great images and

00:36:34.946 --> 00:36:35.956 A:middle
in-line video.

00:36:36.156 --> 00:36:37.166 A:middle
And of course, we have pull

00:36:37.166 --> 00:36:37.626 A:middle
quotes.

00:36:37.626 --> 00:36:39.446 A:middle
Apple didn't invent pull quotes,

00:36:39.446 --> 00:36:40.916 A:middle
but it's really nice to see them

00:36:41.266 --> 00:36:42.556 A:middle
on the App Store.

00:36:42.556 --> 00:36:44.276 A:middle
Here we quoted us to studio head

00:36:44.276 --> 00:36:45.956 A:middle
Dan Gray, who wants to change

00:36:45.956 --> 00:36:47.226 A:middle
people's perceptions of what

00:36:47.226 --> 00:36:48.516 A:middle
games can be.

00:36:48.796 --> 00:36:50.436 A:middle
That's our first world premiere

00:36:50.796 --> 00:36:52.456 A:middle
of Monument Valley 2.

00:36:52.836 --> 00:36:54.406 A:middle
Here is our first How To column.

00:36:54.406 --> 00:36:55.836 A:middle
Monika spoke about a little bit

00:36:56.266 --> 00:36:56.766 A:middle
earlier.

00:36:56.766 --> 00:36:57.176 A:middle
And you know what?

00:36:57.176 --> 00:36:58.746 A:middle
There are many, many ways we

00:36:58.746 --> 00:37:00.826 A:middle
could have spoken about VSCO.

00:37:01.016 --> 00:37:02.166 A:middle
It's one of our favorite apps

00:37:02.166 --> 00:37:03.146 A:middle
and one of our favorite photo

00:37:03.146 --> 00:37:04.596 A:middle
filter apps for a long, long

00:37:04.596 --> 00:37:05.016 A:middle
time.

00:37:05.576 --> 00:37:07.426 A:middle
And here we wanted to -- we felt

00:37:07.426 --> 00:37:09.106 A:middle
the most helpful angle would be

00:37:09.106 --> 00:37:11.056 A:middle
kind of a basic primer of some

00:37:11.056 --> 00:37:13.356 A:middle
of the new features of VSCO that

00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:14.866 A:middle
many customers may not have used

00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:15.146 A:middle
yet.

00:37:15.836 --> 00:37:17.046 A:middle
Well, let's look at some of

00:37:17.386 --> 00:37:18.006 A:middle
them.

00:37:18.686 --> 00:37:19.606 A:middle
Don't fall on stage.

00:37:20.396 --> 00:37:21.806 A:middle
Like a good denim jacket -- it's

00:37:21.806 --> 00:37:23.046 A:middle
funny, we had this image.

00:37:23.406 --> 00:37:25.016 A:middle
It was initially the phrase is

00:37:25.016 --> 00:37:26.176 A:middle
often "like a good leather

00:37:26.176 --> 00:37:26.676 A:middle
jacket."

00:37:26.936 --> 00:37:28.166 A:middle
We changed it to "like a good

00:37:28.166 --> 00:37:28.766 A:middle
denim jacket."

00:37:28.766 --> 00:37:29.866 A:middle
How many people love the denim

00:37:29.866 --> 00:37:31.626 A:middle
jacket that we gave out WWDC

00:37:31.626 --> 00:37:32.586 A:middle
Swag this year?

00:37:32.946 --> 00:37:34.126 A:middle
So I'm glad, actually.

00:37:34.366 --> 00:37:35.546 A:middle
Round of applause for the denim

00:37:35.546 --> 00:37:35.966 A:middle
jackets.

00:37:36.016 --> 00:37:37.516 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:37:37.516 --> 00:37:38.556 A:middle
Well here you are right here.

00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:40.156 A:middle
Like a good denim jacket.

00:37:40.156 --> 00:37:41.556 A:middle
VSCO's got a coolness factor

00:37:41.556 --> 00:37:42.846 A:middle
that can't be measured.

00:37:43.466 --> 00:37:44.366 A:middle
All right, we wanted to talk

00:37:44.366 --> 00:37:45.466 A:middle
about creating gifts.

00:37:45.546 --> 00:37:47.306 A:middle
Many folks don't know that you

00:37:47.306 --> 00:37:49.156 A:middle
can create gifts in VSCO.

00:37:49.156 --> 00:37:51.686 A:middle
It's a feature that many users,

00:37:51.686 --> 00:37:53.466 A:middle
both amateur and pro, love to

00:37:53.466 --> 00:37:53.946 A:middle
see.

00:37:54.136 --> 00:37:55.106 A:middle
That was number one.

00:37:55.476 --> 00:37:56.986 A:middle
We go now, we can make journals

00:37:56.986 --> 00:37:57.516 A:middle
of VSCO.

00:37:57.516 --> 00:37:59.116 A:middle
We talk about some of their free

00:37:59.326 --> 00:37:59.946 A:middle
filters.

00:38:00.176 --> 00:38:01.916 A:middle
And of course, we end here with

00:38:01.916 --> 00:38:03.456 A:middle
the kind of hidden, if you will,

00:38:03.616 --> 00:38:04.926 A:middle
social network that's within

00:38:04.926 --> 00:38:05.376 A:middle
VSCO.

00:38:05.596 --> 00:38:06.646 A:middle
Tip number five, you can

00:38:06.646 --> 00:38:08.146 A:middle
socialize without having to go

00:38:08.146 --> 00:38:08.896 A:middle
anywhere else.

00:38:09.116 --> 00:38:11.096 A:middle
So this was our first How To

00:38:11.096 --> 00:38:11.546 A:middle
story.

00:38:13.196 --> 00:38:15.116 A:middle
This is very interesting because

00:38:15.116 --> 00:38:16.546 A:middle
one of the biggest challenges

00:38:16.546 --> 00:38:18.756 A:middle
about App Store Editorial is how

00:38:18.756 --> 00:38:21.096 A:middle
can we serve a billion people

00:38:21.096 --> 00:38:22.136 A:middle
with perspective?

00:38:22.686 --> 00:38:24.176 A:middle
That's really, really, really

00:38:24.296 --> 00:38:24.696 A:middle
hard.

00:38:25.476 --> 00:38:26.666 A:middle
Well, you have to figure out

00:38:26.666 --> 00:38:27.886 A:middle
first who you want to speak to.

00:38:28.606 --> 00:38:30.016 A:middle
And it's as important to us on

00:38:30.016 --> 00:38:31.186 A:middle
the App Store to talk to new

00:38:31.186 --> 00:38:33.556 A:middle
users as it is to talk to

00:38:33.776 --> 00:38:34.636 A:middle
advanced users.

00:38:34.636 --> 00:38:36.196 A:middle
So this is column is more for an

00:38:36.196 --> 00:38:37.076 A:middle
advanced user.

00:38:37.356 --> 00:38:38.596 A:middle
We call this a Deep Dive.

00:38:38.796 --> 00:38:40.326 A:middle
Here's it's a conversation about

00:38:40.326 --> 00:38:41.046 A:middle
causality.

00:38:41.406 --> 00:38:42.756 A:middle
One of my game editors was

00:38:42.756 --> 00:38:44.196 A:middle
really excited when he got to

00:38:44.196 --> 00:38:46.116 A:middle
level 201 because everything

00:38:46.116 --> 00:38:48.996 A:middle
changes on level 201.

00:38:49.226 --> 00:38:50.486 A:middle
You want to feel like a genius,

00:38:50.486 --> 00:38:51.756 A:middle
well, you better get there

00:38:51.986 --> 00:38:52.306 A:middle
first.

00:38:52.306 --> 00:38:54.106 A:middle
So this was a story about a

00:38:54.106 --> 00:38:56.126 A:middle
great game in a kind of deeper

00:38:56.466 --> 00:38:57.046 A:middle
context.

00:38:57.456 --> 00:38:58.356 A:middle
We talk about culture and

00:38:58.356 --> 00:38:59.376 A:middle
entertainment, all right?

00:38:59.376 --> 00:39:00.356 A:middle
It's the NBA finals.

00:39:00.356 --> 00:39:01.596 A:middle
We know that game is on tonight.

00:39:01.676 --> 00:39:02.786 A:middle
Go Warriors!

00:39:02.786 --> 00:39:04.236 A:middle
I better not say anything else

00:39:04.236 --> 00:39:05.876 A:middle
in San Jose, California.

00:39:06.246 --> 00:39:07.026 A:middle
Go Warriors.

00:39:07.026 --> 00:39:08.416 A:middle
And when you look at culture and

00:39:08.416 --> 00:39:09.686 A:middle
entertainment through the lens

00:39:09.686 --> 00:39:11.696 A:middle
of apps, there are two actual

00:39:11.696 --> 00:39:12.876 A:middle
ways that you can enjoy it.

00:39:13.186 --> 00:39:14.536 A:middle
Of course, you can watch the

00:39:14.536 --> 00:39:16.716 A:middle
game live anywhere you are on

00:39:16.716 --> 00:39:17.096 A:middle
ESPN.

00:39:17.596 --> 00:39:19.016 A:middle
But you can also play the game

00:39:19.246 --> 00:39:20.346 A:middle
on NBA Live.

00:39:20.346 --> 00:39:21.756 A:middle
And you can imitate Steph Curry

00:39:21.756 --> 00:39:23.036 A:middle
or LeBron or whoever you'd like

00:39:23.036 --> 00:39:25.526 A:middle
to be on the game itself.

00:39:25.616 --> 00:39:27.326 A:middle
In many ways the game is

00:39:27.326 --> 00:39:28.926 A:middle
probably going to be as good as

00:39:28.926 --> 00:39:30.226 A:middle
-- the video game is going to

00:39:30.226 --> 00:39:32.156 A:middle
imitate the real-life game and

00:39:32.156 --> 00:39:33.946 A:middle
back and forth, seeing how these

00:39:33.946 --> 00:39:34.996 A:middle
players are breaking all these

00:39:34.996 --> 00:39:35.926 A:middle
records these days.

00:39:35.926 --> 00:39:37.316 A:middle
So that's our culture and

00:39:37.316 --> 00:39:38.236 A:middle
entertainment story.

00:39:38.656 --> 00:39:40.316 A:middle
A couple of examples.

00:39:40.886 --> 00:39:42.086 A:middle
If there's one thing this

00:39:42.086 --> 00:39:43.416 A:middle
morning I love all of you to

00:39:43.416 --> 00:39:45.286 A:middle
leave here and remember about

00:39:45.286 --> 00:39:46.446 A:middle
the all new App Store is that

00:39:46.446 --> 00:39:48.436 A:middle
there are more ways to be

00:39:48.436 --> 00:39:50.936 A:middle
featured than ever, ever before.

00:39:51.386 --> 00:39:52.376 A:middle
We talked about "Meet the

00:39:52.376 --> 00:39:52.816 A:middle
Developer."

00:39:52.816 --> 00:39:53.366 A:middle
Well, yes.

00:39:53.366 --> 00:39:54.136 A:middle
You can get interviewed.

00:39:54.136 --> 00:39:55.316 A:middle
Our debut "Meet the Developer"

00:39:55.316 --> 00:39:57.356 A:middle
piece featured Michelle Kennedy,

00:39:57.356 --> 00:39:58.576 A:middle
the creator of a wonderful new

00:39:58.576 --> 00:40:00.056 A:middle
social media app called Peanut,

00:40:00.396 --> 00:40:01.736 A:middle
which is dedicated to moms.

00:40:02.126 --> 00:40:03.386 A:middle
It's our "Meet the Developer"

00:40:03.386 --> 00:40:03.966 A:middle
column.

00:40:04.306 --> 00:40:05.246 A:middle
We talked to her about many

00:40:05.246 --> 00:40:06.766 A:middle
things, about her UI and some of

00:40:06.766 --> 00:40:07.856 A:middle
the feature innovations.

00:40:08.016 --> 00:40:09.296 A:middle
And we talked to her about some

00:40:09.296 --> 00:40:10.576 A:middle
of the feedback she's received

00:40:10.856 --> 00:40:12.856 A:middle
from her Peanut social media app

00:40:13.166 --> 00:40:14.696 A:middle
and who it's for.

00:40:15.016 --> 00:40:16.616 A:middle
So we're really excited to have

00:40:16.616 --> 00:40:17.876 A:middle
a kind of deeper cultural

00:40:17.876 --> 00:40:19.646 A:middle
conversation about an app that's

00:40:19.646 --> 00:40:21.046 A:middle
really meaningful to a lot of

00:40:21.046 --> 00:40:21.576 A:middle
folks.

00:40:22.576 --> 00:40:25.026 A:middle
"Peanut is human interaction in

00:40:25.026 --> 00:40:26.576 A:middle
real life, facilitated by

00:40:26.856 --> 00:40:28.516 A:middle
technology," Michelle said.

00:40:29.466 --> 00:40:30.456 A:middle
Another way you can get featured

00:40:30.456 --> 00:40:31.876 A:middle
is, of course, App of the Day.

00:40:31.876 --> 00:40:33.616 A:middle
Here we chose Hit List.

00:40:34.286 --> 00:40:35.936 A:middle
Game of the Day, Super Senso.

00:40:35.936 --> 00:40:37.656 A:middle
Strategic sci-fi combat.

00:40:37.656 --> 00:40:38.636 A:middle
Let me pause for a second and

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:40.026 A:middle
talk about App of the Day and

00:40:40.026 --> 00:40:40.626 A:middle
Game of the Day.

00:40:41.056 --> 00:40:43.526 A:middle
We still have Editor's Choice

00:40:43.526 --> 00:40:44.106 A:middle
for sure.

00:40:44.106 --> 00:40:45.326 A:middle
In fact, Editor's Choice is now

00:40:45.326 --> 00:40:47.006 A:middle
a badge on our new product

00:40:47.006 --> 00:40:47.386 A:middle
pages.

00:40:47.586 --> 00:40:48.786 A:middle
App of the Day and Game of the

00:40:48.786 --> 00:40:50.776 A:middle
Day give us a third option of

00:40:50.776 --> 00:40:52.316 A:middle
really honoring all the great

00:40:52.316 --> 00:40:52.886 A:middle
work you do.

00:40:53.146 --> 00:40:54.346 A:middle
Think of Editor's Choice like

00:40:54.346 --> 00:40:55.166 A:middle
our Oscars.

00:40:55.536 --> 00:40:56.836 A:middle
Like our Best Picture, if you

00:40:56.836 --> 00:40:57.186 A:middle
will.

00:40:57.186 --> 00:40:58.476 A:middle
App of the Day and Game of the

00:40:58.476 --> 00:40:59.336 A:middle
Day are going to be similarly

00:40:59.396 --> 00:41:00.796 A:middle
high quality, super awesome

00:41:00.796 --> 00:41:02.536 A:middle
apps, but they'll also be pegged

00:41:02.766 --> 00:41:04.826 A:middle
to a story that we may want to

00:41:04.826 --> 00:41:05.066 A:middle
tell.

00:41:05.766 --> 00:41:06.816 A:middle
Another way to be featured is

00:41:06.816 --> 00:41:07.276 A:middle
Collections.

00:41:07.276 --> 00:41:08.036 A:middle
Collections are going to be on

00:41:08.036 --> 00:41:09.086 A:middle
the Games and Apps tab.

00:41:09.496 --> 00:41:11.046 A:middle
They are also going to be here

00:41:11.046 --> 00:41:13.176 A:middle
on Today with a cool new design.

00:41:13.836 --> 00:41:15.256 A:middle
You will see here that Heroes,

00:41:15.256 --> 00:41:17.136 A:middle
what we call Heroes on the Apps

00:41:17.136 --> 00:41:17.486 A:middle
tab.

00:41:17.486 --> 00:41:19.036 A:middle
Here we have AirBNB to

00:41:19.096 --> 00:41:20.436 A:middle
rediscover this.

00:41:20.696 --> 00:41:22.546 A:middle
And we have Injustice 2 as a new

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:25.146 A:middle
game in the Games tab.

00:41:25.296 --> 00:41:26.666 A:middle
Another way to be featured is

00:41:26.666 --> 00:41:28.486 A:middle
lists, lists and more lists.

00:41:28.656 --> 00:41:30.846 A:middle
Our debut one is "15 Inspired

00:41:30.846 --> 00:41:31.546 A:middle
Indie Games."

00:41:31.806 --> 00:41:33.336 A:middle
Customers irrespective of the

00:41:33.336 --> 00:41:35.296 A:middle
media love lists.

00:41:35.296 --> 00:41:36.926 A:middle
And we love them as well on the

00:41:36.926 --> 00:41:38.666 A:middle
App Store as well.

00:41:39.336 --> 00:41:40.056 A:middle
All right.

00:41:40.366 --> 00:41:41.476 A:middle
This brings us to the end.

00:41:41.936 --> 00:41:43.136 A:middle
The big, big question.

00:41:43.466 --> 00:41:44.906 A:middle
I hope you've enjoyed our kind

00:41:44.906 --> 00:41:46.456 A:middle
of editorial vision.

00:41:46.936 --> 00:41:48.626 A:middle
It really is a marriage of

00:41:48.626 --> 00:41:51.396 A:middle
expert curation with this idea

00:41:51.396 --> 00:41:53.316 A:middle
of engaging stories and content

00:41:53.436 --> 00:41:54.556 A:middle
for our customers.

00:41:56.396 --> 00:41:57.616 A:middle
But really all we want to know

00:41:57.616 --> 00:41:59.076 A:middle
is this: How do you reach us?

00:41:59.506 --> 00:42:01.886 A:middle
Well, I'm happy to announce, and

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:03.086 A:middle
many of you, many have already

00:42:03.086 --> 00:42:03.566 A:middle
seen it.

00:42:03.816 --> 00:42:04.966 A:middle
But I'm happy to announce that

00:42:04.966 --> 00:42:07.536 A:middle
on AppStore.com/promote, that

00:42:07.536 --> 00:42:08.796 A:middle
will redirect to the new

00:42:08.796 --> 00:42:10.696 A:middle
Developer page where not only

00:42:10.696 --> 00:42:13.276 A:middle
will we ask you about your app

00:42:13.346 --> 00:42:14.806 A:middle
and your game and the features

00:42:14.806 --> 00:42:15.706 A:middle
and what's cool about it.

00:42:15.706 --> 00:42:17.756 A:middle
We'll also have a new area where

00:42:17.756 --> 00:42:19.276 A:middle
it says, "Tell us your story."

00:42:19.276 --> 00:42:20.886 A:middle
We're really, really excited to

00:42:20.886 --> 00:42:22.756 A:middle
hear all of the stories you have

00:42:22.756 --> 00:42:24.256 A:middle
to share with us about your

00:42:24.256 --> 00:42:25.866 A:middle
creative process and what you

00:42:25.866 --> 00:42:26.556 A:middle
want to share with your

00:42:26.556 --> 00:42:28.496 A:middle
customers about apps and games.

00:42:28.756 --> 00:42:30.056 A:middle
So thank you so much.

00:42:30.056 --> 00:42:31.536 A:middle
We're really excited to be on

00:42:31.536 --> 00:42:32.556 A:middle
this journey together.

00:42:33.106 --> 00:42:33.886 A:middle
Thank you so much.

00:42:34.176 --> 00:42:37.076 A:middle
I'd like now to bring back Mr.

00:42:37.076 --> 00:42:38.756 A:middle
Pedraum Pardehpoosh to bring us

00:42:38.756 --> 00:42:38.986 A:middle
home.

00:42:42.816 --> 00:42:43.346 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Smokey.

00:42:44.766 --> 00:42:47.336 A:middle
So you heard some insights into

00:42:47.336 --> 00:42:49.126 A:middle
the why we did this redesign

00:42:49.326 --> 00:42:51.186 A:middle
from the lead designer herself.

00:42:51.186 --> 00:42:52.226 A:middle
This is a pretty special thing.

00:42:52.226 --> 00:42:53.386 A:middle
And you heard the insights from

00:42:53.386 --> 00:42:55.426 A:middle
Smokey about our doubling down

00:42:55.426 --> 00:42:56.246 A:middle
on editorial.

00:42:56.846 --> 00:42:59.536 A:middle
And got contact information for

00:42:59.536 --> 00:43:00.666 A:middle
how to get in touch with the

00:43:00.666 --> 00:43:01.396 A:middle
Editorial Team.

00:43:01.396 --> 00:43:02.726 A:middle
This is the dawn of a new day, I

00:43:02.726 --> 00:43:03.656 A:middle
think it's safe to say.

00:43:04.146 --> 00:43:05.216 A:middle
But let's not lose sight of the

00:43:05.266 --> 00:43:07.116 A:middle
fact that ultimately all of

00:43:07.116 --> 00:43:08.496 A:middle
these efforts are meant to

00:43:08.496 --> 00:43:09.826 A:middle
improve the discoverability of

00:43:09.826 --> 00:43:11.456 A:middle
apps and games on the App Store.

00:43:12.786 --> 00:43:13.956 A:middle
By giving people a reason to

00:43:13.956 --> 00:43:15.056 A:middle
come back to the App Store every

00:43:15.056 --> 00:43:17.236 A:middle
day and giving the context of

00:43:17.236 --> 00:43:17.826 A:middle
why we're making the

00:43:17.826 --> 00:43:18.916 A:middle
recommendations that we are.

00:43:19.466 --> 00:43:20.906 A:middle
This redesign is more than just

00:43:20.906 --> 00:43:21.856 A:middle
a facelift.

00:43:22.706 --> 00:43:24.056 A:middle
It's created new opportunities

00:43:24.056 --> 00:43:25.316 A:middle
to get discovered that haven't

00:43:25.316 --> 00:43:26.166 A:middle
existed before.

00:43:26.166 --> 00:43:27.276 A:middle
Whether it's being included in

00:43:27.276 --> 00:43:28.506 A:middle
one of the stories that Smokey

00:43:28.506 --> 00:43:30.596 A:middle
outlined or appearing in the new

00:43:30.596 --> 00:43:32.276 A:middle
Apps and Games tabs, which give

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:33.716 A:middle
focus to each of those areas.

00:43:34.806 --> 00:43:35.706 A:middle
But as always, you shouldn't

00:43:35.706 --> 00:43:37.036 A:middle
just rely on being featured by

00:43:37.036 --> 00:43:39.776 A:middle
the App Store to improve your

00:43:39.776 --> 00:43:40.266 A:middle
app discovery.

00:43:40.266 --> 00:43:41.796 A:middle
There's things you can do even

00:43:41.796 --> 00:43:43.826 A:middle
starting now to get ready for

00:43:43.826 --> 00:43:44.306 A:middle
the new App Store.

00:43:44.306 --> 00:43:44.996 A:middle
And we're going to talk just a

00:43:44.996 --> 00:43:45.976 A:middle
couple minutes about them.

00:43:46.856 --> 00:43:47.756 A:middle
The first thing is in-app

00:43:47.756 --> 00:43:48.396 A:middle
purchases.

00:43:49.006 --> 00:43:50.366 A:middle
By way of quick review, in-app

00:43:50.366 --> 00:43:51.666 A:middle
purchases now have a presence on

00:43:51.666 --> 00:43:52.246 A:middle
the App Store.

00:43:52.246 --> 00:43:53.576 A:middle
They can appear on the product

00:43:53.576 --> 00:43:54.436 A:middle
details page.

00:43:55.626 --> 00:43:57.036 A:middle
In featured content areas.

00:43:57.036 --> 00:43:58.166 A:middle
In search results.

00:43:59.366 --> 00:44:00.606 A:middle
And on your product page, excuse

00:44:01.416 --> 00:44:01.506 A:middle
me.

00:44:02.936 --> 00:44:05.176 A:middle
This new ability combined with

00:44:05.176 --> 00:44:06.846 A:middle
the new Subscriptions features

00:44:07.256 --> 00:44:08.256 A:middle
that we announced last year,

00:44:08.256 --> 00:44:09.606 A:middle
giving you brand new

00:44:09.606 --> 00:44:10.626 A:middle
opportunities for creating

00:44:10.626 --> 00:44:11.576 A:middle
sustainable businesses.

00:44:12.866 --> 00:44:14.076 A:middle
So you'll want to start thinking

00:44:14.286 --> 00:44:16.056 A:middle
now about the title of these

00:44:16.056 --> 00:44:17.006 A:middle
in-app purchases and the

00:44:17.006 --> 00:44:18.746 A:middle
description and the image that

00:44:18.746 --> 00:44:21.996 A:middle
you're going to use for them,

00:44:22.266 --> 00:44:23.346 A:middle
particularly now that they have

00:44:23.346 --> 00:44:24.506 A:middle
such increased visibility.

00:44:25.626 --> 00:44:26.886 A:middle
There's a couple of StoreKit

00:44:26.886 --> 00:44:29.036 A:middle
sessions and an iTunes Connect

00:44:29.036 --> 00:44:29.866 A:middle
session where you can get more

00:44:29.866 --> 00:44:30.806 A:middle
information about this.

00:44:31.976 --> 00:44:33.056 A:middle
We'll review those at the end.

00:44:33.906 --> 00:44:35.436 A:middle
Titles are now 30 characters in

00:44:35.436 --> 00:44:36.516 A:middle
the App Store, in the all new

00:44:36.516 --> 00:44:37.006 A:middle
App Store.

00:44:37.856 --> 00:44:38.876 A:middle
But in addition, you will have a

00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:39.506 A:middle
subtitle.

00:44:40.676 --> 00:44:42.286 A:middle
Monika showed this in context as

00:44:42.286 --> 00:44:42.786 A:middle
well.

00:44:43.176 --> 00:44:44.276 A:middle
You'll want to think carefully

00:44:44.276 --> 00:44:45.956 A:middle
about how to use this subtitle

00:44:46.576 --> 00:44:47.886 A:middle
to convey what your app does.

00:44:47.886 --> 00:44:48.856 A:middle
To give a little bit more

00:44:48.856 --> 00:44:49.716 A:middle
information about it.

00:44:49.716 --> 00:44:51.126 A:middle
To say something compelling.

00:44:51.126 --> 00:44:52.936 A:middle
But don't be misleading.

00:44:55.536 --> 00:44:57.236 A:middle
Consider using your subtitle to

00:44:57.236 --> 00:44:58.876 A:middle
highlight a feature or a typical

00:44:58.876 --> 00:45:00.966 A:middle
use of your app that'll resonate

00:45:00.966 --> 00:45:01.656 A:middle
with your audience.

00:45:02.686 --> 00:45:03.946 A:middle
And this subtitle will follow

00:45:03.946 --> 00:45:05.276 A:middle
your app title around throughout

00:45:05.276 --> 00:45:07.776 A:middle
the app store, whether it's in

00:45:07.776 --> 00:45:10.046 A:middle
the Apps or the Games tab, on a

00:45:10.046 --> 00:45:11.226 A:middle
product page or in search

00:45:11.226 --> 00:45:11.736 A:middle
results.

00:45:12.286 --> 00:45:15.596 A:middle
Let's talk about video app

00:45:15.596 --> 00:45:16.116 A:middle
previews.

00:45:16.396 --> 00:45:17.526 A:middle
We know that when customers

00:45:17.526 --> 00:45:18.686 A:middle
engage with these video app

00:45:18.726 --> 00:45:21.586 A:middle
previews, customers tend to

00:45:21.986 --> 00:45:24.176 A:middle
download that app or game more.

00:45:25.256 --> 00:45:26.316 A:middle
And so we thought about, "Well,

00:45:26.316 --> 00:45:27.876 A:middle
how can we make it more obvious

00:45:27.876 --> 00:45:28.646 A:middle
that these are videos?"

00:45:29.796 --> 00:45:30.886 A:middle
Well, auto-playing is one way

00:45:30.886 --> 00:45:31.416 A:middle
you can do that.

00:45:32.596 --> 00:45:34.296 A:middle
And so we really encourage you,

00:45:34.296 --> 00:45:35.206 A:middle
particularly now that you can

00:45:35.206 --> 00:45:35.946 A:middle
have three of them.

00:45:37.246 --> 00:45:38.476 A:middle
And they can be localized.

00:45:39.636 --> 00:45:40.516 A:middle
You should really be thinking

00:45:40.516 --> 00:45:42.926 A:middle
about how to create a video that

00:45:43.236 --> 00:45:44.636 A:middle
encourages customers to download

00:45:45.276 --> 00:45:48.956 A:middle
your app or game.

00:45:50.596 --> 00:45:51.906 A:middle
We think video is a big deal on

00:45:51.906 --> 00:45:52.456 A:middle
the App Store.

00:45:55.036 --> 00:45:55.826 A:middle
You can learn more about what

00:45:55.826 --> 00:45:56.946 A:middle
makes a compelling video by

00:45:56.946 --> 00:45:58.466 A:middle
visiting the site, and by

00:45:58.466 --> 00:45:59.626 A:middle
visiting the App Store labs.

00:46:03.266 --> 00:46:04.246 A:middle
Now, in addition to your app

00:46:04.246 --> 00:46:06.696 A:middle
description, you can have 170

00:46:06.696 --> 00:46:08.166 A:middle
characters of text, which can be

00:46:08.166 --> 00:46:08.926 A:middle
updated any time.

00:46:08.926 --> 00:46:10.126 A:middle
We call this Promo Text.

00:46:10.746 --> 00:46:11.836 A:middle
This will get concatenated on

00:46:11.836 --> 00:46:13.186 A:middle
top of your app description.

00:46:14.286 --> 00:46:15.376 A:middle
And it won't require an app

00:46:15.376 --> 00:46:15.866 A:middle
update.

00:46:17.576 --> 00:46:18.706 A:middle
This is a great way to talk

00:46:18.706 --> 00:46:19.646 A:middle
about one of the new features

00:46:19.646 --> 00:46:20.896 A:middle
that's a temporary feature or a

00:46:20.896 --> 00:46:21.896 A:middle
price promotion that you're

00:46:21.896 --> 00:46:23.566 A:middle
having or some new accolade that

00:46:23.566 --> 00:46:24.516 A:middle
your app has received.

00:46:25.356 --> 00:46:26.216 A:middle
This is something else that you

00:46:26.216 --> 00:46:27.216 A:middle
can start thinking about right

00:46:27.216 --> 00:46:27.496 A:middle
now.

00:46:28.416 --> 00:46:31.596 A:middle
Let's talk about ratings and

00:46:31.596 --> 00:46:31.856 A:middle
reviews.

00:46:31.856 --> 00:46:32.746 A:middle
This got some applause.

00:46:32.826 --> 00:46:35.416 A:middle
This warms my heart.

00:46:35.656 --> 00:46:36.856 A:middle
We did a couple things in iOS

00:46:36.856 --> 00:46:40.316 A:middle
10.3 releasing a Reviews API.

00:46:42.116 --> 00:46:43.726 A:middle
And allowing developers to

00:46:43.726 --> 00:46:44.746 A:middle
respond to reviews.

00:46:44.746 --> 00:46:45.906 A:middle
And the response has been

00:46:45.906 --> 00:46:46.406 A:middle
tremendous.

00:46:47.256 --> 00:46:49.696 A:middle
We've seen almost 400,000 --

00:46:49.916 --> 00:46:51.166 A:middle
this number's actually a little

00:46:51.166 --> 00:46:51.566 A:middle
old.

00:46:52.086 --> 00:46:53.496 A:middle
We've seen almost 400,000

00:46:53.886 --> 00:46:56.046 A:middle
responses to reviews since the

00:46:56.046 --> 00:46:56.506 A:middle
launch of this.

00:46:56.506 --> 00:46:57.706 A:middle
And we know that when customers

00:46:57.706 --> 00:47:00.106 A:middle
go back and change their rating

00:47:00.106 --> 00:47:01.626 A:middle
based on a response that they

00:47:01.626 --> 00:47:02.846 A:middle
have received from a developer,

00:47:03.326 --> 00:47:06.146 A:middle
overwhelmingly that change in

00:47:06.146 --> 00:47:07.426 A:middle
direction is in a positive way.

00:47:08.416 --> 00:47:12.226 A:middle
So this is really important.

00:47:13.296 --> 00:47:14.736 A:middle
In the new App Store, as Monika

00:47:14.736 --> 00:47:16.026 A:middle
mentioned, we no longer reset

00:47:16.026 --> 00:47:17.216 A:middle
app rating when you submit a new

00:47:17.216 --> 00:47:17.726 A:middle
version.

00:47:18.826 --> 00:47:19.956 A:middle
Which is awesome for many

00:47:19.956 --> 00:47:20.456 A:middle
developers.

00:47:20.456 --> 00:47:22.676 A:middle
Some developers wouldn't mind

00:47:23.306 --> 00:47:24.166 A:middle
resetting that rating.

00:47:25.196 --> 00:47:26.716 A:middle
And now, with the new App Store,

00:47:27.276 --> 00:47:28.236 A:middle
with each submission you're

00:47:28.236 --> 00:47:29.326 A:middle
going to have the ability to do

00:47:29.326 --> 00:47:30.616 A:middle
so, to reset your rating.

00:47:31.456 --> 00:47:32.406 A:middle
But you should be careful about

00:47:32.406 --> 00:47:32.576 A:middle
that.

00:47:32.576 --> 00:47:34.276 A:middle
It sounds like an interesting

00:47:34.276 --> 00:47:34.716 A:middle
option.

00:47:34.716 --> 00:47:36.346 A:middle
But we know that customers value

00:47:36.806 --> 00:47:39.726 A:middle
that rating or seeing that an

00:47:39.726 --> 00:47:41.466 A:middle
app has ratings, a lot, when

00:47:41.466 --> 00:47:42.166 A:middle
they're making a download

00:47:42.166 --> 00:47:42.526 A:middle
decision.

00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:44.396 A:middle
So you will want to be careful

00:47:44.956 --> 00:47:47.666 A:middle
about that.

00:47:47.886 --> 00:47:49.456 A:middle
You can get advice about best

00:47:49.456 --> 00:47:50.906 A:middle
practices associated with

00:47:51.336 --> 00:47:52.706 A:middle
responding to customer reviews

00:47:52.706 --> 00:47:54.796 A:middle
by visiting this URL.

00:47:56.356 --> 00:47:58.576 A:middle
And like we mentioned, we

00:47:58.576 --> 00:47:59.936 A:middle
strongly recommend you make

00:47:59.936 --> 00:48:01.826 A:middle
responding to customer reviews a

00:48:01.826 --> 00:48:02.846 A:middle
regular part of your customer

00:48:02.846 --> 00:48:03.666 A:middle
service hygiene.

00:48:04.426 --> 00:48:06.396 A:middle
And in fact, in July, in iTunes

00:48:06.396 --> 00:48:08.356 A:middle
Connect, we'll be enabling a new

00:48:08.356 --> 00:48:10.906 A:middle
role in iTunes Connect for

00:48:10.906 --> 00:48:12.816 A:middle
customer service so that you can

00:48:12.816 --> 00:48:14.016 A:middle
have somebody that's focused

00:48:14.016 --> 00:48:14.936 A:middle
just on that and doesn't have

00:48:14.936 --> 00:48:17.786 A:middle
access to other elements inside

00:48:18.606 --> 00:48:18.696 A:middle
there.

00:48:19.576 --> 00:48:21.666 A:middle
We're constantly improving the

00:48:21.666 --> 00:48:22.776 A:middle
way Core Search works in the

00:48:22.776 --> 00:48:23.286 A:middle
Apps Store.

00:48:23.606 --> 00:48:24.766 A:middle
But the most visible thing we've

00:48:24.766 --> 00:48:27.256 A:middle
done this year is by adding the

00:48:27.256 --> 00:48:28.446 A:middle
stories that our editors are

00:48:28.446 --> 00:48:28.776 A:middle
writing.

00:48:30.416 --> 00:48:31.956 A:middle
Additionally, in-app purchases,

00:48:31.956 --> 00:48:34.006 A:middle
categories and developers will

00:48:34.006 --> 00:48:35.186 A:middle
be able to appear in these

00:48:35.186 --> 00:48:38.236 A:middle
search results as well.

00:48:38.436 --> 00:48:40.986 A:middle
Speaking of search, last year we

00:48:40.986 --> 00:48:42.226 A:middle
announced Search Ads.

00:48:43.046 --> 00:48:44.266 A:middle
And it launched in the US.

00:48:45.736 --> 00:48:46.716 A:middle
And it launched in the UK,

00:48:46.716 --> 00:48:47.736 A:middle
Australia and New Zealand in

00:48:47.736 --> 00:48:48.046 A:middle
April.

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:50.606 A:middle
The results have been really

00:48:50.606 --> 00:48:51.796 A:middle
strong for advertisers.

00:48:52.316 --> 00:48:53.586 A:middle
High tap through rates.

00:48:54.256 --> 00:48:55.926 A:middle
Conversion rates above 50%.

00:48:56.456 --> 00:48:57.806 A:middle
And cost per acquisition just

00:48:57.806 --> 00:48:58.406 A:middle
over a dollar.

00:48:58.406 --> 00:48:59.866 A:middle
These are really impressive

00:48:59.866 --> 00:49:01.266 A:middle
numbers for those that know

00:49:01.266 --> 00:49:02.366 A:middle
stuff about advertising.

00:49:02.606 --> 00:49:04.436 A:middle
An apps flyer industry study

00:49:04.436 --> 00:49:05.816 A:middle
published earlier this year

00:49:06.066 --> 00:49:07.556 A:middle
described the quality of users

00:49:07.556 --> 00:49:08.886 A:middle
Search Ads delivers were the

00:49:08.886 --> 00:49:10.676 A:middle
best 30-day retention rate for

00:49:10.676 --> 00:49:12.926 A:middle
iOS apps and a top three ranking

00:49:12.926 --> 00:49:13.526 A:middle
for games.

00:49:15.436 --> 00:49:16.596 A:middle
We're working hard to deliver

00:49:16.596 --> 00:49:17.836 A:middle
opportunities to drive downloads

00:49:17.836 --> 00:49:18.816 A:middle
and engagement with your apps.

00:49:18.886 --> 00:49:20.316 A:middle
And bringing Search Ads to more

00:49:20.316 --> 00:49:22.146 A:middle
of the markets that you've told

00:49:22.146 --> 00:49:22.966 A:middle
us are important to your

00:49:22.966 --> 00:49:23.296 A:middle
business.

00:49:23.956 --> 00:49:25.416 A:middle
Many developers large and small

00:49:25.416 --> 00:49:26.476 A:middle
have already taken advantage of

00:49:26.476 --> 00:49:26.596 A:middle
it.

00:49:26.596 --> 00:49:27.596 A:middle
And this is another thing you'll

00:49:27.596 --> 00:49:28.976 A:middle
want to consult with us about to

00:49:29.026 --> 00:49:32.876 A:middle
find out if it's right for you.

00:49:32.876 --> 00:49:34.556 A:middle
In summary, there's plenty for

00:49:34.556 --> 00:49:35.766 A:middle
you to be thinking about even

00:49:35.766 --> 00:49:37.436 A:middle
now in advance of iOS 11

00:49:37.436 --> 00:49:39.966 A:middle
shipping as it relates to your

00:49:39.966 --> 00:49:40.976 A:middle
app's presence in the Apps.

00:49:40.976 --> 00:49:42.016 A:middle
And we hope you take advantage

00:49:42.016 --> 00:49:43.016 A:middle
of the folks that are here from

00:49:43.016 --> 00:49:44.626 A:middle
the App Store this week to learn

00:49:44.626 --> 00:49:46.946 A:middle
more about this.

00:49:47.646 --> 00:49:48.826 A:middle
For more information on this

00:49:48.826 --> 00:49:49.996 A:middle
session you can visit this site.

00:49:52.566 --> 00:49:53.846 A:middle
There are related sessions

00:49:54.636 --> 00:49:56.986 A:middle
listed as well as labs.

00:49:58.116 --> 00:49:58.836 A:middle
Come speak with us.

00:49:58.836 --> 00:50:00.146 A:middle
Last thing I want to say is that

00:50:00.146 --> 00:50:01.266 A:middle
it was my honor to be able to

00:50:01.266 --> 00:50:02.446 A:middle
introduce this new App Store

00:50:02.446 --> 00:50:03.696 A:middle
that's been a few years in the

00:50:03.696 --> 00:50:04.026 A:middle
running.

00:50:05.116 --> 00:50:06.906 A:middle
But it was done with a lot of

00:50:06.906 --> 00:50:07.926 A:middle
cross-functional work.

00:50:08.256 --> 00:50:09.266 A:middle
I know some of those folks in

00:50:09.266 --> 00:50:10.416 A:middle
the audience today.

00:50:10.716 --> 00:50:11.866 A:middle
Those that work in the App Store

00:50:11.866 --> 00:50:12.906 A:middle
please stand up for a second to

00:50:12.906 --> 00:50:13.656 A:middle
get recognized.

00:50:15.166 --> 00:50:16.066 A:middle
Give it up for these folks who

00:50:16.066 --> 00:50:16.816 A:middle
have been working their butts

00:50:16.816 --> 00:50:17.476 A:middle
off.

00:50:18.016 --> 00:50:23.736 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:50:24.236 --> 00:50:27.556 A:middle
Thank you, everybody.
