[ Background Sounds ]

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:17.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:18.906 A:middle
Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:23.036 A:middle
[ Clapping ]

00:00:23.536 --> 00:00:24.596 A:middle
My name's Pete Hare and I'm an

00:00:24.596 --> 00:00:26.056 A:middle
engineer on the App Store team

00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:26.546 A:middle
here at Apple.

00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:28.536 A:middle
Now you're probably here because

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:29.816 A:middle
you're in one of a couple of

00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:30.446 A:middle
different groups.

00:00:30.446 --> 00:00:31.466 A:middle
Maybe you're here to find out a

00:00:31.506 --> 00:00:33.106 A:middle
bit more about integrating

00:00:33.106 --> 00:00:34.606 A:middle
in-app purchases into your

00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:35.566 A:middle
application and you want to know

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:36.686 A:middle
a bit more about how to do it

00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:38.296 A:middle
securely and reliably.

00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:39.836 A:middle
Or maybe you're here to find out

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.706 A:middle
about subscriptions and you want

00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:43.136 A:middle
to understand the process of

00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:44.786 A:middle
maintaining a subscription state

00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:46.596 A:middle
across multiple platforms in a

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:47.896 A:middle
server environment, that kind of

00:00:47.896 --> 00:00:48.126 A:middle
thing.

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:50.356 A:middle
Well whichever group you land

00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:51.556 A:middle
in, in-app purchases really

00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:53.426 A:middle
represents a new level of trust

00:00:53.426 --> 00:00:54.896 A:middle
between you and your users.

00:00:55.206 --> 00:00:56.576 A:middle
You see as soon a user is

00:00:56.576 --> 00:00:58.516 A:middle
handing over money in exchange

00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:00.086 A:middle
for digital content or services,

00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:01.616 A:middle
they're really entrusting you

00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:03.136 A:middle
with the responsibility of

00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:04.736 A:middle
delivering that in a reliable

00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:05.536 A:middle
and secure manner.

00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:07.476 A:middle
So today we're going to talk

00:01:07.476 --> 00:01:09.366 A:middle
about some techniques do that.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:10.596 A:middle
Firstly, we're going to discuss

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:11.996 A:middle
receipt validation in greater

00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:12.476 A:middle
detail.

00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:13.936 A:middle
We talked on it a little bit

00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:14.936 A:middle
this morning in the what's new

00:01:14.936 --> 00:01:16.106 A:middle
session but we're going to go

00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:17.276 A:middle
into some details around how to

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:19.026 A:middle
do this on the user's device.

00:01:19.376 --> 00:01:20.936 A:middle
We're also going to talk about

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:22.426 A:middle
maintaining a subscription state

00:01:22.726 --> 00:01:24.476 A:middle
particularly on the server and

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:26.336 A:middle
how to update multiple different

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:27.496 A:middle
platforms based on that

00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:28.296 A:middle
subscription state.

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:30.406 A:middle
Finally, we're also going to

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:31.236 A:middle
touch on development in a

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:32.156 A:middle
sandbox environment.

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:33.196 A:middle
So how you can use these

00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:34.316 A:middle
technologies when you're

00:01:34.316 --> 00:01:35.736 A:middle
developing without actually

00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:36.886 A:middle
having to use your own money.

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:39.266 A:middle
So I'm going to put up this

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:39.666 A:middle
diagram.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:40.376 A:middle
This is what we looked at in

00:01:40.376 --> 00:01:41.166 A:middle
this morning's session.

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:42.566 A:middle
This was the in-app purchase

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:42.966 A:middle
flow.

00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.026 A:middle
So this is what you need to

00:01:44.026 --> 00:01:45.336 A:middle
implement in your application in

00:01:45.336 --> 00:01:47.136 A:middle
order to actually sell in-app

00:01:47.186 --> 00:01:47.746 A:middle
purchases.

00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:49.496 A:middle
In this particular session,

00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:50.346 A:middle
we're just going to really focus

00:01:50.346 --> 00:01:51.646 A:middle
on these last three points

00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:52.786 A:middle
though which I'm going to refer

00:01:52.786 --> 00:01:54.386 A:middle
to as processing transactions.

00:01:54.516 --> 00:01:55.686 A:middle
So this is when StoreKit

00:01:55.686 --> 00:01:56.866 A:middle
delivers a transaction to you

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.536 A:middle
once a user's made a payment and

00:01:58.536 --> 00:01:59.936 A:middle
it's up to you to then process

00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:01.746 A:middle
that transaction and deliver the

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:02.956 A:middle
content to the user who's paid

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:03.816 A:middle
for it.

00:02:03.816 --> 00:02:05.086 A:middle
So I'm going to expand out these

00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:06.376 A:middle
three steps now and also

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:07.746 A:middle
introduce an extra layer to this

00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:08.936 A:middle
which is to add your server into

00:02:08.936 --> 00:02:09.376 A:middle
the mix.

00:02:10.636 --> 00:02:11.676 A:middle
So this is how we can think of

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:12.776 A:middle
it for this particular talk.

00:02:12.986 --> 00:02:14.026 A:middle
The process is going to start

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:15.796 A:middle
with us receiving a transaction.

00:02:16.346 --> 00:02:17.676 A:middle
And this arrives by a StoreKit

00:02:17.676 --> 00:02:18.586 A:middle
on the user's device.

00:02:19.436 --> 00:02:20.376 A:middle
Then you make a choice as to

00:02:20.376 --> 00:02:21.626 A:middle
whether you want to validate the

00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:23.766 A:middle
receipt on the user's device or

00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:24.456 A:middle
up in the server.

00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:28.106 A:middle
From there, you can proceed to

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:29.396 A:middle
inspect the contents of that

00:02:29.396 --> 00:02:31.566 A:middle
receipt and unlock content or

00:02:31.566 --> 00:02:32.736 A:middle
update a subscription state

00:02:32.796 --> 00:02:34.416 A:middle
based on that contents.

00:02:34.936 --> 00:02:36.116 A:middle
And finally the last step in the

00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:36.906 A:middle
process, to finish the

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.856 A:middle
transaction back down on the

00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:39.706 A:middle
user's device.

00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:42.006 A:middle
Now you'll notice that the first

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:44.116 A:middle
and last parts of this flow

00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:46.096 A:middle
occur on the device level only.

00:02:46.096 --> 00:02:47.766 A:middle
We don't allow transactions to

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:48.726 A:middle
come in at the server level.

00:02:48.726 --> 00:02:49.736 A:middle
Now this is really important.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:51.436 A:middle
Even if you're using a service

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:52.336 A:middle
side flow for receipt

00:02:52.336 --> 00:02:53.346 A:middle
validation, you still need to

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:54.386 A:middle
make sure that you receive and

00:02:54.386 --> 00:02:55.816 A:middle
finish transactions on the

00:02:55.816 --> 00:02:56.516 A:middle
user's device.

00:02:57.946 --> 00:02:59.856 A:middle
Now this morning, we also

00:02:59.856 --> 00:03:01.196 A:middle
discussed the four different

00:03:01.196 --> 00:03:02.266 A:middle
types of in-app purchases.

00:03:02.746 --> 00:03:03.646 A:middle
If you're dealing with

00:03:03.646 --> 00:03:04.696 A:middle
consumable products or

00:03:04.696 --> 00:03:06.136 A:middle
non-consumable products, it's

00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:07.356 A:middle
quite likely that you'll do a

00:03:07.356 --> 00:03:08.576 A:middle
flow like this, which is the on

00:03:08.576 --> 00:03:09.176 A:middle
device flow.

00:03:09.776 --> 00:03:11.036 A:middle
This is where you can inspect

00:03:11.246 --> 00:03:12.496 A:middle
the receipt and unlock content

00:03:12.496 --> 00:03:13.696 A:middle
without sending anything up to

00:03:13.696 --> 00:03:14.956 A:middle
your server or requiring a

00:03:14.956 --> 00:03:15.736 A:middle
network request.

00:03:16.306 --> 00:03:17.226 A:middle
If you're dealing with

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:18.626 A:middle
subscriptions, auto renewable

00:03:18.626 --> 00:03:19.656 A:middle
subscriptions in particular,

00:03:19.946 --> 00:03:20.836 A:middle
it's quite likely that you'll

00:03:20.836 --> 00:03:22.556 A:middle
have a situation like this where

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:23.926 A:middle
you want to keep state on the

00:03:23.926 --> 00:03:24.576 A:middle
server side.

00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:25.726 A:middle
And you need to have a server

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:26.986 A:middle
being able to update multiple

00:03:26.986 --> 00:03:27.826 A:middle
devices from there.

00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:30.036 A:middle
You can, of course, do both of

00:03:30.036 --> 00:03:31.056 A:middle
these techniques if you want.

00:03:31.416 --> 00:03:32.916 A:middle
But either way, the process

00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:34.206 A:middle
still starts at that same point

00:03:34.206 --> 00:03:35.636 A:middle
which is to receive transaction

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:36.766 A:middle
on the device.

00:03:36.886 --> 00:03:38.526 A:middle
So let's dive now into each of

00:03:38.526 --> 00:03:39.476 A:middle
these steps to see what they

00:03:39.476 --> 00:03:39.946 A:middle
look like.

00:03:43.236 --> 00:03:44.276 A:middle
This is right at the start of my

00:03:44.276 --> 00:03:45.436 A:middle
application life cycle.

00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:47.256 A:middle
We have the did finish launching

00:03:47.256 --> 00:03:48.646 A:middle
with options delegate method on

00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:50.406 A:middle
the application and here we have

00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:51.496 A:middle
to register a transaction

00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:53.096 A:middle
observer for the SK payment

00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:53.306 A:middle
queue.

00:03:53.646 --> 00:03:54.506 A:middle
So you need the transaction

00:03:54.506 --> 00:03:55.526 A:middle
observer to be registered as

00:03:55.566 --> 00:03:56.566 A:middle
early as possible in the

00:03:56.566 --> 00:03:57.816 A:middle
application life cycle so that

00:03:58.086 --> 00:03:59.156 A:middle
you can start to receive the

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:00.576 A:middle
updated transactions that come

00:04:00.576 --> 00:04:01.186 A:middle
through StoreKit.

00:04:02.086 --> 00:04:02.966 A:middle
Here I'm just adding the app

00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:04.656 A:middle
delegate itself as my payment

00:04:04.656 --> 00:04:06.156 A:middle
observer but you might add a

00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:07.356 A:middle
separate controller object to do

00:04:07.356 --> 00:04:07.796 A:middle
this for you.

00:04:07.796 --> 00:04:08.526 A:middle
It's really up to you.

00:04:09.226 --> 00:04:10.266 A:middle
What's important is that it's

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:11.246 A:middle
happening right at the start of

00:04:11.246 --> 00:04:13.036 A:middle
the application life cycle but

00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:14.336 A:middle
once that's registered, you're

00:04:14.336 --> 00:04:15.966 A:middle
ready to start receiving

00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:17.646 A:middle
transactions through the updated

00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:18.586 A:middle
transactions call back.

00:04:19.616 --> 00:04:20.736 A:middle
So this is the updated

00:04:20.736 --> 00:04:22.096 A:middle
transactions call back in the

00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:22.926 A:middle
transaction observer.

00:04:23.776 --> 00:04:25.116 A:middle
And you receive an array of

00:04:25.116 --> 00:04:25.976 A:middle
transactions that you can

00:04:25.976 --> 00:04:26.786 A:middle
iterate through.

00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:28.016 A:middle
You can check the transaction

00:04:28.016 --> 00:04:28.946 A:middle
state on each of these.

00:04:29.396 --> 00:04:30.156 A:middle
And you want to look for a

00:04:30.156 --> 00:04:31.436 A:middle
transaction in the purchase

00:04:31.436 --> 00:04:31.726 A:middle
state.

00:04:31.726 --> 00:04:33.096 A:middle
So this is a transaction that

00:04:33.096 --> 00:04:34.696 A:middle
StoreKit deems appropriate for

00:04:34.696 --> 00:04:36.216 A:middle
you to go ahead and validate.

00:04:36.216 --> 00:04:37.726 A:middle
And then unlock content for.

00:04:37.936 --> 00:04:39.166 A:middle
So it's telling you that the

00:04:39.166 --> 00:04:40.256 A:middle
user has actually handed over

00:04:40.886 --> 00:04:41.000 A:middle
money.

00:04:42.476 --> 00:04:43.816 A:middle
So once you've got that

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.016 A:middle
transaction in a purchase state,

00:04:45.016 --> 00:04:46.196 A:middle
you're ready to go ahead with

00:04:46.196 --> 00:04:47.346 A:middle
the next step in this diagram.

00:04:47.936 --> 00:04:49.426 A:middle
So let's firstly look at how to

00:04:49.426 --> 00:04:50.806 A:middle
do this validation of the

00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:52.606 A:middle
receipt on the user's device.

00:04:53.346 --> 00:04:54.616 A:middle
Now what is the receipt?

00:04:55.006 --> 00:04:55.926 A:middle
We talked about it a little bit

00:04:55.926 --> 00:04:56.746 A:middle
this morning but for those of

00:04:56.746 --> 00:04:57.906 A:middle
you who weren't there, the

00:04:57.906 --> 00:04:59.136 A:middle
receipt's really just like a

00:04:59.136 --> 00:04:59.606 A:middle
document.

00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:00.936 A:middle
Like a receipt you'd get at any

00:05:00.936 --> 00:05:01.596 A:middle
department store.

00:05:01.596 --> 00:05:03.136 A:middle
It's a proof of purchase that

00:05:03.466 --> 00:05:04.736 A:middle
really is an authentic document

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:05.566 A:middle
that indicates they've bought

00:05:05.566 --> 00:05:06.676 A:middle
what they say they've bought.

00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:08.486 A:middle
So we've have this application

00:05:08.486 --> 00:05:09.646 A:middle
receipt which is a trusted

00:05:09.646 --> 00:05:11.306 A:middle
record of the app and any in-app

00:05:11.306 --> 00:05:13.116 A:middle
purchases that a user's made in

00:05:13.116 --> 00:05:13.736 A:middle
your application.

00:05:14.806 --> 00:05:16.316 A:middle
This particular receipt's stored

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:16.976 A:middle
on the device.

00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:18.586 A:middle
And it's issued by the App

00:05:18.586 --> 00:05:18.786 A:middle
Store.

00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:19.766 A:middle
It's put there by StoreKit.

00:05:21.116 --> 00:05:22.606 A:middle
Now it's assigned an verifiable

00:05:22.606 --> 00:05:24.166 A:middle
document which means you can use

00:05:24.456 --> 00:05:25.726 A:middle
certificates to be able to check

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:26.896 A:middle
that this document was actually

00:05:26.956 --> 00:05:28.696 A:middle
issued by Apple and put there on

00:05:28.696 --> 00:05:30.276 A:middle
the user's device to make sure

00:05:31.076 --> 00:05:32.036 A:middle
it's authentic.

00:05:32.136 --> 00:05:33.236 A:middle
Finally it's for your app on

00:05:33.236 --> 00:05:35.306 A:middle
that device only which means it

00:05:35.306 --> 00:05:36.536 A:middle
can't be shared across devices

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:38.266 A:middle
or amongst other applications.

00:05:39.746 --> 00:05:41.006 A:middle
So when it comes receipt

00:05:41.006 --> 00:05:42.326 A:middle
validation, this is the process

00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:43.756 A:middle
of ensuring that this document

00:05:43.756 --> 00:05:45.236 A:middle
is an authentic document and not

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:46.686 A:middle
some phony one that's someone

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:47.076 A:middle
put there.

00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:48.166 A:middle
There's two ways to do this.

00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:49.296 A:middle
You can do this on the device,

00:05:49.426 --> 00:05:50.446 A:middle
which we're about to look at now

00:05:51.346 --> 00:05:52.276 A:middle
and of course, you can do this

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:53.866 A:middle
by sending it up to your server

00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:54.916 A:middle
using the server-to-server

00:05:54.916 --> 00:05:55.526 A:middle
validation.

00:05:55.526 --> 00:05:57.666 A:middle
Now I just want to point out

00:05:57.666 --> 00:05:58.306 A:middle
here that if you're on the

00:05:58.306 --> 00:05:59.486 A:middle
user's device, it's really

00:05:59.486 --> 00:06:00.336 A:middle
important that you don't use

00:06:00.386 --> 00:06:01.896 A:middle
online validation directly from

00:06:01.896 --> 00:06:03.346 A:middle
the user's device because this

00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:05.036 A:middle
isn't a secure way of checking

00:06:05.256 --> 00:06:05.526 A:middle
at all.

00:06:05.526 --> 00:06:06.466 A:middle
If you're going to be doing it

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:07.476 A:middle
directly on the device, you need

00:06:07.476 --> 00:06:08.606 A:middle
to use these checks we're about

00:06:08.606 --> 00:06:09.396 A:middle
to do now.

00:06:10.046 --> 00:06:12.406 A:middle
So what does the receipt look

00:06:12.406 --> 00:06:12.606 A:middle
like?

00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:13.496 A:middle
Let's take a look at the actual

00:06:13.496 --> 00:06:13.916 A:middle
document.

00:06:14.496 --> 00:06:16.756 A:middle
The receipt document.

00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:18.346 A:middle
We just take all that purchase

00:06:18.346 --> 00:06:19.216 A:middle
information about your

00:06:19.216 --> 00:06:20.256 A:middle
application including all the

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:21.396 A:middle
in-app purchases and we wrap

00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:23.056 A:middle
that around certificates and

00:06:23.056 --> 00:06:25.066 A:middle
signatures in order to create a

00:06:25.066 --> 00:06:26.106 A:middle
document that you can check for

00:06:26.106 --> 00:06:26.736 A:middle
authenticity.

00:06:27.296 --> 00:06:28.736 A:middle
So it's a document that's stored

00:06:28.776 --> 00:06:30.206 A:middle
in the application bundle and we

00:06:30.206 --> 00:06:31.676 A:middle
provide an API for you to

00:06:31.676 --> 00:06:33.496 A:middle
actually get that document.

00:06:34.376 --> 00:06:35.286 A:middle
It's a single file.

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:37.146 A:middle
And it contains all the purchase

00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:38.656 A:middle
data about the application and

00:06:38.656 --> 00:06:40.186 A:middle
also the in-app purchases that

00:06:40.186 --> 00:06:40.586 A:middle
have occurred.

00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:42.196 A:middle
And it also contains a signature

00:06:42.266 --> 00:06:43.986 A:middle
for you to be able to check for

00:06:44.106 --> 00:06:44.796 A:middle
authenticity.

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:45.926 A:middle
To make sure it's issued by

00:06:45.926 --> 00:06:46.206 A:middle
Apple.

00:06:47.326 --> 00:06:49.026 A:middle
The document is based on a

00:06:49.026 --> 00:06:50.356 A:middle
series of industry standards.

00:06:50.356 --> 00:06:51.526 A:middle
So it's actually signed using

00:06:51.676 --> 00:06:52.936 A:middle
the public key cryptographic

00:06:52.976 --> 00:06:54.376 A:middle
standard 7, cryptographic

00:06:54.376 --> 00:06:54.756 A:middle
container.

00:06:56.066 --> 00:06:58.256 A:middle
It's encoded using an ASN.1 data

00:06:58.256 --> 00:06:58.696 A:middle
encoding.

00:06:58.696 --> 00:07:00.456 A:middle
And don't let the acronyms, the

00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:01.666 A:middle
daunting acronyms fool you.

00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:03.126 A:middle
These are actually very public

00:07:03.126 --> 00:07:04.146 A:middle
open standards and there's a lot

00:07:04.146 --> 00:07:05.546 A:middle
of information available online

00:07:05.546 --> 00:07:06.836 A:middle
for you to be able to actually

00:07:06.836 --> 00:07:07.586 A:middle
do these things.

00:07:08.186 --> 00:07:09.756 A:middle
One prebuilt technique that you

00:07:09.756 --> 00:07:10.926 A:middle
might recognize is actual

00:07:10.926 --> 00:07:11.466 A:middle
OpenSSL.

00:07:11.756 --> 00:07:13.296 A:middle
So OpenSSL is a framework that

00:07:13.686 --> 00:07:15.006 A:middle
not only provides the

00:07:15.006 --> 00:07:16.296 A:middle
functionality for secure web

00:07:16.296 --> 00:07:17.396 A:middle
traffic tunneling, it also

00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:18.956 A:middle
includes functions to be able to

00:07:19.216 --> 00:07:20.496 A:middle
read in the data encoding from

00:07:20.496 --> 00:07:22.486 A:middle
an ASN.1 payload and also check

00:07:22.486 --> 00:07:23.606 A:middle
the signing on a cryptographic

00:07:23.606 --> 00:07:24.446 A:middle
container like this.

00:07:25.676 --> 00:07:26.876 A:middle
Of course, you can use a

00:07:26.876 --> 00:07:28.346 A:middle
prebuilt solution like OpenSSL

00:07:28.346 --> 00:07:29.546 A:middle
or you could even roll your own,

00:07:29.546 --> 00:07:30.606 A:middle
you know, to read in this

00:07:30.606 --> 00:07:31.316 A:middle
particular data.

00:07:31.626 --> 00:07:32.516 A:middle
It's really up to you and your

00:07:32.516 --> 00:07:34.096 A:middle
business as to which solution

00:07:34.096 --> 00:07:34.526 A:middle
you use.

00:07:34.526 --> 00:07:35.636 A:middle
You see when it comes to

00:07:35.636 --> 00:07:37.146 A:middle
security and this particular

00:07:37.146 --> 00:07:39.306 A:middle
type of check, it's not a binary

00:07:39.306 --> 00:07:39.626 A:middle
choice.

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:41.166 A:middle
It's not secure or not secure.

00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:42.336 A:middle
You know, security's a scale.

00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:43.586 A:middle
So you have to think about how

00:07:43.646 --> 00:07:45.006 A:middle
far down that scale you want to

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.876 A:middle
go in order to verify these

00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:47.486 A:middle
purchases.

00:07:48.706 --> 00:07:50.406 A:middle
But either way, it starts by

00:07:50.406 --> 00:07:51.576 A:middle
reading in this encrypted data

00:07:51.726 --> 00:07:52.396 A:middle
for this document.

00:07:52.396 --> 00:07:53.706 A:middle
So you do that by using the API

00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:54.346 A:middle
I mentioned.

00:07:54.706 --> 00:07:56.836 A:middle
It's the AppStoreReceiptURL API

00:07:57.466 --> 00:07:58.236 A:middle
on the bend bundle.

00:07:59.216 --> 00:08:00.266 A:middle
That gives you an url that you

00:08:00.266 --> 00:08:01.776 A:middle
can just past through to a data

00:08:01.776 --> 00:08:03.626 A:middle
object and you can read in that

00:08:03.626 --> 00:08:05.646 A:middle
encrypted binary data to a

00:08:05.646 --> 00:08:06.416 A:middle
receipt object.

00:08:06.416 --> 00:08:08.016 A:middle
So now you've got that encrypted

00:08:08.016 --> 00:08:09.846 A:middle
binary data in memory ready to

00:08:10.176 --> 00:08:11.296 A:middle
act on.

00:08:13.156 --> 00:08:14.726 A:middle
A couple of tips if you do want

00:08:14.726 --> 00:08:15.766 A:middle
to use OpenSSL.

00:08:15.766 --> 00:08:16.496 A:middle
We're not going to go through

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:17.516 A:middle
the whole process of using

00:08:17.516 --> 00:08:20.216 A:middle
OpenSSL in this talk but OpenSSL

00:08:20.216 --> 00:08:21.646 A:middle
doesn't actually ship with iOS.

00:08:22.166 --> 00:08:23.346 A:middle
You have to build it and include

00:08:23.346 --> 00:08:24.536 A:middle
it in your app yourself.

00:08:25.066 --> 00:08:26.656 A:middle
If you are building it, remember

00:08:26.656 --> 00:08:27.866 A:middle
to build as your own static

00:08:27.866 --> 00:08:29.156 A:middle
library for your application and

00:08:29.156 --> 00:08:30.266 A:middle
not a dynamic library.

00:08:30.266 --> 00:08:31.836 A:middle
If it was a dynamic library,

00:08:31.836 --> 00:08:32.756 A:middle
it's much easier for someone to

00:08:32.756 --> 00:08:34.176 A:middle
come along and switch out that

00:08:34.176 --> 00:08:35.846 A:middle
dynamic library with a phony one

00:08:36.096 --> 00:08:38.166 A:middle
than say, you know, messing with

00:08:38.166 --> 00:08:39.586 A:middle
the actual methods inside your

00:08:39.586 --> 00:08:40.556 A:middle
own application binary.

00:08:40.556 --> 00:08:42.016 A:middle
So a static library will mean

00:08:42.016 --> 00:08:43.186 A:middle
that that binary data's wrapped

00:08:43.186 --> 00:08:44.626 A:middle
up with your own application and

00:08:44.626 --> 00:08:45.656 A:middle
it's much harder for someone to

00:08:45.656 --> 00:08:46.966 A:middle
come along and switch out your

00:08:46.966 --> 00:08:47.966 A:middle
OpenSSL instance.

00:08:49.486 --> 00:08:50.296 A:middle
When it comes to the actual

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:51.466 A:middle
certificate check, you can

00:08:51.466 --> 00:08:52.386 A:middle
download the Apple Root

00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:53.446 A:middle
certificate authority's

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.146 A:middle
certificate from the Apple site.

00:08:55.476 --> 00:08:56.476 A:middle
And you can use that certificate

00:08:56.476 --> 00:08:57.616 A:middle
to actually perform that check

00:08:57.656 --> 00:08:59.816 A:middle
using OpenSSL to see that it is

00:08:59.816 --> 00:09:01.056 A:middle
a verified document from Apple.

00:09:01.886 --> 00:09:03.156 A:middle
If you are bundling in the app,

00:09:03.156 --> 00:09:04.316 A:middle
just one note here that be

00:09:04.316 --> 00:09:06.226 A:middle
mindful about the expiry date on

00:09:06.226 --> 00:09:07.246 A:middle
the actual certificate that

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:09.146 A:middle
you're including with a bundled

00:09:09.146 --> 00:09:09.686 A:middle
application.

00:09:11.076 --> 00:09:12.266 A:middle
There is plenty of documentation

00:09:12.266 --> 00:09:12.936 A:middle
online for this.

00:09:12.936 --> 00:09:14.356 A:middle
In fact, we had a session here a

00:09:14.356 --> 00:09:15.816 A:middle
couple of years where we built

00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:17.396 A:middle
OpenSSL here on stage just in a

00:09:17.396 --> 00:09:19.146 A:middle
live demo and did these checks

00:09:19.146 --> 00:09:19.726 A:middle
here on stage.

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:20.866 A:middle
So it's a much simple process

00:09:20.916 --> 00:09:21.576 A:middle
than you might think.

00:09:21.576 --> 00:09:22.736 A:middle
So I'd encourage you to check

00:09:22.736 --> 00:09:24.366 A:middle
out those previous sessions on

00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:25.526 A:middle
receipt validation to see how

00:09:25.526 --> 00:09:27.846 A:middle
that might be done.

00:09:28.056 --> 00:09:28.926 A:middle
When it comes to prebuilt

00:09:28.926 --> 00:09:30.096 A:middle
solutions, I'm sure some of you

00:09:30.096 --> 00:09:31.746 A:middle
in here have tried integrating

00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:32.936 A:middle
in-app purchases and probably

00:09:33.336 --> 00:09:35.116 A:middle
maybe go on Get Hub and found a

00:09:35.336 --> 00:09:36.456 A:middle
solution that's prebuilt that

00:09:36.456 --> 00:09:37.506 A:middle
can do a lot of these checks for

00:09:37.506 --> 00:09:37.636 A:middle
you.

00:09:38.146 --> 00:09:39.866 A:middle
Just remember when you're

00:09:39.866 --> 00:09:41.206 A:middle
downloading prebuilt solutions

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:42.276 A:middle
that convenience comes at a

00:09:42.276 --> 00:09:42.746 A:middle
price.

00:09:43.946 --> 00:09:45.826 A:middle
And so reusing code like this

00:09:45.826 --> 00:09:46.776 A:middle
brings with it any bugs and

00:09:46.776 --> 00:09:47.546 A:middle
vulnerabilities.

00:09:47.546 --> 00:09:48.816 A:middle
And that's especially important

00:09:48.816 --> 00:09:50.136 A:middle
when it comes to transactional

00:09:50.266 --> 00:09:51.506 A:middle
APIs like StoreKit.

00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:53.646 A:middle
Can you imagine if every jeweler

00:09:53.646 --> 00:09:54.986 A:middle
around the country used the same

00:09:54.986 --> 00:09:56.006 A:middle
lock on their safe?

00:09:56.186 --> 00:09:57.286 A:middle
And then a single exploit was

00:09:57.286 --> 00:09:58.946 A:middle
found on that one particular

00:09:58.946 --> 00:09:59.216 A:middle
lock.

00:09:59.216 --> 00:10:00.426 A:middle
Suddenly every jeweler around

00:10:00.426 --> 00:10:01.816 A:middle
the country has their jewels

00:10:01.816 --> 00:10:03.436 A:middle
vulnerable to the same single

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:03.946 A:middle
exploit.

00:10:03.946 --> 00:10:06.026 A:middle
So it's important for you when

00:10:06.026 --> 00:10:06.906 A:middle
you're doing this to know and

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.076 A:middle
own the risks as you build it.

00:10:08.076 --> 00:10:09.496 A:middle
And remember that while you're

00:10:09.496 --> 00:10:11.126 A:middle
building these integrations with

00:10:11.126 --> 00:10:12.646 A:middle
StoreKit, it's your revenue

00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:12.986 A:middle
stream.

00:10:12.986 --> 00:10:14.116 A:middle
And so people who are building

00:10:14.646 --> 00:10:16.346 A:middle
these prebuilt solutions are not

00:10:16.346 --> 00:10:17.476 A:middle
as inclined to be worried about

00:10:17.476 --> 00:10:18.356 A:middle
your money as you are.

00:10:22.336 --> 00:10:23.436 A:middle
When you're verifying the

00:10:23.436 --> 00:10:24.376 A:middle
receipt -- the actual

00:10:24.376 --> 00:10:26.046 A:middle
certificate used to sign the

00:10:26.046 --> 00:10:27.956 A:middle
receipt, a couple of tips here.

00:10:28.626 --> 00:10:29.576 A:middle
You don't need to actually check

00:10:29.576 --> 00:10:30.906 A:middle
the expiry date of the

00:10:30.906 --> 00:10:32.316 A:middle
certificate used to sign the

00:10:32.316 --> 00:10:32.786 A:middle
receipt.

00:10:34.546 --> 00:10:35.316 A:middle
What do I mean by that?

00:10:35.316 --> 00:10:36.496 A:middle
Well, if you think about a

00:10:36.496 --> 00:10:37.896 A:middle
receipt that's encrypted at a

00:10:37.896 --> 00:10:38.896 A:middle
point in time, let's say two

00:10:38.896 --> 00:10:40.706 A:middle
years ago and then someone signs

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:41.566 A:middle
it with a certificate that's

00:10:41.566 --> 00:10:42.346 A:middle
valid at the time.

00:10:42.666 --> 00:10:43.906 A:middle
Then that certificate expires a

00:10:43.906 --> 00:10:44.596 A:middle
little while later.

00:10:45.246 --> 00:10:46.236 A:middle
Just because the certificate's

00:10:46.236 --> 00:10:47.286 A:middle
now expired and we're in the

00:10:47.286 --> 00:10:48.676 A:middle
future, doesn't make the receipt

00:10:48.796 --> 00:10:49.986 A:middle
actually any less valid.

00:10:50.286 --> 00:10:51.396 A:middle
What's really important here is

00:10:51.396 --> 00:10:52.676 A:middle
not whether the certificate's

00:10:52.676 --> 00:10:54.316 A:middle
still valid right now, it's

00:10:54.316 --> 00:10:55.536 A:middle
really only important as to

00:10:55.536 --> 00:10:56.836 A:middle
whether it was valid at the time

00:10:57.006 --> 00:10:57.966 A:middle
the receipt was made.

00:10:57.966 --> 00:10:58.856 A:middle
So if you're going to compare

00:10:58.856 --> 00:11:00.256 A:middle
that date to anything, compare

00:11:00.256 --> 00:11:01.726 A:middle
it to a purchase date of a

00:11:01.726 --> 00:11:03.126 A:middle
transaction inside the receipt

00:11:03.126 --> 00:11:04.076 A:middle
to make sure it was valid at the

00:11:04.076 --> 00:11:04.776 A:middle
time of signing.

00:11:05.326 --> 00:11:08.216 A:middle
Let's take look inside the

00:11:08.216 --> 00:11:09.306 A:middle
actual payload of the receipt.

00:11:09.306 --> 00:11:10.846 A:middle
So this is the ASN.1 encoding

00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:11.406 A:middle
that I mentioned.

00:11:12.066 --> 00:11:13.196 A:middle
All this is, is really, a series

00:11:13.196 --> 00:11:14.226 A:middle
of types and values.

00:11:14.566 --> 00:11:15.356 A:middle
Much like dictionary.

00:11:15.356 --> 00:11:16.376 A:middle
You can just think about it as

00:11:16.616 --> 00:11:17.496 A:middle
keys and values like a

00:11:17.496 --> 00:11:18.256 A:middle
dictionary would have.

00:11:18.726 --> 00:11:19.596 A:middle
And you could read out these

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.056 A:middle
particular values based on the

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:21.646 A:middle
different types.

00:11:22.596 --> 00:11:24.026 A:middle
So now that you've verified that

00:11:24.026 --> 00:11:25.436 A:middle
the actual document is signed

00:11:25.436 --> 00:11:26.676 A:middle
using the right certificate from

00:11:26.676 --> 00:11:28.826 A:middle
Apple, you need to verify that

00:11:28.826 --> 00:11:31.266 A:middle
the application used to make

00:11:31.266 --> 00:11:32.116 A:middle
this receipt is the one the

00:11:32.116 --> 00:11:32.746 A:middle
user's running on.

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:33.626 A:middle
So how do we do that?

00:11:34.946 --> 00:11:36.166 A:middle
To verify that this receipt's

00:11:36.166 --> 00:11:37.396 A:middle
for this application, there's

00:11:37.436 --> 00:11:38.396 A:middle
two particular types of

00:11:38.396 --> 00:11:38.926 A:middle
attributes.

00:11:39.016 --> 00:11:40.766 A:middle
Type 2 and 3, and they contain

00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:42.306 A:middle
the bundle identifier that this

00:11:42.306 --> 00:11:43.926 A:middle
receipt's for and also the

00:11:43.926 --> 00:11:45.026 A:middle
bundle version that this

00:11:45.026 --> 00:11:45.586 A:middle
receipt's for.

00:11:46.466 --> 00:11:47.286 A:middle
So what you need to do is

00:11:47.286 --> 00:11:48.986 A:middle
compare these two particular

00:11:48.986 --> 00:11:50.576 A:middle
attributes to hard coded ones

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:51.886 A:middle
inside your application.

00:11:52.446 --> 00:11:53.526 A:middle
It's important to use hard coded

00:11:53.526 --> 00:11:54.636 A:middle
values here because of the same

00:11:54.636 --> 00:11:55.646 A:middle
principle I mentioned earlier.

00:11:56.806 --> 00:11:58.166 A:middle
If it's an info plist file, it's

00:11:58.166 --> 00:11:59.026 A:middle
much easier for someone to

00:11:59.026 --> 00:12:00.656 A:middle
switch out a plist file with

00:12:00.656 --> 00:12:01.986 A:middle
phony values to match a phony

00:12:01.986 --> 00:12:04.696 A:middle
receipt than it is to switch out

00:12:04.696 --> 00:12:05.776 A:middle
something to match hard coded

00:12:05.776 --> 00:12:06.216 A:middle
values.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.866 A:middle
But if you check these two

00:12:08.866 --> 00:12:10.046 A:middle
things against hard coded values

00:12:10.046 --> 00:12:11.306 A:middle
and they match then great.

00:12:11.306 --> 00:12:12.316 A:middle
You verified that the

00:12:12.316 --> 00:12:13.996 A:middle
application is correct.

00:12:14.886 --> 00:12:15.996 A:middle
The next step is to verify the

00:12:15.996 --> 00:12:17.296 A:middle
device that the user's on and

00:12:17.296 --> 00:12:18.266 A:middle
verify that this document

00:12:18.266 --> 00:12:18.716 A:middle
matches.

00:12:19.316 --> 00:12:20.956 A:middle
We do that using types 4 and 5.

00:12:21.196 --> 00:12:22.816 A:middle
It's a similar process but this

00:12:22.866 --> 00:12:23.706 A:middle
time, the one that we want to

00:12:23.706 --> 00:12:24.996 A:middle
check is attribute number 5.

00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:27.046 A:middle
Now attribute number 5 is

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:28.716 A:middle
actually a SHA-1 hash of these

00:12:28.796 --> 00:12:29.536 A:middle
three values.

00:12:29.536 --> 00:12:31.006 A:middle
It's a SHA-1 hash of the bundle

00:12:31.076 --> 00:12:33.556 A:middle
ID, the device ID, we provide

00:12:33.556 --> 00:12:34.906 A:middle
APIs for the device ID.

00:12:34.906 --> 00:12:36.896 A:middle
And the third one is an opaque

00:12:36.896 --> 00:12:38.636 A:middle
value, which is really just the

00:12:38.636 --> 00:12:40.106 A:middle
attribute in type number 4.

00:12:40.246 --> 00:12:41.816 A:middle
Now the reason we do that, it's

00:12:41.816 --> 00:12:42.836 A:middle
a little bit of cryptographic

00:12:42.836 --> 00:12:43.376 A:middle
entropy.

00:12:43.376 --> 00:12:45.036 A:middle
A bit of secret salt that allows

00:12:45.036 --> 00:12:46.466 A:middle
that SHA-1 hash to change over

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:47.896 A:middle
time, even the bundle ID and the

00:12:47.896 --> 00:12:49.076 A:middle
device ID aren't changing.

00:12:49.566 --> 00:12:50.656 A:middle
So it just makes this process a

00:12:50.656 --> 00:12:51.466 A:middle
little more secure.

00:12:52.696 --> 00:12:53.866 A:middle
And so accordingly, this SHA-1

00:12:53.866 --> 00:12:55.646 A:middle
hash is unique to this app on

00:12:55.646 --> 00:12:56.236 A:middle
the device.

00:12:56.786 --> 00:12:58.156 A:middle
And what you do is you create

00:12:58.156 --> 00:12:59.626 A:middle
that SHA-1 hash using your own,

00:12:59.936 --> 00:13:01.096 A:middle
you know, hard coded values.

00:13:01.096 --> 00:13:01.966 A:middle
The same technique that we did

00:13:01.966 --> 00:13:03.786 A:middle
before and you compare it to the

00:13:03.786 --> 00:13:04.806 A:middle
one in type number 5.

00:13:04.806 --> 00:13:06.666 A:middle
And if they match, then that's

00:13:06.666 --> 00:13:06.936 A:middle
it.

00:13:06.936 --> 00:13:08.666 A:middle
You verified that the device the

00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:09.956 A:middle
user's on matches the one the

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.456 A:middle
receipt is for.

00:13:12.716 --> 00:13:13.806 A:middle
So now you've done those three

00:13:13.806 --> 00:13:14.306 A:middle
checks.

00:13:15.666 --> 00:13:16.926 A:middle
That's the process of validating

00:13:16.926 --> 00:13:17.936 A:middle
the receipt on the device.

00:13:17.936 --> 00:13:18.696 A:middle
You now know that this is a

00:13:18.696 --> 00:13:20.096 A:middle
document that you can trust when

00:13:20.096 --> 00:13:21.196 A:middle
you're reading out further

00:13:21.196 --> 00:13:22.146 A:middle
information from it.

00:13:22.306 --> 00:13:23.326 A:middle
So let's take a look at the next

00:13:23.326 --> 00:13:25.306 A:middle
step which is to actually update

00:13:25.306 --> 00:13:27.036 A:middle
state and inspect the contents

00:13:27.266 --> 00:13:28.826 A:middle
of these in-app purchases inside

00:13:28.826 --> 00:13:29.296 A:middle
the receipt.

00:13:31.006 --> 00:13:32.136 A:middle
Let's dive back into what the

00:13:32.446 --> 00:13:33.826 A:middle
payload of the receipt contains.

00:13:34.966 --> 00:13:36.406 A:middle
The receipt contains a specific

00:13:36.406 --> 00:13:38.436 A:middle
type, type 17 for every

00:13:38.436 --> 00:13:40.476 A:middle
transaction that occurs for this

00:13:40.476 --> 00:13:42.196 A:middle
user on this device.

00:13:43.106 --> 00:13:45.606 A:middle
Now in each type 17, the actual

00:13:45.606 --> 00:13:47.796 A:middle
payload is another ASN.1 encoded

00:13:47.836 --> 00:13:48.466 A:middle
container.

00:13:49.106 --> 00:13:51.316 A:middle
And inside of this, there's a

00:13:51.316 --> 00:13:53.246 A:middle
bunch of types and values that

00:13:53.246 --> 00:13:54.626 A:middle
are associated just for this

00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:55.666 A:middle
specific transaction in

00:13:55.666 --> 00:13:56.056 A:middle
question.

00:13:56.056 --> 00:13:57.106 A:middle
So we have things like a

00:13:57.106 --> 00:13:58.756 A:middle
quantity, a product identifier,

00:13:58.756 --> 00:13:59.686 A:middle
a transaction ID.

00:13:59.986 --> 00:14:01.066 A:middle
So these are values that you can

00:14:01.066 --> 00:14:03.476 A:middle
use to verify that a transaction

00:14:03.666 --> 00:14:04.806 A:middle
exists in the real world.

00:14:05.806 --> 00:14:06.866 A:middle
One more to call out while I'm

00:14:06.866 --> 00:14:08.196 A:middle
here is type 1708.

00:14:08.196 --> 00:14:09.436 A:middle
This is particularly important

00:14:09.436 --> 00:14:10.166 A:middle
if you're dealing with auto

00:14:10.166 --> 00:14:11.346 A:middle
renewable subscriptions.

00:14:11.816 --> 00:14:13.146 A:middle
This contains the expiry date

00:14:13.346 --> 00:14:14.936 A:middle
for a particular transaction for

00:14:14.936 --> 00:14:15.836 A:middle
a particular billing period.

00:14:15.836 --> 00:14:17.306 A:middle
And we'll come back to talking

00:14:17.306 --> 00:14:18.286 A:middle
about subscriptions in a bit.

00:14:19.556 --> 00:14:20.146 A:middle
If you want to know more

00:14:20.146 --> 00:14:21.406 A:middle
information about all the

00:14:21.406 --> 00:14:22.136 A:middle
different types that are

00:14:22.136 --> 00:14:23.046 A:middle
included here, I'd just

00:14:23.326 --> 00:14:24.156 A:middle
encourage you to check out the

00:14:24.156 --> 00:14:25.446 A:middle
Receipt Validation programming

00:14:25.446 --> 00:14:26.006 A:middle
guide online.

00:14:26.316 --> 00:14:27.406 A:middle
And we go through all the

00:14:27.406 --> 00:14:28.086 A:middle
different types that are

00:14:28.086 --> 00:14:29.496 A:middle
actually included in the

00:14:29.496 --> 00:14:29.886 A:middle
receipt.

00:14:30.406 --> 00:14:32.896 A:middle
But now that you can read all

00:14:32.896 --> 00:14:35.226 A:middle
these transactions, it's up to

00:14:35.226 --> 00:14:36.566 A:middle
you to use those to verify the

00:14:36.566 --> 00:14:38.396 A:middle
content that StoreKit's telling

00:14:38.396 --> 00:14:38.866 A:middle
you the user's bought.

00:14:38.866 --> 00:14:40.656 A:middle
So what you do is you take the

00:14:40.656 --> 00:14:41.796 A:middle
transaction that's appeared

00:14:41.796 --> 00:14:42.486 A:middle
through this updated

00:14:42.486 --> 00:14:43.546 A:middle
transaction's call at the

00:14:43.546 --> 00:14:45.266 A:middle
beginning of the process and all

00:14:45.266 --> 00:14:46.446 A:middle
you have to do is compare all

00:14:46.446 --> 00:14:47.976 A:middle
those values to the ones inside

00:14:47.976 --> 00:14:48.426 A:middle
the receipt.

00:14:48.426 --> 00:14:49.386 A:middle
So you can use things like the

00:14:49.386 --> 00:14:50.726 A:middle
transaction ID, the purchase

00:14:50.726 --> 00:14:52.336 A:middle
date, the product identifier

00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:53.456 A:middle
that it's saying the user

00:14:53.456 --> 00:14:54.856 A:middle
bought, and if you can verify

00:14:54.856 --> 00:14:55.806 A:middle
that there's a transaction that

00:14:55.806 --> 00:14:56.926 A:middle
matches then great.

00:14:56.926 --> 00:14:58.456 A:middle
You've got a proof -- a document

00:14:58.456 --> 00:14:59.526 A:middle
proving that the user actually

00:14:59.526 --> 00:15:00.446 A:middle
purchased it and money's

00:15:00.446 --> 00:15:01.436 A:middle
actually changed hands.

00:15:01.436 --> 00:15:03.076 A:middle
So you can trust the transaction

00:15:03.076 --> 00:15:04.596 A:middle
that StoreKit's telling you.

00:15:05.716 --> 00:15:06.516 A:middle
When you're dealing with

00:15:06.516 --> 00:15:08.056 A:middle
subscriptions a common question

00:15:08.056 --> 00:15:09.686 A:middle
at this point is does my user

00:15:09.686 --> 00:15:10.756 A:middle
have an active subscription.

00:15:11.696 --> 00:15:13.236 A:middle
Well one thing just to note

00:15:13.236 --> 00:15:13.456 A:middle
here.

00:15:13.456 --> 00:15:14.356 A:middle
Just remember that a valid

00:15:14.356 --> 00:15:15.996 A:middle
receipt is not the same thing as

00:15:15.996 --> 00:15:17.156 A:middle
having a subscribed user.

00:15:17.636 --> 00:15:18.646 A:middle
So there's a bit of confusion

00:15:18.646 --> 00:15:19.216 A:middle
sometimes.

00:15:19.436 --> 00:15:20.566 A:middle
If you can validate the receipt

00:15:20.566 --> 00:15:21.176 A:middle
that doesn't mean that the

00:15:21.176 --> 00:15:22.576 A:middle
user's actually paid anything.

00:15:22.876 --> 00:15:23.746 A:middle
You know every app has a

00:15:23.746 --> 00:15:24.156 A:middle
receipt.

00:15:24.236 --> 00:15:25.526 A:middle
It contains information about

00:15:25.766 --> 00:15:27.446 A:middle
original application purchases

00:15:27.446 --> 00:15:28.406 A:middle
even for free apps.

00:15:29.016 --> 00:15:30.026 A:middle
It's the data inside the

00:15:30.026 --> 00:15:30.346 A:middle
receipt.

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:31.456 A:middle
These transactions that's going

00:15:31.456 --> 00:15:32.256 A:middle
to tell you about the

00:15:32.256 --> 00:15:33.386 A:middle
subscription state of the user.

00:15:33.386 --> 00:15:35.846 A:middle
Now how do we find out that

00:15:35.846 --> 00:15:36.576 A:middle
subscription state?

00:15:36.576 --> 00:15:37.896 A:middle
You could take those

00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:39.476 A:middle
transactions and you want to

00:15:39.476 --> 00:15:40.366 A:middle
group them together by the

00:15:40.366 --> 00:15:42.436 A:middle
original transaction ID field.

00:15:43.306 --> 00:15:44.676 A:middle
This field just contains that

00:15:44.746 --> 00:15:46.086 A:middle
first transaction ID for a

00:15:46.086 --> 00:15:47.206 A:middle
particular auto renewable

00:15:47.206 --> 00:15:48.726 A:middle
subscription that a user used.

00:15:48.726 --> 00:15:49.666 A:middle
You can kind of think of this as

00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:51.526 A:middle
being like a subscription ID

00:15:51.676 --> 00:15:52.666 A:middle
that you can use to reference

00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:53.746 A:middle
and group together these

00:15:53.746 --> 00:15:54.466 A:middle
transactions.

00:15:55.506 --> 00:15:56.516 A:middle
So you can grab those

00:15:56.766 --> 00:15:58.006 A:middle
transactions and you want to

00:15:58.006 --> 00:15:58.966 A:middle
look for the one that has the

00:15:58.966 --> 00:16:00.166 A:middle
latest expiry date.

00:16:00.456 --> 00:16:02.316 A:middle
Now this is an indication of the

00:16:02.316 --> 00:16:03.636 A:middle
latest transaction that's taken

00:16:03.636 --> 00:16:03.846 A:middle
place.

00:16:03.846 --> 00:16:05.026 A:middle
So if you see an expiry date in

00:16:05.026 --> 00:16:06.606 A:middle
the future, that's an indication

00:16:06.606 --> 00:16:07.596 A:middle
that the user's in the middle of

00:16:07.596 --> 00:16:08.746 A:middle
a billing period and they have

00:16:08.746 --> 00:16:09.646 A:middle
an active subscription.

00:16:10.116 --> 00:16:11.856 A:middle
Now if you find an expiry date

00:16:11.856 --> 00:16:13.256 A:middle
in the past, that's an

00:16:13.256 --> 00:16:14.276 A:middle
indication that there's been no

00:16:14.276 --> 00:16:15.356 A:middle
transaction since then.

00:16:15.356 --> 00:16:16.516 A:middle
So the user's subscription's

00:16:16.516 --> 00:16:17.276 A:middle
actually lapsed.

00:16:18.176 --> 00:16:20.416 A:middle
Now if you do find this, you can

00:16:20.416 --> 00:16:21.756 A:middle
do what we say -- what we call a

00:16:21.756 --> 00:16:22.866 A:middle
receive refresh request.

00:16:24.056 --> 00:16:25.346 A:middle
And this'll go fetch the latest

00:16:25.346 --> 00:16:26.556 A:middle
copy of the receipt just as a

00:16:26.556 --> 00:16:27.956 A:middle
double check and you can repeat

00:16:27.956 --> 00:16:28.856 A:middle
those steps of receipt

00:16:28.856 --> 00:16:31.156 A:middle
validation and check these steps

00:16:31.186 --> 00:16:33.266 A:middle
that we just called above to see

00:16:33.266 --> 00:16:34.306 A:middle
if any new transactions have

00:16:34.306 --> 00:16:34.716 A:middle
appeared.

00:16:36.316 --> 00:16:37.696 A:middle
Now there is one caveat when

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:38.596 A:middle
you're maintaining a

00:16:38.596 --> 00:16:39.996 A:middle
subscription state on the device

00:16:39.996 --> 00:16:40.396 A:middle
like this.

00:16:40.396 --> 00:16:41.576 A:middle
We talked about, you know,

00:16:41.576 --> 00:16:42.436 A:middle
expiry dates.

00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:43.396 A:middle
And we've talked about purchase

00:16:43.396 --> 00:16:43.716 A:middle
dates.

00:16:44.046 --> 00:16:45.396 A:middle
Well if you're doing this purely

00:16:45.396 --> 00:16:47.116 A:middle
on the device, the only data you

00:16:47.116 --> 00:16:48.196 A:middle
actually have to compare these

00:16:48.196 --> 00:16:49.446 A:middle
to is the user system data.

00:16:49.986 --> 00:16:51.086 A:middle
So what's stopping the user from

00:16:51.086 --> 00:16:52.306 A:middle
just winding their clock back

00:16:52.586 --> 00:16:53.846 A:middle
and putting themselves into an

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:54.926 A:middle
active subscription period?

00:16:56.726 --> 00:16:57.936 A:middle
Not a lot, unfortunately.

00:16:58.216 --> 00:16:59.796 A:middle
So if this is a problem for you,

00:16:59.796 --> 00:17:01.176 A:middle
it's probably likely that you're

00:17:01.176 --> 00:17:01.906 A:middle
going to need to look at some

00:17:01.906 --> 00:17:03.036 A:middle
kind of service side solution.

00:17:03.146 --> 00:17:04.376 A:middle
Maybe look at receipt validation

00:17:04.376 --> 00:17:05.746 A:middle
on your server or at least, some

00:17:05.746 --> 00:17:06.966 A:middle
check to actually get timed --

00:17:07.146 --> 00:17:08.356 A:middle
time and date from your server

00:17:08.356 --> 00:17:09.076 A:middle
to check it against.

00:17:09.076 --> 00:17:11.726 A:middle
When it comes to actually

00:17:11.796 --> 00:17:13.136 A:middle
refreshing the receipt like I

00:17:13.136 --> 00:17:14.496 A:middle
just mentioned, you can do this

00:17:14.496 --> 00:17:15.926 A:middle
if the receipt doesn't exist or

00:17:15.926 --> 00:17:17.196 A:middle
it's invalid or maybe you're

00:17:17.196 --> 00:17:17.996 A:middle
searching for that extra

00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:18.586 A:middle
transaction.

00:17:18.586 --> 00:17:20.086 A:middle
It will require a network

00:17:20.086 --> 00:17:21.116 A:middle
request because it goes and

00:17:21.116 --> 00:17:22.186 A:middle
fetches a new receipt from the

00:17:22.186 --> 00:17:22.736 A:middle
App Store.

00:17:22.976 --> 00:17:24.866 A:middle
And it will require sign-in from

00:17:24.866 --> 00:17:26.626 A:middle
the user which means that you

00:17:26.626 --> 00:17:27.576 A:middle
should be very careful about how

00:17:27.576 --> 00:17:29.226 A:middle
often you do this and avoid

00:17:29.226 --> 00:17:31.066 A:middle
continuous loops of validating

00:17:31.066 --> 00:17:31.676 A:middle
and refreshing.

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:32.566 A:middle
If you're doing that example

00:17:32.566 --> 00:17:33.686 A:middle
that we just spoke about where

00:17:33.686 --> 00:17:34.906 A:middle
you're looking for that expiry

00:17:34.906 --> 00:17:36.146 A:middle
date, make sure that if you

00:17:36.146 --> 00:17:37.086 A:middle
don't find it that you don't

00:17:37.086 --> 00:17:38.746 A:middle
just keep refreshing the receipt

00:17:38.746 --> 00:17:40.406 A:middle
refresh request over and over

00:17:40.406 --> 00:17:41.076 A:middle
again because it'll keep

00:17:41.116 --> 00:17:42.216 A:middle
prompting the user to log in.

00:17:42.506 --> 00:17:43.536 A:middle
So just issue one of these

00:17:43.536 --> 00:17:45.046 A:middle
requests if you're going to do

00:17:45.046 --> 00:17:46.356 A:middle
it and this is what it looks

00:17:46.356 --> 00:17:46.976 A:middle
like in code.

00:17:47.786 --> 00:17:48.276 A:middle
You create an

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:50.076 A:middle
SKReceiptRefreshRequest object.

00:17:50.556 --> 00:17:51.656 A:middle
You set a delegate on it and you

00:17:51.656 --> 00:17:53.046 A:middle
just kick it off using the start

00:17:53.126 --> 00:17:53.306 A:middle
method.

00:17:53.596 --> 00:17:56.266 A:middle
On mac iOS if you're developing

00:17:56.266 --> 00:17:58.476 A:middle
for the Mac, same principles

00:17:58.476 --> 00:17:58.726 A:middle
apply.

00:17:58.726 --> 00:18:00.026 A:middle
You can do this if the receipt's

00:18:00.026 --> 00:18:00.436 A:middle
invalid.

00:18:01.296 --> 00:18:02.596 A:middle
It'll require a network request

00:18:02.596 --> 00:18:03.866 A:middle
and it will prompt the user to

00:18:03.866 --> 00:18:05.966 A:middle
actually log in as well but in

00:18:05.966 --> 00:18:06.816 A:middle
this case, it's a little

00:18:06.816 --> 00:18:07.086 A:middle
different.

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.476 A:middle
The API what you do is you exit

00:18:08.476 --> 00:18:10.116 A:middle
your application using the code

00:18:10.116 --> 00:18:11.216 A:middle
173.

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:12.796 A:middle
And that looks like this.

00:18:12.796 --> 00:18:14.056 A:middle
So this'll exit your

00:18:14.056 --> 00:18:14.626 A:middle
application.

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:15.666 A:middle
This will trigger StoreKit in

00:18:15.666 --> 00:18:16.546 A:middle
the background to go and

00:18:16.546 --> 00:18:18.076 A:middle
download a new receipt to the

00:18:18.076 --> 00:18:19.766 A:middle
Mac and then it'll prompt the

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.286 A:middle
user to log in and launch your

00:18:21.286 --> 00:18:21.516 A:middle
app again.

00:18:21.516 --> 00:18:24.476 A:middle
Now at this point I just want to

00:18:24.476 --> 00:18:25.936 A:middle
touch on a couple of differences

00:18:25.936 --> 00:18:26.826 A:middle
here between restoring

00:18:26.826 --> 00:18:28.496 A:middle
transactions and refreshing the

00:18:28.496 --> 00:18:28.986 A:middle
receipt.

00:18:29.046 --> 00:18:29.936 A:middle
These can be sometimes be

00:18:29.936 --> 00:18:30.366 A:middle
confused.

00:18:30.366 --> 00:18:32.116 A:middle
These are two separate APIs.

00:18:33.016 --> 00:18:34.256 A:middle
So restoring completed

00:18:34.256 --> 00:18:35.936 A:middle
transactions which is an API we

00:18:35.936 --> 00:18:37.146 A:middle
looked at in the What's New in

00:18:37.146 --> 00:18:38.846 A:middle
StoreKit talk this morning, this

00:18:38.846 --> 00:18:40.466 A:middle
is an API on the SK payment

00:18:40.466 --> 00:18:42.506 A:middle
queue whereas the receipt

00:18:42.506 --> 00:18:44.036 A:middle
refresh request is its own

00:18:44.036 --> 00:18:45.396 A:middle
instance that you create and you

00:18:45.396 --> 00:18:46.526 A:middle
kick it off using the start

00:18:46.526 --> 00:18:46.786 A:middle
method.

00:18:46.906 --> 00:18:48.196 A:middle
And they accomplish slightly

00:18:48.196 --> 00:18:48.786 A:middle
different things.

00:18:48.926 --> 00:18:50.156 A:middle
So restoring completed

00:18:50.156 --> 00:18:52.346 A:middle
transactions causes all the

00:18:52.346 --> 00:18:53.486 A:middle
completed transactions that have

00:18:53.486 --> 00:18:54.946 A:middle
occurred for a user to appear

00:18:54.946 --> 00:18:55.886 A:middle
back on that updated

00:18:55.886 --> 00:18:57.696 A:middle
transactions call back for you

00:18:57.696 --> 00:18:58.716 A:middle
to be able to process.

00:18:59.756 --> 00:19:01.036 A:middle
Whereas the receipt refresh

00:19:01.036 --> 00:19:02.446 A:middle
request is really just used to

00:19:02.446 --> 00:19:03.926 A:middle
go and fetch that new receipt

00:19:03.926 --> 00:19:04.316 A:middle
document.

00:19:04.316 --> 00:19:05.896 A:middle
That encrypted binary code for

00:19:05.896 --> 00:19:07.116 A:middle
you to be able to check the

00:19:07.276 --> 00:19:08.086 A:middle
contents of.

00:19:09.406 --> 00:19:10.266 A:middle
And there's also a slight

00:19:10.266 --> 00:19:11.506 A:middle
difference to actually what they

00:19:11.506 --> 00:19:12.006 A:middle
include.

00:19:12.006 --> 00:19:13.076 A:middle
So when you're restoring

00:19:13.076 --> 00:19:14.856 A:middle
completed transactions, this

00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:16.326 A:middle
restores only non-consumerable

00:19:16.326 --> 00:19:17.536 A:middle
products and auto renewable

00:19:17.536 --> 00:19:18.556 A:middle
subscription products.

00:19:19.746 --> 00:19:21.006 A:middle
Whereas a receipt refresh

00:19:21.006 --> 00:19:22.696 A:middle
request has both of those but it

00:19:22.696 --> 00:19:23.426 A:middle
also includes also any

00:19:23.426 --> 00:19:24.806 A:middle
non-renewing subscription

00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:26.466 A:middle
entries in the receipt.

00:19:27.146 --> 00:19:28.626 A:middle
So you'll notice that consumable

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.136 A:middle
products are absent from both of

00:19:30.136 --> 00:19:31.226 A:middle
these types of requests.

00:19:31.416 --> 00:19:31.936 A:middle
If you're dealing with

00:19:31.936 --> 00:19:33.706 A:middle
consumable product purchases,

00:19:34.226 --> 00:19:35.246 A:middle
they're just going to appear

00:19:35.246 --> 00:19:36.696 A:middle
both in the updated transactions

00:19:36.946 --> 00:19:38.426 A:middle
and on the receipt at the time

00:19:38.426 --> 00:19:39.106 A:middle
of purchase.

00:19:39.286 --> 00:19:40.066 A:middle
So you kind of have that one

00:19:40.066 --> 00:19:41.956 A:middle
chance to actually verify the

00:19:41.956 --> 00:19:43.186 A:middle
consumable product and it won't

00:19:43.186 --> 00:19:44.576 A:middle
be restored for either of these

00:19:44.576 --> 00:19:44.916 A:middle
calls.

00:19:46.176 --> 00:19:47.356 A:middle
Now one other tip for dealing

00:19:47.356 --> 00:19:48.686 A:middle
with receipts is if you're

00:19:48.686 --> 00:19:49.446 A:middle
looking to switch to

00:19:49.446 --> 00:19:50.416 A:middle
subscriptions, maybe you've got

00:19:50.416 --> 00:19:51.636 A:middle
a paid application and you want

00:19:51.636 --> 00:19:52.576 A:middle
to switch it to being a

00:19:52.576 --> 00:19:54.196 A:middle
subscription model, you can use

00:19:54.196 --> 00:19:56.196 A:middle
this type 19 value in the

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.216 A:middle
application receipt.

00:19:58.586 --> 00:19:59.606 A:middle
This contains the original

00:19:59.606 --> 00:20:00.506 A:middle
application version.

00:20:00.586 --> 00:20:02.156 A:middle
So you can use this application

00:20:02.156 --> 00:20:03.396 A:middle
version that a user originally

00:20:03.396 --> 00:20:05.056 A:middle
downloaded as kind of a gate to

00:20:05.056 --> 00:20:06.496 A:middle
know as to whether you need to

00:20:06.496 --> 00:20:07.766 A:middle
provide a content based on a

00:20:07.796 --> 00:20:08.916 A:middle
paid app or based on a

00:20:08.976 --> 00:20:09.426 A:middle
subscription.

00:20:09.426 --> 00:20:10.566 A:middle
You know it's not a great

00:20:10.566 --> 00:20:11.526 A:middle
experience if you've paid for an

00:20:11.526 --> 00:20:12.856 A:middle
application and then suddenly

00:20:12.856 --> 00:20:13.766 A:middle
you lose access to that

00:20:13.766 --> 00:20:15.266 A:middle
functionality you paid for if

00:20:15.266 --> 00:20:16.226 A:middle
it's now a subscription model.

00:20:16.226 --> 00:20:17.916 A:middle
So use type 19 as a bit of a

00:20:17.916 --> 00:20:20.606 A:middle
gate to be able to supply that.

00:20:21.496 --> 00:20:22.846 A:middle
So once you've done this step,

00:20:22.846 --> 00:20:23.876 A:middle
that's the process of checking

00:20:23.876 --> 00:20:25.336 A:middle
the transaction and confirming

00:20:25.336 --> 00:20:26.206 A:middle
subscription state on the

00:20:26.206 --> 00:20:26.646 A:middle
device.

00:20:27.046 --> 00:20:28.366 A:middle
You can then go ahead to finish

00:20:28.406 --> 00:20:29.026 A:middle
the transaction.

00:20:29.026 --> 00:20:30.346 A:middle
So you've made the content

00:20:30.346 --> 00:20:31.156 A:middle
available to the user.

00:20:31.476 --> 00:20:32.856 A:middle
You've updated that subscription

00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:33.176 A:middle
state.

00:20:33.486 --> 00:20:34.376 A:middle
When it comes to finishing the

00:20:34.376 --> 00:20:36.766 A:middle
transaction, you have to

00:20:36.766 --> 00:20:37.506 A:middle
remember to finish all

00:20:37.506 --> 00:20:38.876 A:middle
transactions that come through

00:20:38.876 --> 00:20:40.356 A:middle
this flow but only do it once

00:20:40.356 --> 00:20:41.696 A:middle
you've made content available to

00:20:41.696 --> 00:20:42.026 A:middle
the user.

00:20:43.316 --> 00:20:44.446 A:middle
So maybe you're downloading

00:20:44.446 --> 00:20:45.586 A:middle
content associated with an

00:20:45.586 --> 00:20:46.216 A:middle
in-app purchase.

00:20:46.416 --> 00:20:47.506 A:middle
Make sure until that download's

00:20:47.506 --> 00:20:48.986 A:middle
completely finished before you

00:20:48.986 --> 00:20:49.846 A:middle
go ahead and finish the

00:20:49.846 --> 00:20:50.406 A:middle
transaction.

00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:52.726 A:middle
And this includes all auto

00:20:52.726 --> 00:20:53.826 A:middle
renewable subscription

00:20:53.826 --> 00:20:54.466 A:middle
transactions.

00:20:54.466 --> 00:20:55.886 A:middle
So these renewable transactions

00:20:55.886 --> 00:20:56.906 A:middle
that come in at the end of each

00:20:56.906 --> 00:20:58.296 A:middle
billing period, you still need

00:20:58.296 --> 00:20:59.036 A:middle
to finish all of these

00:20:59.036 --> 00:21:00.086 A:middle
transactions and handle them.

00:21:00.896 --> 00:21:02.016 A:middle
And if you don't, the payment

00:21:02.126 --> 00:21:03.496 A:middle
actually stays on the payment

00:21:03.496 --> 00:21:05.106 A:middle
queue and it'll keep reappearing

00:21:05.106 --> 00:21:06.356 A:middle
in the updated transactions call

00:21:06.356 --> 00:21:07.816 A:middle
back until you deal with it and

00:21:07.966 --> 00:21:09.086 A:middle
call finish transactions.

00:21:09.676 --> 00:21:11.496 A:middle
We also have specific logic

00:21:11.496 --> 00:21:12.596 A:middle
around subscription billing

00:21:12.596 --> 00:21:13.046 A:middle
retry.

00:21:13.046 --> 00:21:14.316 A:middle
So if you do have auto renewable

00:21:14.316 --> 00:21:16.026 A:middle
subscriptions, it's important

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:17.276 A:middle
that you do finish these

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:18.246 A:middle
transactions so that our

00:21:18.246 --> 00:21:20.076 A:middle
subscription billing retry logic

00:21:20.076 --> 00:21:21.326 A:middle
can continue to try and charge

00:21:21.326 --> 00:21:22.586 A:middle
user's credit cards if there's

00:21:22.586 --> 00:21:23.786 A:middle
any kind of billing error along

00:21:23.786 --> 00:21:24.086 A:middle
the way.

00:21:24.456 --> 00:21:25.736 A:middle
So this is quite important for

00:21:25.736 --> 00:21:27.046 A:middle
our end to know the state of all

00:21:27.046 --> 00:21:28.156 A:middle
these transactions.

00:21:29.036 --> 00:21:30.016 A:middle
This is what the API though

00:21:30.066 --> 00:21:30.486 A:middle
looks like.

00:21:30.696 --> 00:21:31.686 A:middle
It's just one line of code.

00:21:31.846 --> 00:21:33.156 A:middle
You can pass in that transaction

00:21:33.156 --> 00:21:34.296 A:middle
object that we received at the

00:21:34.296 --> 00:21:35.816 A:middle
start of the process to the

00:21:35.816 --> 00:21:38.116 A:middle
finish transaction method on the

00:21:38.116 --> 00:21:39.636 A:middle
SKPaymentQueue's default queue.

00:21:43.056 --> 00:21:44.316 A:middle
So that wraps up that device

00:21:44.386 --> 00:21:46.016 A:middle
flow of validating the receipt

00:21:46.016 --> 00:21:47.446 A:middle
and updating content on the

00:21:47.446 --> 00:21:48.156 A:middle
user's device.

00:21:48.336 --> 00:21:49.756 A:middle
Let's jump up now and look at

00:21:49.756 --> 00:21:51.036 A:middle
how this works in a service side

00:21:51.036 --> 00:21:51.496 A:middle
environment.

00:21:52.066 --> 00:21:53.396 A:middle
And to do this, let's just walk

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:54.206 A:middle
through a bit of an example.

00:21:56.226 --> 00:21:58.486 A:middle
Let's say I have a user here and

00:21:58.486 --> 00:22:01.396 A:middle
it's using your application and

00:22:01.396 --> 00:22:02.336 A:middle
you've got a server there

00:22:02.616 --> 00:22:03.506 A:middle
powering your back end.

00:22:03.846 --> 00:22:04.906 A:middle
The process here starts, of

00:22:04.906 --> 00:22:05.836 A:middle
course, with receiving that

00:22:05.836 --> 00:22:06.936 A:middle
transaction and the update

00:22:06.936 --> 00:22:08.096 A:middle
transactions call back that we

00:22:08.096 --> 00:22:08.416 A:middle
saw.

00:22:09.396 --> 00:22:10.476 A:middle
From there, you could read in

00:22:10.476 --> 00:22:12.316 A:middle
that binary receipt data using

00:22:12.316 --> 00:22:13.386 A:middle
the API mentioned.

00:22:13.716 --> 00:22:14.956 A:middle
At this point it's still encoded

00:22:14.956 --> 00:22:15.686 A:middle
so we haven't done all these

00:22:15.686 --> 00:22:16.856 A:middle
checks yet with the certificate

00:22:16.856 --> 00:22:17.216 A:middle
or anything.

00:22:17.806 --> 00:22:18.456 A:middle
Instead of doing it on the

00:22:18.456 --> 00:22:19.796 A:middle
device, what we can do is take

00:22:19.796 --> 00:22:21.346 A:middle
that binary encoded receipt data

00:22:21.716 --> 00:22:23.256 A:middle
and send it up to your server.

00:22:24.626 --> 00:22:26.096 A:middle
From here, you can just

00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:27.246 A:middle
establish connection over to the

00:22:27.246 --> 00:22:29.256 A:middle
App Store server by this verify

00:22:29.256 --> 00:22:30.396 A:middle
receipt url.

00:22:31.076 --> 00:22:32.326 A:middle
And you pass that binary data

00:22:32.326 --> 00:22:33.296 A:middle
over to the App Store.

00:22:33.296 --> 00:22:34.806 A:middle
Now the App Store does all that

00:22:34.806 --> 00:22:35.766 A:middle
hard work of checking the

00:22:35.766 --> 00:22:37.396 A:middle
certificates and verifying all

00:22:37.396 --> 00:22:38.066 A:middle
this information.

00:22:38.246 --> 00:22:40.086 A:middle
And it responds with a receipt

00:22:40.086 --> 00:22:41.426 A:middle
validity status as to whether or

00:22:41.426 --> 00:22:42.966 A:middle
not this is a valid document

00:22:42.966 --> 00:22:45.556 A:middle
that you can trust.

00:22:45.556 --> 00:22:47.176 A:middle
So this is it again really in

00:22:47.176 --> 00:22:48.576 A:middle
textual form, the response is in

00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:48.806 A:middle
JSON.

00:22:49.526 --> 00:22:51.816 A:middle
And it returns that status as to

00:22:51.816 --> 00:22:52.866 A:middle
whether a receipt is valid or

00:22:52.866 --> 00:22:54.136 A:middle
not but one point to note here,

00:22:54.136 --> 00:22:55.586 A:middle
as I mentioned before, you

00:22:55.586 --> 00:22:56.426 A:middle
shouldn't ever use this

00:22:56.426 --> 00:22:57.516 A:middle
technique directly from the

00:22:57.516 --> 00:22:58.266 A:middle
user's device.

00:22:58.616 --> 00:22:59.776 A:middle
This is really only secure when

00:22:59.776 --> 00:23:00.756 A:middle
you're doing it from your server

00:23:00.756 --> 00:23:01.386 A:middle
to the App Store.

00:23:01.976 --> 00:23:05.706 A:middle
And that's the whole step of

00:23:05.756 --> 00:23:06.926 A:middle
validating a receipt on your

00:23:06.926 --> 00:23:07.236 A:middle
server.

00:23:07.236 --> 00:23:08.806 A:middle
It's a little simpler than on

00:23:08.806 --> 00:23:09.606 A:middle
the user's device.

00:23:10.466 --> 00:23:11.696 A:middle
Now let's take a look at how you

00:23:11.696 --> 00:23:13.156 A:middle
unlock content and inspect

00:23:13.156 --> 00:23:14.986 A:middle
transactions based on this

00:23:14.986 --> 00:23:15.366 A:middle
scenario.

00:23:17.736 --> 00:23:18.826 A:middle
Let's look at this example

00:23:18.826 --> 00:23:19.096 A:middle
again.

00:23:19.096 --> 00:23:20.296 A:middle
So let's say that you've sent

00:23:20.296 --> 00:23:21.816 A:middle
that binary data up to your

00:23:22.226 --> 00:23:22.426 A:middle
server.

00:23:22.456 --> 00:23:23.746 A:middle
You establish that connection to

00:23:23.746 --> 00:23:24.976 A:middle
the App Store and you send over

00:23:24.976 --> 00:23:26.396 A:middle
the binary data to the App

00:23:26.396 --> 00:23:26.636 A:middle
Store.

00:23:27.636 --> 00:23:28.876 A:middle
Now not only does the App Store

00:23:28.876 --> 00:23:30.556 A:middle
actually respond with the

00:23:30.556 --> 00:23:32.176 A:middle
validity of the receipt, the

00:23:32.336 --> 00:23:33.836 A:middle
response here actually includes

00:23:34.106 --> 00:23:35.886 A:middle
a decoded version of the latest

00:23:36.326 --> 00:23:37.946 A:middle
application receipt as well.

00:23:38.386 --> 00:23:39.746 A:middle
So this is a decoded version in

00:23:39.746 --> 00:23:41.496 A:middle
JSON that you can inspect and

00:23:41.496 --> 00:23:42.786 A:middle
look at all those transactions.

00:23:42.786 --> 00:23:43.946 A:middle
It's just the same consent that

00:23:43.946 --> 00:23:45.546 A:middle
you see on the user's device

00:23:45.546 --> 00:23:46.396 A:middle
when you decrypt it on the

00:23:46.396 --> 00:23:48.116 A:middle
device but this time it's a JSON

00:23:48.116 --> 00:23:49.066 A:middle
payload from the App Store and

00:23:49.066 --> 00:23:49.996 A:middle
you can just inspect all those

00:23:49.996 --> 00:23:50.566 A:middle
transactions.

00:23:50.906 --> 00:23:52.056 A:middle
Make decisions about whether to

00:23:52.056 --> 00:23:53.716 A:middle
unlock the content and then go

00:23:53.716 --> 00:23:54.486 A:middle
ahead and finish that

00:23:54.486 --> 00:23:55.596 A:middle
transaction back down on the

00:23:55.596 --> 00:23:56.546 A:middle
user's device again.

00:23:57.306 --> 00:23:58.266 A:middle
This is particularly useful

00:23:58.266 --> 00:23:59.446 A:middle
because you can then do things

00:23:59.446 --> 00:24:00.746 A:middle
like updating state across other

00:24:00.746 --> 00:24:01.756 A:middle
platforms that you might have

00:24:01.756 --> 00:24:03.106 A:middle
associated with your server.

00:24:04.626 --> 00:24:05.936 A:middle
So this is what that process

00:24:05.936 --> 00:24:07.266 A:middle
looks like, again, just in text

00:24:07.266 --> 00:24:08.576 A:middle
but the important point here to

00:24:08.576 --> 00:24:09.406 A:middle
call out is that you have to

00:24:09.406 --> 00:24:10.746 A:middle
remember to tell the device to

00:24:10.746 --> 00:24:12.126 A:middle
still finish the transaction if

00:24:12.126 --> 00:24:12.976 A:middle
you're using this technique.

00:24:18.226 --> 00:24:19.256 A:middle
So let's answer this question

00:24:19.256 --> 00:24:21.426 A:middle
again of unlocking subscription

00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:21.746 A:middle
features.

00:24:21.746 --> 00:24:23.186 A:middle
So does my user have an active

00:24:23.186 --> 00:24:23.746 A:middle
subscription.

00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:25.906 A:middle
It's exactly the same flow, you

00:24:25.906 --> 00:24:26.936 A:middle
know, here because we said that

00:24:27.306 --> 00:24:28.336 A:middle
this receipt contains all the

00:24:28.336 --> 00:24:29.006 A:middle
same information.

00:24:29.006 --> 00:24:29.656 A:middle
So you can group the

00:24:29.656 --> 00:24:30.936 A:middle
transactions that come back in

00:24:30.936 --> 00:24:32.766 A:middle
this receipt by the original

00:24:32.766 --> 00:24:33.576 A:middle
transaction ID.

00:24:33.576 --> 00:24:34.936 A:middle
That's that subscription ID

00:24:34.936 --> 00:24:35.246 A:middle
field.

00:24:35.956 --> 00:24:36.976 A:middle
And all you need to do is find

00:24:36.976 --> 00:24:37.956 A:middle
the transaction that has the

00:24:37.956 --> 00:24:39.126 A:middle
latest expiry date.

00:24:39.126 --> 00:24:40.386 A:middle
And if there's an expiry date in

00:24:40.386 --> 00:24:41.876 A:middle
the future that's an indication

00:24:41.876 --> 00:24:43.476 A:middle
that the user is in an active

00:24:43.476 --> 00:24:44.086 A:middle
subscription.

00:24:45.156 --> 00:24:46.166 A:middle
If there's not an expiry date in

00:24:46.166 --> 00:24:47.176 A:middle
the future, if it's in the past

00:24:47.176 --> 00:24:48.836 A:middle
somewhere well that means that

00:24:48.896 --> 00:24:50.156 A:middle
the subscription's unfortunately

00:24:50.156 --> 00:24:50.576 A:middle
lapsed.

00:24:50.956 --> 00:24:52.126 A:middle
And this is the latest copy of

00:24:52.126 --> 00:24:52.586 A:middle
the receipt.

00:24:52.586 --> 00:24:53.386 A:middle
So there's no way that you can

00:24:53.386 --> 00:24:55.166 A:middle
really do a receipt refresh

00:24:55.166 --> 00:24:55.846 A:middle
request from the server.

00:24:55.846 --> 00:24:56.976 A:middle
You've just got the latest copy

00:24:56.976 --> 00:24:57.286 A:middle
already.

00:24:57.926 --> 00:25:01.086 A:middle
So now we've unlocked content on

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:02.346 A:middle
the server based on this

00:25:02.346 --> 00:25:02.926 A:middle
information.

00:25:03.166 --> 00:25:04.076 A:middle
As I mentioned, you still need

00:25:04.076 --> 00:25:04.876 A:middle
to remember to finish the

00:25:04.876 --> 00:25:06.036 A:middle
transaction back down on the

00:25:06.036 --> 00:25:06.976 A:middle
user's device again.

00:25:07.446 --> 00:25:08.546 A:middle
You'll hear me say finish

00:25:08.546 --> 00:25:09.736 A:middle
transactions a lot in this talk.

00:25:09.736 --> 00:25:11.336 A:middle
It's a really important point

00:25:11.336 --> 00:25:13.726 A:middle
that I want to drive home today.

00:25:13.936 --> 00:25:15.486 A:middle
So let's look specifically at

00:25:15.486 --> 00:25:16.486 A:middle
subscriptions for a little

00:25:16.486 --> 00:25:16.746 A:middle
while.

00:25:16.746 --> 00:25:18.686 A:middle
These scenarios have applied to

00:25:18.686 --> 00:25:19.796 A:middle
all in-app purchase types.

00:25:20.036 --> 00:25:21.136 A:middle
Now let's really talk about

00:25:21.416 --> 00:25:22.426 A:middle
maintaining subscription state

00:25:22.426 --> 00:25:24.026 A:middle
and particularly using that

00:25:24.026 --> 00:25:24.826 A:middle
service side flow.

00:25:24.826 --> 00:25:29.686 A:middle
So in this example, again, we

00:25:29.686 --> 00:25:30.896 A:middle
have an updated transactions

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:32.706 A:middle
call being given to the user's

00:25:32.706 --> 00:25:33.266 A:middle
device.

00:25:33.486 --> 00:25:34.446 A:middle
And the user can read in that

00:25:34.446 --> 00:25:36.626 A:middle
binary receipt data into memory

00:25:36.626 --> 00:25:37.356 A:middle
on the user's device.

00:25:37.356 --> 00:25:39.526 A:middle
They send that information up to

00:25:39.606 --> 00:25:40.946 A:middle
your server.

00:25:41.126 --> 00:25:42.326 A:middle
Now this time, we're going to do

00:25:42.326 --> 00:25:43.066 A:middle
a little bit of a different

00:25:43.066 --> 00:25:43.436 A:middle
technique.

00:25:43.436 --> 00:25:44.396 A:middle
This is going to be a bit more

00:25:44.396 --> 00:25:45.466 A:middle
of a real world scenario here.

00:25:45.896 --> 00:25:47.316 A:middle
We're going to hold onto a copy

00:25:47.626 --> 00:25:49.316 A:middle
of the binary receipt data on

00:25:49.316 --> 00:25:51.346 A:middle
your server here and at the same

00:25:51.346 --> 00:25:52.516 A:middle
time, we'll send a copy of that

00:25:52.516 --> 00:25:53.746 A:middle
data over to the App Store to

00:25:53.746 --> 00:25:54.976 A:middle
achieve the technique that we

00:25:54.976 --> 00:25:55.556 A:middle
saw before.

00:25:55.556 --> 00:25:56.956 A:middle
So this will respond with the

00:25:56.956 --> 00:25:58.056 A:middle
latest copy of the receipt and

00:25:58.056 --> 00:25:59.506 A:middle
we can do that same technique of

00:25:59.896 --> 00:26:01.236 A:middle
finishing a transaction and

00:26:01.236 --> 00:26:02.806 A:middle
updating content across devices.

00:26:03.116 --> 00:26:06.016 A:middle
Now in this example, we're

00:26:06.016 --> 00:26:06.916 A:middle
dealing with an auto renewable

00:26:06.916 --> 00:26:07.586 A:middle
subscription.

00:26:07.656 --> 00:26:09.316 A:middle
So let's say that the user goes

00:26:09.396 --> 00:26:10.506 A:middle
offline for a bit and stops

00:26:10.506 --> 00:26:11.666 A:middle
using your app for a few days

00:26:12.086 --> 00:26:13.576 A:middle
which is a shocking thought, I

00:26:13.576 --> 00:26:13.706 A:middle
know.

00:26:14.006 --> 00:26:16.176 A:middle
But it can happen and if it does

00:26:16.176 --> 00:26:18.346 A:middle
happen and then the user happens

00:26:18.376 --> 00:26:19.306 A:middle
to have their subscription

00:26:19.306 --> 00:26:20.376 A:middle
renewed in the background during

00:26:20.376 --> 00:26:21.046 A:middle
this process.

00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:22.226 A:middle
The credit card's charged.

00:26:22.796 --> 00:26:24.116 A:middle
So a new transaction's taken

00:26:24.116 --> 00:26:24.746 A:middle
place somewhere.

00:26:25.726 --> 00:26:26.666 A:middle
And you don't know about it yet.

00:26:26.666 --> 00:26:28.076 A:middle
So the user jumps on, I don't

00:26:28.076 --> 00:26:28.736 A:middle
know your website.

00:26:30.126 --> 00:26:31.386 A:middle
And at this point, your server

00:26:31.386 --> 00:26:32.706 A:middle
doesn't have any new information

00:26:32.706 --> 00:26:33.736 A:middle
about the transaction that's

00:26:33.736 --> 00:26:35.336 A:middle
taken place in the background.

00:26:35.946 --> 00:26:36.986 A:middle
So in order for you to know this

00:26:36.986 --> 00:26:38.266 A:middle
information from your service

00:26:38.266 --> 00:26:40.136 A:middle
point of view, remember we're

00:26:40.136 --> 00:26:41.236 A:middle
holding on to that binary

00:26:41.236 --> 00:26:42.446 A:middle
receipt data on the server.

00:26:42.446 --> 00:26:43.806 A:middle
You can treat that data just

00:26:43.806 --> 00:26:44.306 A:middle
like a token.

00:26:44.306 --> 00:26:45.456 A:middle
And you can actually send it

00:26:45.456 --> 00:26:46.696 A:middle
back over to the App Store here

00:26:46.986 --> 00:26:47.996 A:middle
by that same request.

00:26:48.486 --> 00:26:50.846 A:middle
And as I mentioned before, not

00:26:50.846 --> 00:26:52.096 A:middle
only does this include the

00:26:52.096 --> 00:26:53.386 A:middle
decoded receipt data, this is

00:26:53.386 --> 00:26:55.046 A:middle
actually the latest copy of the

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:55.976 A:middle
application receipt.

00:26:56.226 --> 00:26:57.746 A:middle
So this is latest copy is going

00:26:57.746 --> 00:26:59.246 A:middle
to contain any new transactions

00:26:59.246 --> 00:27:00.206 A:middle
that have occurred in the

00:27:00.206 --> 00:27:00.736 A:middle
background.

00:27:00.736 --> 00:27:02.406 A:middle
So you can find out about that

00:27:02.406 --> 00:27:03.456 A:middle
transaction that's occurred and

00:27:03.786 --> 00:27:05.276 A:middle
accordingly, give the user

00:27:05.276 --> 00:27:06.556 A:middle
access to your website again.

00:27:07.696 --> 00:27:08.486 A:middle
From there, you might want to

00:27:08.486 --> 00:27:09.696 A:middle
unlock content across multiple

00:27:09.696 --> 00:27:10.276 A:middle
devices.

00:27:11.026 --> 00:27:12.096 A:middle
But you do have to remember that

00:27:12.096 --> 00:27:13.296 A:middle
when the user does pick up that

00:27:13.296 --> 00:27:14.796 A:middle
original device again and come

00:27:14.796 --> 00:27:16.756 A:middle
back online, that will still

00:27:16.756 --> 00:27:17.956 A:middle
receive the transaction through

00:27:17.956 --> 00:27:19.276 A:middle
the updated transactions call.

00:27:19.276 --> 00:27:21.186 A:middle
And so you still need to handle

00:27:21.186 --> 00:27:22.396 A:middle
this and all the way through to

00:27:22.396 --> 00:27:23.336 A:middle
finishing the transaction.

00:27:23.336 --> 00:27:24.896 A:middle
So what we'd suggest is maybe

00:27:25.096 --> 00:27:26.236 A:middle
treat this as an opportunity to

00:27:26.566 --> 00:27:27.986 A:middle
update that binary receipt data

00:27:27.986 --> 00:27:28.716 A:middle
up on your server.

00:27:28.716 --> 00:27:30.906 A:middle
You're probably associating that

00:27:30.906 --> 00:27:32.466 A:middle
with a user's account for your

00:27:32.466 --> 00:27:33.366 A:middle
particular application.

00:27:33.816 --> 00:27:35.186 A:middle
And then remember to finish the

00:27:35.186 --> 00:27:36.226 A:middle
transaction back down on the

00:27:36.226 --> 00:27:36.826 A:middle
device again.

00:27:36.826 --> 00:27:37.716 A:middle
So even though your server

00:27:37.716 --> 00:27:38.596 A:middle
already knew about this

00:27:38.596 --> 00:27:39.546 A:middle
transaction, it's still

00:27:39.546 --> 00:27:40.966 A:middle
important to complete this flow

00:27:40.966 --> 00:27:41.996 A:middle
and finish that transaction

00:27:41.996 --> 00:27:42.996 A:middle
based on what I said before.

00:27:44.056 --> 00:27:45.316 A:middle
So for this technique, what

00:27:45.346 --> 00:27:46.396 A:middle
we're really doing here is we're

00:27:46.396 --> 00:27:48.106 A:middle
treating that receipt data much

00:27:48.106 --> 00:27:48.646 A:middle
like a token.

00:27:48.736 --> 00:27:49.826 A:middle
And we're using it to perform

00:27:50.026 --> 00:27:51.516 A:middle
multiple requests by storing it

00:27:51.796 --> 00:27:52.406 A:middle
on your server.

00:27:53.046 --> 00:27:54.156 A:middle
It's the same binary data that

00:27:54.156 --> 00:27:55.726 A:middle
can be used over and over again.

00:27:56.336 --> 00:27:58.296 A:middle
And it's quite useful for

00:27:58.296 --> 00:27:59.596 A:middle
propagating subscription state

00:27:59.596 --> 00:28:00.906 A:middle
across multiple devices and

00:28:00.906 --> 00:28:02.766 A:middle
platforms but still remember

00:28:02.896 --> 00:28:04.786 A:middle
that you have to process all the

00:28:04.786 --> 00:28:06.106 A:middle
updated transaction calls and

00:28:06.106 --> 00:28:07.166 A:middle
that means all the renewal

00:28:07.166 --> 00:28:08.566 A:middle
transactions that come through

00:28:08.826 --> 00:28:10.306 A:middle
for each billing period all the

00:28:10.306 --> 00:28:11.886 A:middle
way through to finishing the

00:28:11.886 --> 00:28:12.436 A:middle
transaction.

00:28:12.436 --> 00:28:16.716 A:middle
Now, as you can imagine, over

00:28:16.716 --> 00:28:18.096 A:middle
time if you're dealing with an

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:19.156 A:middle
auto renewable subscription

00:28:19.156 --> 00:28:20.826 A:middle
particularly if it has a short

00:28:20.826 --> 00:28:22.776 A:middle
billing period, this transaction

00:28:22.776 --> 00:28:24.236 A:middle
receipt can grow quite large,

00:28:24.236 --> 00:28:24.456 A:middle
you know?

00:28:24.456 --> 00:28:26.236 A:middle
Every transaction that occurs

00:28:26.236 --> 00:28:27.266 A:middle
for a subscription appears on

00:28:27.266 --> 00:28:27.686 A:middle
the receipt.

00:28:27.776 --> 00:28:29.506 A:middle
So this document can grow quite

00:28:29.506 --> 00:28:30.446 A:middle
large over time.

00:28:31.186 --> 00:28:32.816 A:middle
And we've heard feedback that a

00:28:32.816 --> 00:28:34.086 A:middle
lot of you only real care about

00:28:34.336 --> 00:28:35.296 A:middle
the latest transaction.

00:28:35.376 --> 00:28:36.486 A:middle
You know I keep on saying you

00:28:36.486 --> 00:28:37.606 A:middle
check for the latest expiry

00:28:37.606 --> 00:28:37.736 A:middle
date.

00:28:37.736 --> 00:28:38.716 A:middle
Well a lot of you really only

00:28:38.716 --> 00:28:39.616 A:middle
care about that particular

00:28:39.616 --> 00:28:40.166 A:middle
transaction.

00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:42.526 A:middle
So we're enhancing this endpoint

00:28:42.526 --> 00:28:44.136 A:middle
today with a new query parameter

00:28:44.136 --> 00:28:45.456 A:middle
that you can include which is to

00:28:45.456 --> 00:28:47.416 A:middle
exclude old transactions from

00:28:47.416 --> 00:28:48.136 A:middle
this endpoint.

00:28:48.646 --> 00:28:50.506 A:middle
If you set this to true, the

00:28:51.486 --> 00:28:52.786 A:middle
verify receipt endpoint's just

00:28:52.786 --> 00:28:54.636 A:middle
going to respond with the latest

00:28:54.636 --> 00:28:55.766 A:middle
transaction for each

00:28:55.766 --> 00:28:56.406 A:middle
subscription.

00:28:56.496 --> 00:28:57.396 A:middle
So that's going to drastically

00:28:57.396 --> 00:28:58.906 A:middle
reduce the payload of that

00:28:58.906 --> 00:29:00.376 A:middle
request that's coming back from

00:29:00.376 --> 00:29:01.566 A:middle
the verified receipt endpoint.

00:29:01.986 --> 00:29:03.756 A:middle
And not only just save web

00:29:03.756 --> 00:29:04.806 A:middle
traffic but it's also just going

00:29:04.806 --> 00:29:07.096 A:middle
to mean saved processing time on

00:29:07.096 --> 00:29:08.086 A:middle
your server because you don't

00:29:08.086 --> 00:29:09.426 A:middle
have as many transactions to be

00:29:09.426 --> 00:29:09.886 A:middle
looping through.

00:29:09.886 --> 00:29:11.066 A:middle
Now this doesn't sound like a

00:29:11.066 --> 00:29:12.066 A:middle
lot but when you're dealing with

00:29:12.206 --> 00:29:13.896 A:middle
thousands or millions of users

00:29:13.896 --> 00:29:15.486 A:middle
like a lot of you do, this can

00:29:15.486 --> 00:29:16.386 A:middle
actually save quite a lot of

00:29:16.386 --> 00:29:16.606 A:middle
time.

00:29:16.606 --> 00:29:17.456 A:middle
So we think this is going to be

00:29:17.456 --> 00:29:18.546 A:middle
a great enhancement for those of

00:29:18.546 --> 00:29:19.536 A:middle
you're dealing with this

00:29:19.536 --> 00:29:20.316 A:middle
particular scenario.

00:29:21.006 --> 00:29:23.706 A:middle
Now this technique of status

00:29:23.706 --> 00:29:23.976 A:middle
polling --

00:29:24.516 --> 00:29:27.606 A:middle
[ Clapping ]

00:29:28.106 --> 00:29:30.686 A:middle
Thanks. This technique of status

00:29:30.686 --> 00:29:32.166 A:middle
polling really fits as a bit of

00:29:32.166 --> 00:29:33.066 A:middle
a server side tool.

00:29:33.066 --> 00:29:33.956 A:middle
So you can think about it as

00:29:33.956 --> 00:29:34.706 A:middle
sitting up here in this

00:29:34.706 --> 00:29:36.616 A:middle
particular diagram but you'll

00:29:36.616 --> 00:29:37.846 A:middle
notice I'm leaving that

00:29:37.846 --> 00:29:39.456 A:middle
particular flow of updating and

00:29:39.456 --> 00:29:40.586 A:middle
finishing transactions because

00:29:40.586 --> 00:29:41.656 A:middle
it's still important that you

00:29:41.656 --> 00:29:43.206 A:middle
handle all of these transactions

00:29:43.206 --> 00:29:43.856 A:middle
as you come through in a user's

00:29:43.856 --> 00:29:44.000 A:middle
device.

00:29:47.976 --> 00:29:49.596 A:middle
So let's stick on the subject of

00:29:49.596 --> 00:29:50.926 A:middle
subscriptions for a little bit.

00:29:57.416 --> 00:29:58.556 A:middle
Now we opened up auto renewable

00:29:58.556 --> 00:30:00.026 A:middle
subscriptions to many more

00:30:00.026 --> 00:30:01.176 A:middle
categories last year.

00:30:01.356 --> 00:30:02.526 A:middle
And we've seen great uptake and

00:30:02.526 --> 00:30:03.816 A:middle
heard great feedback from those

00:30:03.816 --> 00:30:04.766 A:middle
of you who have implemented

00:30:04.766 --> 00:30:04.896 A:middle
them.

00:30:05.636 --> 00:30:06.816 A:middle
And we've tried to offer

00:30:07.126 --> 00:30:08.716 A:middle
information about your users and

00:30:08.716 --> 00:30:09.806 A:middle
the behavior of them via the way

00:30:09.806 --> 00:30:11.116 A:middle
of things like iTunes Connect

00:30:11.116 --> 00:30:11.616 A:middle
reports.

00:30:12.026 --> 00:30:13.446 A:middle
You can find about how many

00:30:13.446 --> 00:30:14.816 A:middle
expirys you had and some of the

00:30:14.816 --> 00:30:15.816 A:middle
reasoning behind that but

00:30:16.256 --> 00:30:17.216 A:middle
there's been a lot of questions

00:30:17.216 --> 00:30:18.086 A:middle
that you've had that you haven't

00:30:18.086 --> 00:30:19.246 A:middle
been able to answer until now.

00:30:19.956 --> 00:30:21.066 A:middle
Particularly about individual

00:30:21.066 --> 00:30:21.326 A:middle
users.

00:30:21.326 --> 00:30:22.556 A:middle
So what are these questions?

00:30:22.556 --> 00:30:24.176 A:middle
Things like why did a particular

00:30:24.176 --> 00:30:25.416 A:middle
user's subscription expire?

00:30:25.416 --> 00:30:27.806 A:middle
Or will this user's subscription

00:30:27.806 --> 00:30:29.106 A:middle
be renewed as the end of this

00:30:29.136 --> 00:30:29.746 A:middle
billing period?

00:30:31.176 --> 00:30:32.816 A:middle
Will this user be downgraded at

00:30:32.816 --> 00:30:33.696 A:middle
the end of this billing period?

00:30:33.696 --> 00:30:35.346 A:middle
Have they elected to change that

00:30:35.346 --> 00:30:36.526 A:middle
subscription that they're

00:30:36.526 --> 00:30:38.216 A:middle
subscribed to?

00:30:38.386 --> 00:30:39.486 A:middle
Maybe they asked for a refund

00:30:39.486 --> 00:30:40.166 A:middle
from AppleCare?

00:30:40.226 --> 00:30:41.346 A:middle
What was the reason behind it?

00:30:41.466 --> 00:30:42.706 A:middle
Did they have a problem or is

00:30:42.766 --> 00:30:43.816 A:middle
just something that they wanted

00:30:43.816 --> 00:30:44.096 A:middle
to do?

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:46.186 A:middle
Have they agreed to a price

00:30:46.186 --> 00:30:47.456 A:middle
increase that I've put in place?

00:30:47.486 --> 00:30:49.386 A:middle
Or will they just end their

00:30:49.386 --> 00:30:50.356 A:middle
subscription at the end of this

00:30:50.396 --> 00:30:50.856 A:middle
billing period?

00:30:50.856 --> 00:30:51.746 A:middle
How can I know this ahead of

00:30:51.796 --> 00:30:52.066 A:middle
time?

00:30:52.446 --> 00:30:53.876 A:middle
Or just simply what kind of

00:30:53.876 --> 00:30:55.506 A:middle
messaging do I need to tell my

00:30:55.506 --> 00:30:56.616 A:middle
user about their subscription?

00:30:56.616 --> 00:30:58.076 A:middle
How can I communicate to them

00:30:58.076 --> 00:31:00.446 A:middle
effectively and you know, with

00:31:00.446 --> 00:31:01.096 A:middle
things they need to know?

00:31:01.546 --> 00:31:02.856 A:middle
Now why are all these questions

00:31:02.856 --> 00:31:03.516 A:middle
really important?

00:31:04.906 --> 00:31:06.356 A:middle
Obviously to provide a great

00:31:06.356 --> 00:31:07.716 A:middle
experience for the user but can

00:31:07.716 --> 00:31:09.126 A:middle
you think about why these

00:31:09.126 --> 00:31:10.276 A:middle
questions are really important?

00:31:10.276 --> 00:31:13.496 A:middle
Well, it's because all these

00:31:14.376 --> 00:31:16.246 A:middle
questions are centered around

00:31:16.316 --> 00:31:17.726 A:middle
the user's renewal of their

00:31:17.726 --> 00:31:19.386 A:middle
subscription and so providing a

00:31:19.386 --> 00:31:21.026 A:middle
seamless experience in these

00:31:21.026 --> 00:31:22.456 A:middle
particularly scenarios, it's

00:31:22.536 --> 00:31:24.186 A:middle
really paramount to reducing

00:31:24.186 --> 00:31:25.506 A:middle
what we call subscription churn.

00:31:26.406 --> 00:31:27.316 A:middle
Subscription churn is just a

00:31:27.316 --> 00:31:28.306 A:middle
fancy way of saying losing

00:31:28.306 --> 00:31:28.946 A:middle
subscribers.

00:31:29.256 --> 00:31:30.126 A:middle
And the thing is when you lose

00:31:30.126 --> 00:31:32.106 A:middle
subscribers that's immediately

00:31:32.106 --> 00:31:33.446 A:middle
lost revenue for your business.

00:31:33.586 --> 00:31:34.816 A:middle
And not only is it lost revenue

00:31:34.816 --> 00:31:35.986 A:middle
for your business it's a lost

00:31:35.986 --> 00:31:37.626 A:middle
acquisition cost for each one of

00:31:37.626 --> 00:31:38.466 A:middle
those users as well.

00:31:39.926 --> 00:31:40.686 A:middle
Now we can think about

00:31:40.686 --> 00:31:42.566 A:middle
subscription churn as two

00:31:42.566 --> 00:31:43.316 A:middle
particular buckets.

00:31:43.316 --> 00:31:43.996 A:middle
We can talk about the

00:31:43.996 --> 00:31:46.056 A:middle
involuntary churn, which is the

00:31:46.056 --> 00:31:47.506 A:middle
case that the user hasn't even

00:31:47.506 --> 00:31:48.816 A:middle
elected to unsubscribe.

00:31:48.816 --> 00:31:49.826 A:middle
Maybe their credit card just

00:31:49.826 --> 00:31:51.026 A:middle
expired and it was an

00:31:51.026 --> 00:31:52.026 A:middle
involuntary action.

00:31:52.776 --> 00:31:55.216 A:middle
Now this is far too many users

00:31:55.216 --> 00:31:56.026 A:middle
fall into this particular

00:31:56.026 --> 00:31:56.406 A:middle
category.

00:31:57.516 --> 00:31:58.596 A:middle
There's also voluntary

00:31:58.596 --> 00:31:59.326 A:middle
subscription churn.

00:31:59.326 --> 00:32:00.466 A:middle
In the case that a user elected

00:32:00.466 --> 00:32:01.956 A:middle
to unsubscribe from your

00:32:01.956 --> 00:32:02.516 A:middle
application.

00:32:02.906 --> 00:32:04.356 A:middle
Maybe they asked for a refund

00:32:04.356 --> 00:32:05.436 A:middle
from AppleCare or they turned

00:32:05.436 --> 00:32:06.826 A:middle
off auto renew inside the

00:32:06.826 --> 00:32:07.346 A:middle
settings.

00:32:08.786 --> 00:32:10.156 A:middle
So we really want to empower you

00:32:10.156 --> 00:32:11.376 A:middle
with new tools to be able to

00:32:11.376 --> 00:32:12.406 A:middle
address both of these buckets

00:32:12.406 --> 00:32:13.096 A:middle
and we think we've got some

00:32:13.096 --> 00:32:14.366 A:middle
great new ways to do that today.

00:32:14.366 --> 00:32:15.306 A:middle
So we're announcing some new

00:32:15.306 --> 00:32:16.896 A:middle
tools to help reduce this

00:32:16.896 --> 00:32:17.566 A:middle
subscription churn.

00:32:18.296 --> 00:32:19.376 A:middle
Now to go through them, let's

00:32:19.376 --> 00:32:20.396 A:middle
walk through an example, again,

00:32:20.396 --> 00:32:21.116 A:middle
just to illustrate it.

00:32:22.456 --> 00:32:23.536 A:middle
So let's say a user here is

00:32:23.536 --> 00:32:24.926 A:middle
subscribed to your subscription

00:32:24.926 --> 00:32:25.416 A:middle
service.

00:32:25.416 --> 00:32:26.386 A:middle
It's a video subscription

00:32:26.386 --> 00:32:27.356 A:middle
service for this example.

00:32:28.096 --> 00:32:29.446 A:middle
You're using these techniques

00:32:29.446 --> 00:32:30.666 A:middle
with status polling like we said

00:32:30.666 --> 00:32:32.376 A:middle
before to poll the App Store to

00:32:32.376 --> 00:32:34.306 A:middle
find out the latest subscription

00:32:34.436 --> 00:32:35.656 A:middle
information about a user and

00:32:35.756 --> 00:32:36.876 A:middle
they're actively subscribed.

00:32:37.126 --> 00:32:37.676 A:middle
Everyone's happy.

00:32:38.716 --> 00:32:40.086 A:middle
Then the user goes offline for a

00:32:40.086 --> 00:32:40.616 A:middle
few days.

00:32:41.976 --> 00:32:43.266 A:middle
And during this particular time,

00:32:43.716 --> 00:32:44.706 A:middle
their subscription's renewed

00:32:44.706 --> 00:32:44.916 A:middle
again.

00:32:44.916 --> 00:32:45.926 A:middle
This is a similar example to

00:32:45.926 --> 00:32:47.976 A:middle
before, but, this time let's say

00:32:47.976 --> 00:32:48.976 A:middle
that the user's credit card's

00:32:48.976 --> 00:32:49.516 A:middle
expired.

00:32:49.516 --> 00:32:50.806 A:middle
And the App Store wasn't able to

00:32:50.806 --> 00:32:51.266 A:middle
charge them.

00:32:51.916 --> 00:32:53.146 A:middle
So there was some kind of

00:32:53.146 --> 00:32:54.086 A:middle
billing error that's happened

00:32:54.506 --> 00:32:55.846 A:middle
and the user comes along and

00:32:55.846 --> 00:32:58.126 A:middle
jumps on your website in order

00:32:58.126 --> 00:32:59.146 A:middle
to keep on watching videos.

00:32:59.606 --> 00:33:00.526 A:middle
Now at this point your server

00:33:00.526 --> 00:33:01.556 A:middle
does that status polling

00:33:01.556 --> 00:33:02.706 A:middle
technique that we talked about

00:33:03.476 --> 00:33:05.206 A:middle
but the App Store's going to

00:33:05.206 --> 00:33:06.156 A:middle
inform it that there's been no

00:33:06.156 --> 00:33:07.116 A:middle
transaction that's occurred

00:33:07.116 --> 00:33:08.316 A:middle
because there was a billing

00:33:08.316 --> 00:33:08.786 A:middle
error, right?

00:33:08.786 --> 00:33:10.136 A:middle
So your server does the only

00:33:10.136 --> 00:33:10.716 A:middle
thing that it can.

00:33:10.716 --> 00:33:12.096 A:middle
It informs the website that

00:33:12.476 --> 00:33:13.706 A:middle
subscription's actually expired

00:33:13.746 --> 00:33:15.436 A:middle
and the user, the poor user's

00:33:15.436 --> 00:33:16.126 A:middle
done nothing wrong.

00:33:16.126 --> 00:33:17.276 A:middle
Their credit card just expired.

00:33:17.676 --> 00:33:19.096 A:middle
They go over and begrudgingly

00:33:19.096 --> 00:33:20.116 A:middle
pull out their credit card.

00:33:20.276 --> 00:33:21.366 A:middle
They go and update their credit

00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:22.646 A:middle
card details in the App Store.

00:33:23.126 --> 00:33:24.446 A:middle
The App Store based on the new

00:33:24.446 --> 00:33:25.336 A:middle
credit card details is

00:33:25.336 --> 00:33:26.616 A:middle
successfully able to actually

00:33:26.616 --> 00:33:27.406 A:middle
charge that card.

00:33:27.766 --> 00:33:28.636 A:middle
So the user's gone to this

00:33:28.636 --> 00:33:30.096 A:middle
effort, everything looks good.

00:33:30.096 --> 00:33:31.256 A:middle
They jump back on your website

00:33:31.626 --> 00:33:32.066 A:middle
and then bah.

00:33:33.126 --> 00:33:33.596 A:middle
This happens.

00:33:34.896 --> 00:33:36.586 A:middle
Now at this point, your server

00:33:36.716 --> 00:33:38.576 A:middle
had no knowledge of the actual

00:33:38.606 --> 00:33:39.676 A:middle
transaction that's occurred.

00:33:39.876 --> 00:33:40.916 A:middle
The fact that that credit card

00:33:40.916 --> 00:33:42.436 A:middle
was able to be charged again and

00:33:42.436 --> 00:33:43.616 A:middle
so if this kind of thing happens

00:33:43.616 --> 00:33:45.616 A:middle
to you as a user, go to all that

00:33:45.616 --> 00:33:45.946 A:middle
effort.

00:33:45.946 --> 00:33:46.796 A:middle
You update your credit card

00:33:46.796 --> 00:33:48.406 A:middle
details and then you even see

00:33:48.406 --> 00:33:49.546 A:middle
money being taken off your

00:33:49.546 --> 00:33:51.296 A:middle
credit card and then you don't

00:33:51.296 --> 00:33:52.356 A:middle
get an immediate update of your

00:33:52.356 --> 00:33:54.316 A:middle
subscription state, you probably

00:33:54.316 --> 00:33:56.476 A:middle
just unsubscribe or you ask for

00:33:56.476 --> 00:33:57.316 A:middle
a refund straight away.

00:33:57.316 --> 00:33:58.466 A:middle
Now this happens far too

00:33:58.466 --> 00:33:58.976 A:middle
frequently.

00:33:59.386 --> 00:34:00.736 A:middle
So to address that today we're

00:34:00.736 --> 00:34:02.406 A:middle
introducing new server-to-server

00:34:02.546 --> 00:34:03.856 A:middle
notifications from the App

00:34:03.856 --> 00:34:03.976 A:middle
Store.

00:34:04.516 --> 00:34:09.576 A:middle
[ Clapping ]

00:34:10.076 --> 00:34:10.966 A:middle
So let's look at how that

00:34:10.966 --> 00:34:12.366 A:middle
scenario plays out now.

00:34:13.286 --> 00:34:14.296 A:middle
The user receives this

00:34:14.296 --> 00:34:15.246 A:middle
information that's something

00:34:15.246 --> 00:34:15.496 A:middle
happened.

00:34:15.496 --> 00:34:16.276 A:middle
There's been a billing error.

00:34:17.006 --> 00:34:18.226 A:middle
They go over and they update

00:34:18.226 --> 00:34:19.366 A:middle
their credit card details.

00:34:19.526 --> 00:34:20.966 A:middle
Now this time with the new

00:34:20.966 --> 00:34:22.046 A:middle
notifications, as soon as the

00:34:22.046 --> 00:34:23.416 A:middle
App Store is able to charge that

00:34:23.416 --> 00:34:25.076 A:middle
credit card it sends a

00:34:25.076 --> 00:34:26.526 A:middle
notification over to your server

00:34:26.826 --> 00:34:27.916 A:middle
with the latest transaction

00:34:27.916 --> 00:34:28.196 A:middle
that's occurred.

00:34:28.196 --> 00:34:29.876 A:middle
And you can use the payload of

00:34:29.876 --> 00:34:31.306 A:middle
that transaction to unblock the

00:34:31.306 --> 00:34:32.896 A:middle
user immediately and give them

00:34:32.896 --> 00:34:34.226 A:middle
access to using that website and

00:34:34.226 --> 00:34:35.196 A:middle
you've got happy users.

00:34:35.356 --> 00:34:35.786 A:middle
That's great.

00:34:36.456 --> 00:34:37.986 A:middle
So this is going to be awesome

00:34:37.986 --> 00:34:39.056 A:middle
for those of you who are dealing

00:34:39.056 --> 00:34:40.416 A:middle
with subscriptions on the server

00:34:40.416 --> 00:34:40.766 A:middle
side.

00:34:41.156 --> 00:34:41.946 A:middle
This is what it looks like in

00:34:41.946 --> 00:34:42.366 A:middle
practice.

00:34:42.366 --> 00:34:43.556 A:middle
You've got a status url in

00:34:43.666 --> 00:34:45.276 A:middle
iTunes Connect that you can

00:34:45.276 --> 00:34:45.436 A:middle
enter.

00:34:45.436 --> 00:34:47.126 A:middle
That you can put url in for your

00:34:47.126 --> 00:34:47.406 A:middle
own server.

00:34:47.406 --> 00:34:49.656 A:middle
Your server does have to adhere

00:34:49.656 --> 00:34:51.066 A:middle
the app transport security

00:34:51.066 --> 00:34:53.926 A:middle
requirements but if it does, all

00:34:53.926 --> 00:34:56.196 A:middle
it is an http post that gets

00:34:56.196 --> 00:34:57.276 A:middle
sent to your server for key

00:34:57.506 --> 00:34:58.466 A:middle
status changes for

00:34:58.466 --> 00:34:59.016 A:middle
subscriptions.

00:34:59.016 --> 00:35:00.246 A:middle
Now what are these events that

00:35:00.246 --> 00:35:01.006 A:middle
we send them for.

00:35:01.126 --> 00:35:02.656 A:middle
It happens for any initial

00:35:02.656 --> 00:35:03.826 A:middle
purchase of a subscription.

00:35:05.536 --> 00:35:06.676 A:middle
If there's any subscription

00:35:06.676 --> 00:35:07.986 A:middle
cancellations by AppleCare.

00:35:07.986 --> 00:35:09.466 A:middle
So if a user gets a refund, you

00:35:09.466 --> 00:35:10.316 A:middle
get notified of that.

00:35:11.216 --> 00:35:12.436 A:middle
It happens for any subscription

00:35:12.436 --> 00:35:13.036 A:middle
downgrades.

00:35:13.036 --> 00:35:14.216 A:middle
So any time a user elects to

00:35:14.216 --> 00:35:15.366 A:middle
downgrade their subscription,

00:35:15.366 --> 00:35:16.836 A:middle
you can find out about that and

00:35:16.836 --> 00:35:18.086 A:middle
update their subscription state

00:35:18.276 --> 00:35:19.276 A:middle
on the server accordingly.

00:35:20.366 --> 00:35:21.596 A:middle
And also that example that we

00:35:21.596 --> 00:35:22.336 A:middle
just saw, when there's a

00:35:22.376 --> 00:35:23.896 A:middle
successful renewal or a

00:35:23.896 --> 00:35:25.166 A:middle
re-purchase for an expired

00:35:25.166 --> 00:35:26.086 A:middle
subscription so that you can

00:35:26.126 --> 00:35:27.576 A:middle
unblock those users immediately

00:35:27.846 --> 00:35:28.836 A:middle
and give them access to their

00:35:28.836 --> 00:35:29.346 A:middle
subscription.

00:35:29.346 --> 00:35:31.636 A:middle
Now the payload of the

00:35:31.636 --> 00:35:32.956 A:middle
notification includes the latest

00:35:32.956 --> 00:35:34.476 A:middle
transaction for the actual

00:35:35.486 --> 00:35:36.756 A:middle
transaction in question that's

00:35:36.756 --> 00:35:37.716 A:middle
taken place that you've missed

00:35:37.716 --> 00:35:37.996 A:middle
out on.

00:35:39.016 --> 00:35:39.846 A:middle
So when you're doing this it

00:35:39.846 --> 00:35:40.636 A:middle
means that you don't need to

00:35:40.636 --> 00:35:42.296 A:middle
polling the verify receipt

00:35:42.436 --> 00:35:43.726 A:middle
nearly as often as you used to.

00:35:44.676 --> 00:35:45.946 A:middle
You still might need to call

00:35:45.946 --> 00:35:47.076 A:middle
verify receipt using that

00:35:47.076 --> 00:35:48.396 A:middle
polling but you can be a bit

00:35:48.396 --> 00:35:49.696 A:middle
smarter about when you do it.

00:35:50.356 --> 00:35:51.796 A:middle
Maybe an App Store notification

00:35:51.796 --> 00:35:52.826 A:middle
wasn't able to reach your

00:35:52.826 --> 00:35:53.126 A:middle
server.

00:35:53.666 --> 00:35:54.736 A:middle
So you still need to maybe use

00:35:54.736 --> 00:35:55.906 A:middle
this to actually retrieve and

00:35:55.946 --> 00:35:57.256 A:middle
poll information about the

00:35:57.256 --> 00:35:58.876 A:middle
subscription state but as I

00:35:58.876 --> 00:35:59.866 A:middle
said, you can a bit smarter

00:35:59.866 --> 00:36:00.536 A:middle
about when you do it.

00:36:00.536 --> 00:36:01.806 A:middle
Maybe you want to do it the day

00:36:01.806 --> 00:36:03.456 A:middle
before or the day of a user's

00:36:03.456 --> 00:36:05.096 A:middle
expiry instead of having to do

00:36:05.096 --> 00:36:06.476 A:middle
it every five minutes.

00:36:07.276 --> 00:36:08.436 A:middle
So these are coming later this

00:36:08.436 --> 00:36:09.976 A:middle
year and we think it's going to

00:36:09.976 --> 00:36:11.956 A:middle
drastically improve and reduce

00:36:11.956 --> 00:36:13.406 A:middle
that subscription churn that you

00:36:13.406 --> 00:36:13.926 A:middle
might be seeing.

00:36:17.766 --> 00:36:18.526 A:middle
So let's bring up these

00:36:18.526 --> 00:36:19.676 A:middle
questions again that I asked

00:36:19.676 --> 00:36:20.236 A:middle
just before.

00:36:20.796 --> 00:36:22.596 A:middle
The new notifications is going

00:36:22.596 --> 00:36:24.026 A:middle
to do a great job of reducing

00:36:24.026 --> 00:36:24.676 A:middle
subscription churn.

00:36:24.806 --> 00:36:25.986 A:middle
You know via that technique that

00:36:25.986 --> 00:36:26.886 A:middle
we just saw but there's a lot of

00:36:26.886 --> 00:36:28.836 A:middle
information here that we still

00:36:28.836 --> 00:36:29.746 A:middle
don't have answers for

00:36:31.136 --> 00:36:33.166 A:middle
particularly about users before

00:36:33.166 --> 00:36:33.816 A:middle
they've expired.

00:36:34.246 --> 00:36:36.116 A:middle
So in order to give you access

00:36:36.186 --> 00:36:37.566 A:middle
to this specific information,

00:36:37.566 --> 00:36:38.756 A:middle
today we're announcing new

00:36:38.926 --> 00:36:40.536 A:middle
fields in the verify receipt

00:36:40.536 --> 00:36:40.916 A:middle
endpoint.

00:36:41.496 --> 00:36:42.866 A:middle
Now these new fields are going

00:36:42.866 --> 00:36:43.636 A:middle
to provide you with the

00:36:43.636 --> 00:36:45.266 A:middle
information specifically about

00:36:45.266 --> 00:36:46.736 A:middle
users along these key

00:36:46.736 --> 00:36:47.496 A:middle
subscription events.

00:36:47.496 --> 00:36:48.996 A:middle
So if they turn off auto renew

00:36:49.226 --> 00:36:50.156 A:middle
in the settings, you can now

00:36:50.156 --> 00:36:51.316 A:middle
know this ahead of time that

00:36:51.316 --> 00:36:52.556 A:middle
they've elected to not be

00:36:52.556 --> 00:36:53.956 A:middle
subscribed at the end of this

00:36:53.956 --> 00:36:55.456 A:middle
billing period or maybe they

00:36:55.456 --> 00:36:56.846 A:middle
cancel a receipt or refund at

00:36:57.056 --> 00:36:59.016 A:middle
the end and they won't have

00:36:59.016 --> 00:37:00.056 A:middle
their subscription continuing.

00:37:00.056 --> 00:37:00.906 A:middle
So you can act on this

00:37:00.906 --> 00:37:02.156 A:middle
information now ahead of time

00:37:02.156 --> 00:37:03.476 A:middle
and make key business decisions

00:37:03.736 --> 00:37:04.736 A:middle
about this information.

00:37:05.086 --> 00:37:06.056 A:middle
So let's look at the new fields

00:37:06.056 --> 00:37:06.736 A:middle
that we're including.

00:37:08.026 --> 00:37:09.316 A:middle
So this is that same request,

00:37:09.316 --> 00:37:10.646 A:middle
the verify receipt endpoint.

00:37:11.246 --> 00:37:12.236 A:middle
We're including now an auto

00:37:12.236 --> 00:37:13.106 A:middle
renew status.

00:37:13.726 --> 00:37:15.726 A:middle
So when a user elects to turn

00:37:15.726 --> 00:37:16.546 A:middle
off auto renew for a

00:37:16.546 --> 00:37:17.966 A:middle
subscription, you can find this

00:37:17.966 --> 00:37:19.316 A:middle
out now ahead of time before

00:37:19.316 --> 00:37:20.306 A:middle
they've actually expired their

00:37:20.306 --> 00:37:20.846 A:middle
subscription.

00:37:22.166 --> 00:37:23.186 A:middle
We're including an auto renew

00:37:23.186 --> 00:37:23.806 A:middle
preference.

00:37:24.306 --> 00:37:25.876 A:middle
So if a user elects to downgrade

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:26.976 A:middle
or change their subscription

00:37:26.976 --> 00:37:28.726 A:middle
preference, you can now know how

00:37:28.726 --> 00:37:29.366 A:middle
they're going to have -- what's

00:37:29.366 --> 00:37:30.226 A:middle
going to happen at the end of

00:37:30.226 --> 00:37:31.356 A:middle
that particular billing period.

00:37:32.126 --> 00:37:33.926 A:middle
We're including a price consent

00:37:33.926 --> 00:37:34.386 A:middle
status.

00:37:34.526 --> 00:37:35.626 A:middle
So if you're rolling a price

00:37:35.626 --> 00:37:37.156 A:middle
increase to a bunch of users,

00:37:37.376 --> 00:37:38.456 A:middle
now you can find out that I

00:37:38.776 --> 00:37:39.416 A:middle
don't know let's look at an

00:37:39.416 --> 00:37:39.706 A:middle
example.

00:37:39.706 --> 00:37:41.646 A:middle
Maybe 80% of your users haven't

00:37:41.646 --> 00:37:42.726 A:middle
agreed to a price increase and

00:37:42.726 --> 00:37:43.466 A:middle
they're actually going to be

00:37:43.466 --> 00:37:44.636 A:middle
unsubscribed at the end of the

00:37:44.636 --> 00:37:45.226 A:middle
billing period.

00:37:45.436 --> 00:37:46.716 A:middle
Previously you didn't know how

00:37:46.716 --> 00:37:47.676 A:middle
many users were going to be

00:37:47.676 --> 00:37:48.066 A:middle
rolled off.

00:37:48.066 --> 00:37:49.396 A:middle
So you can make key business

00:37:49.396 --> 00:37:50.476 A:middle
decisions based off that now.

00:37:50.706 --> 00:37:52.056 A:middle
Maybe you'll decide to not go

00:37:52.056 --> 00:37:53.016 A:middle
ahead with the price increase

00:37:53.066 --> 00:37:53.876 A:middle
based on the fact that you're

00:37:53.876 --> 00:37:54.476 A:middle
going to lose too many

00:37:54.476 --> 00:37:55.126 A:middle
subscribers.

00:37:56.856 --> 00:37:58.176 A:middle
We're including a subscription

00:37:58.176 --> 00:37:59.296 A:middle
billing retry flag.

00:37:59.986 --> 00:38:01.116 A:middle
So if a user falls into the

00:38:01.116 --> 00:38:02.616 A:middle
category of having some kind of

00:38:02.616 --> 00:38:04.006 A:middle
billing error like we saw before

00:38:04.326 --> 00:38:05.366 A:middle
and App Store is trying to

00:38:05.366 --> 00:38:06.516 A:middle
recharge their credit card to

00:38:06.516 --> 00:38:07.746 A:middle
get a successful transaction,

00:38:07.746 --> 00:38:09.286 A:middle
you can see if a user's in that

00:38:09.286 --> 00:38:09.606 A:middle
window.

00:38:09.606 --> 00:38:10.556 A:middle
And we'll see a couple of

00:38:10.556 --> 00:38:11.886 A:middle
examples about how to use these

00:38:11.886 --> 00:38:14.476 A:middle
in just a moment.

00:38:14.476 --> 00:38:15.496 A:middle
An expiration intent.

00:38:15.936 --> 00:38:17.596 A:middle
So why a user actually expired.

00:38:17.596 --> 00:38:18.616 A:middle
Was it because of a billing

00:38:18.616 --> 00:38:19.916 A:middle
error or some other reason?

00:38:19.916 --> 00:38:20.766 A:middle
You can now find this

00:38:20.766 --> 00:38:22.106 A:middle
information out about a user.

00:38:23.326 --> 00:38:24.136 A:middle
We're also including an

00:38:24.136 --> 00:38:25.126 A:middle
cancellation reason.

00:38:25.866 --> 00:38:28.106 A:middle
So previously if a user got a

00:38:28.106 --> 00:38:29.286 A:middle
refund from AppleCare, you were

00:38:29.286 --> 00:38:30.586 A:middle
going to kind of blind as to why

00:38:30.586 --> 00:38:31.186 A:middle
that was the case.

00:38:31.186 --> 00:38:32.646 A:middle
Now you can know if the user had

00:38:32.646 --> 00:38:34.096 A:middle
a problem with your app or an

00:38:34.096 --> 00:38:35.706 A:middle
in-app purchase or if it was

00:38:35.706 --> 00:38:36.896 A:middle
some personal reason the user

00:38:36.956 --> 00:38:38.466 A:middle
had in order to get a refund.

00:38:39.716 --> 00:38:40.766 A:middle
So let's look at a couple of

00:38:40.766 --> 00:38:41.746 A:middle
examples about how you can

00:38:41.746 --> 00:38:43.346 A:middle
actually use these fields in

00:38:43.346 --> 00:38:44.056 A:middle
order to address the

00:38:44.056 --> 00:38:45.186 A:middle
subscription turn that we talked

00:38:45.186 --> 00:38:45.406 A:middle
about.

00:38:45.506 --> 00:38:46.256 A:middle
Firstly, let's address

00:38:46.256 --> 00:38:47.566 A:middle
involuntary expiration.

00:38:47.636 --> 00:38:49.286 A:middle
So this is the case that a user

00:38:49.286 --> 00:38:50.546 A:middle
hasn't even elected to

00:38:50.546 --> 00:38:51.126 A:middle
unsubscribe.

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:52.956 A:middle
So we think there's a lot we can

00:38:52.956 --> 00:38:54.046 A:middle
do to address involuntary

00:38:54.046 --> 00:38:54.606 A:middle
expiration.

00:38:54.796 --> 00:38:55.746 A:middle
And so we're going to do what we

00:38:55.746 --> 00:38:57.616 A:middle
can on our end to address this.

00:38:57.616 --> 00:38:59.276 A:middle
And that includes expanding that

00:38:59.276 --> 00:39:01.096 A:middle
retry window for billing retry

00:39:01.426 --> 00:39:02.696 A:middle
to up to 60 days now.

00:39:03.436 --> 00:39:05.606 A:middle
So previously, we would only try

00:39:05.606 --> 00:39:07.096 A:middle
for a period of a few hours to

00:39:07.096 --> 00:39:08.636 A:middle
recharge a credit card if there

00:39:08.636 --> 00:39:09.486 A:middle
was any kind of issues.

00:39:09.486 --> 00:39:10.806 A:middle
Now we're expanding that right

00:39:10.806 --> 00:39:11.976 A:middle
out to be up to 60 days.

00:39:12.396 --> 00:39:13.606 A:middle
We think that's going to catch a

00:39:13.816 --> 00:39:16.096 A:middle
lot of unsubscribes that occur.

00:39:16.176 --> 00:39:17.416 A:middle
On your end, there's a couple of

00:39:17.416 --> 00:39:18.246 A:middle
things that you can do to

00:39:18.246 --> 00:39:19.296 A:middle
address these scenarios.

00:39:19.836 --> 00:39:22.176 A:middle
You can use that expiration

00:39:22.176 --> 00:39:23.666 A:middle
intent field and the

00:39:23.666 --> 00:39:25.186 A:middle
subscription retry flag to do a

00:39:25.186 --> 00:39:25.926 A:middle
few key things.

00:39:26.756 --> 00:39:27.576 A:middle
Now if there's anything that you

00:39:27.576 --> 00:39:29.606 A:middle
can get from this talk, let it

00:39:29.606 --> 00:39:31.796 A:middle
be these three points because if

00:39:31.796 --> 00:39:33.176 A:middle
you can go ahead and implement

00:39:33.176 --> 00:39:34.026 A:middle
these things that I'm about to

00:39:34.026 --> 00:39:35.376 A:middle
outline, you'll drastically

00:39:35.376 --> 00:39:36.506 A:middle
reduce your involuntary

00:39:36.506 --> 00:39:37.226 A:middle
subscription turn.

00:39:37.866 --> 00:39:39.306 A:middle
So firstly, you can use these

00:39:39.306 --> 00:39:41.186 A:middle
two fields to provide messaging

00:39:41.186 --> 00:39:41.676 A:middle
to your user.

00:39:42.016 --> 00:39:42.896 A:middle
If you see that they've had a

00:39:42.896 --> 00:39:44.516 A:middle
billing error, you can now tell

00:39:44.516 --> 00:39:45.656 A:middle
them to go ahead and update

00:39:45.906 --> 00:39:47.196 A:middle
their billing info in the app

00:39:47.196 --> 00:39:47.476 A:middle
store.

00:39:48.636 --> 00:39:50.846 A:middle
Number 2, you can offer a

00:39:50.846 --> 00:39:52.156 A:middle
downgraded or temporary

00:39:52.156 --> 00:39:53.556 A:middle
experience to users who are in

00:39:53.556 --> 00:39:54.416 A:middle
this retry window.

00:39:54.416 --> 00:39:55.396 A:middle
So if you see that they're in

00:39:55.396 --> 00:39:56.986 A:middle
billing retry window, maybe you

00:39:56.986 --> 00:39:58.696 A:middle
give them access to browse your

00:39:58.696 --> 00:39:59.936 A:middle
catalog or videos but you don't

00:39:59.936 --> 00:40:00.556 A:middle
let them watch them.

00:40:01.096 --> 00:40:01.946 A:middle
So give them some kind of

00:40:02.046 --> 00:40:03.236 A:middle
temporary experience in the

00:40:03.236 --> 00:40:03.606 A:middle
middle there.

00:40:04.216 --> 00:40:06.826 A:middle
And number three, use these new

00:40:06.826 --> 00:40:08.036 A:middle
server notifications.

00:40:08.036 --> 00:40:09.256 A:middle
Use the verify receipt endpoint

00:40:09.256 --> 00:40:10.526 A:middle
or any other technique to

00:40:10.606 --> 00:40:12.686 A:middle
unblock users as soon as their

00:40:12.686 --> 00:40:13.696 A:middle
subscription renews.

00:40:14.396 --> 00:40:15.856 A:middle
Now these sound like pretty

00:40:16.716 --> 00:40:17.876 A:middle
obvious examples but if you can

00:40:17.876 --> 00:40:19.256 A:middle
do these three things, there's a

00:40:19.256 --> 00:40:20.706 A:middle
lot of involuntary expiration

00:40:20.706 --> 00:40:22.666 A:middle
that you will save because of

00:40:22.666 --> 00:40:23.336 A:middle
these three things.

00:40:23.906 --> 00:40:25.796 A:middle
So there's some things you can

00:40:25.796 --> 00:40:26.956 A:middle
do for the voluntary case as

00:40:26.956 --> 00:40:27.196 A:middle
well.

00:40:27.286 --> 00:40:28.516 A:middle
So when a user has actually

00:40:28.516 --> 00:40:29.896 A:middle
voluntarily elected to

00:40:29.896 --> 00:40:31.076 A:middle
unsubscribe from your app, you

00:40:31.076 --> 00:40:32.306 A:middle
can use this information to help

00:40:32.306 --> 00:40:32.976 A:middle
you here as well.

00:40:33.736 --> 00:40:34.916 A:middle
There's that expiration intent

00:40:34.916 --> 00:40:35.956 A:middle
field that we're including now

00:40:36.006 --> 00:40:37.406 A:middle
and you can use this as a way to

00:40:37.406 --> 00:40:38.436 A:middle
offer messaging to those

00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:39.346 A:middle
particular users.

00:40:40.096 --> 00:40:41.166 A:middle
So let's say that a user

00:40:41.166 --> 00:40:41.586 A:middle
canceled.

00:40:42.376 --> 00:40:43.996 A:middle
You can maybe think well, let's

00:40:43.996 --> 00:40:45.256 A:middle
apply some kind of win back.

00:40:46.206 --> 00:40:47.366 A:middle
Maybe you rolled out a price

00:40:47.366 --> 00:40:49.246 A:middle
increase and the user expired

00:40:49.246 --> 00:40:50.566 A:middle
because they didn't consent to

00:40:50.566 --> 00:40:50.636 A:middle
it.

00:40:50.636 --> 00:40:52.206 A:middle
Well now you can offer maybe an

00:40:52.206 --> 00:40:53.306 A:middle
attractive downgrade option

00:40:53.306 --> 00:40:54.506 A:middle
because you know that it was

00:40:54.506 --> 00:40:55.266 A:middle
really about the price

00:40:55.266 --> 00:40:56.586 A:middle
difference that caused the user

00:40:56.586 --> 00:40:57.386 A:middle
to unsubscribe.

00:40:57.386 --> 00:40:58.786 A:middle
So you can see how you can use

00:40:58.996 --> 00:40:59.676 A:middle
just in these couple of

00:40:59.676 --> 00:41:00.976 A:middle
examples, these fields to now,

00:41:01.386 --> 00:41:02.306 A:middle
you know, make key business

00:41:02.306 --> 00:41:03.536 A:middle
decisions and how you interact

00:41:03.536 --> 00:41:04.686 A:middle
with your users and save

00:41:04.926 --> 00:41:05.636 A:middle
subscription churn.

00:41:07.596 --> 00:41:08.786 A:middle
These new fields are arriving

00:41:08.786 --> 00:41:10.046 A:middle
later this year along with the

00:41:10.046 --> 00:41:12.046 A:middle
server notifications and we

00:41:12.046 --> 00:41:13.176 A:middle
think this is going to give a

00:41:13.176 --> 00:41:14.556 A:middle
much better experience for all

00:41:14.556 --> 00:41:16.016 A:middle
users for your subscriptions and

00:41:16.016 --> 00:41:17.076 A:middle
for you developing it as well.

00:41:18.516 --> 00:41:24.546 A:middle
[ Clapping ]

00:41:25.046 --> 00:41:27.626 A:middle
They fit in this diagram as

00:41:27.626 --> 00:41:28.576 A:middle
another set of tools that you

00:41:28.576 --> 00:41:29.576 A:middle
can use for server side

00:41:29.576 --> 00:41:30.536 A:middle
subscription management

00:41:30.536 --> 00:41:31.716 A:middle
alongside the status polling

00:41:31.716 --> 00:41:32.446 A:middle
that we talked about.

00:41:32.446 --> 00:41:33.826 A:middle
But of course, you still need to

00:41:33.826 --> 00:41:35.616 A:middle
be relying on this flow of

00:41:35.616 --> 00:41:36.446 A:middle
updating and finishing

00:41:36.446 --> 00:41:38.276 A:middle
transactions on a user's device.

00:41:39.206 --> 00:41:40.546 A:middle
So while we're talking about

00:41:40.546 --> 00:41:41.476 A:middle
subscriptions, I just want to

00:41:41.476 --> 00:41:43.486 A:middle
touch on free trials for a

00:41:44.416 --> 00:41:44.646 A:middle
moment.

00:41:44.756 --> 00:41:45.936 A:middle
Free trial is when a user can

00:41:46.156 --> 00:41:47.366 A:middle
begin a subscription without

00:41:47.366 --> 00:41:48.746 A:middle
actually paying for anything.

00:41:49.176 --> 00:41:50.626 A:middle
And they are not billed until

00:41:50.626 --> 00:41:51.616 A:middle
the free trial period is

00:41:51.616 --> 00:41:52.106 A:middle
actually over.

00:41:53.566 --> 00:41:55.996 A:middle
So previously, we had this

00:41:56.476 --> 00:41:57.666 A:middle
pretty convoluted looking table

00:41:57.666 --> 00:41:59.136 A:middle
and you'd have an associated

00:41:59.136 --> 00:42:00.726 A:middle
free trial duration for a

00:42:00.726 --> 00:42:01.546 A:middle
subscription length.

00:42:01.876 --> 00:42:03.376 A:middle
And you had to choose which

00:42:03.376 --> 00:42:04.836 A:middle
trials you could offer based on

00:42:04.836 --> 00:42:05.716 A:middle
the subscription length that you

00:42:05.716 --> 00:42:06.536 A:middle
were offering users.

00:42:06.536 --> 00:42:07.416 A:middle
Now we made some changes

00:42:07.416 --> 00:42:08.956 A:middle
recently to make this much

00:42:08.956 --> 00:42:09.256 A:middle
simpler.

00:42:09.256 --> 00:42:10.606 A:middle
So you can now have any

00:42:10.606 --> 00:42:11.856 A:middle
subscription length available

00:42:11.856 --> 00:42:13.256 A:middle
for any free trial duration.

00:42:13.256 --> 00:42:14.596 A:middle
So we think is a much better

00:42:14.596 --> 00:42:16.206 A:middle
improvement and this includes

00:42:16.546 --> 00:42:18.106 A:middle
two new free trial durations as

00:42:18.106 --> 00:42:19.126 A:middle
well, which is the three-day

00:42:19.126 --> 00:42:20.576 A:middle
trial and the two-week trial.

00:42:20.576 --> 00:42:21.766 A:middle
These are two new trial

00:42:21.766 --> 00:42:22.766 A:middle
durations that you can offer to

00:42:22.766 --> 00:42:23.376 A:middle
your users.

00:42:23.926 --> 00:42:26.456 A:middle
So that's a bit about

00:42:26.456 --> 00:42:27.806 A:middle
maintaining subscription state

00:42:27.806 --> 00:42:28.996 A:middle
and talking about managing auto

00:42:28.996 --> 00:42:29.986 A:middle
renewable subscriptions in the

00:42:29.986 --> 00:42:30.236 A:middle
server.

00:42:30.236 --> 00:42:32.176 A:middle
I'd like to touch now on

00:42:32.266 --> 00:42:33.596 A:middle
developing in the sandbox

00:42:33.596 --> 00:42:34.116 A:middle
environment.

00:42:34.226 --> 00:42:35.076 A:middle
So how you can use these

00:42:35.076 --> 00:42:36.286 A:middle
technologies while you're

00:42:36.286 --> 00:42:36.746 A:middle
developing.

00:42:37.406 --> 00:42:38.796 A:middle
So what is the sandbox?

00:42:39.606 --> 00:42:40.556 A:middle
Well it's not to be confused

00:42:40.556 --> 00:42:41.726 A:middle
with the sandbox on your

00:42:41.726 --> 00:42:43.166 A:middle
application, on a user's device

00:42:43.206 --> 00:42:44.146 A:middle
that guards access to

00:42:44.146 --> 00:42:45.226 A:middle
application resources.

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:47.736 A:middle
This particular sandbox is the

00:42:47.736 --> 00:42:48.806 A:middle
test environment that we offer

00:42:48.806 --> 00:42:50.176 A:middle
for you to test out in-app

00:42:50.176 --> 00:42:50.746 A:middle
purchases in.

00:42:51.406 --> 00:42:53.026 A:middle
And we select it based on the

00:42:53.026 --> 00:42:54.126 A:middle
certificate that's actually used

00:42:54.126 --> 00:42:55.216 A:middle
to sign your application.

00:42:55.726 --> 00:42:56.946 A:middle
It's how StoreKit knows whether

00:42:56.946 --> 00:42:58.236 A:middle
to be in a sandbox mode or not.

00:42:58.646 --> 00:43:00.446 A:middle
So if you build and run your app

00:43:00.446 --> 00:43:01.006 A:middle
from Xcode [phonetic].

00:43:01.006 --> 00:43:02.236 A:middle
It's signed using your developer

00:43:02.236 --> 00:43:03.656 A:middle
certificate and StoreKit knows

00:43:03.656 --> 00:43:04.846 A:middle
that it needs to be talking to

00:43:04.846 --> 00:43:05.916 A:middle
the sandbox environment.

00:43:06.016 --> 00:43:07.926 A:middle
Of course, if you distribute it

00:43:07.926 --> 00:43:09.776 A:middle
using the App Store, well

00:43:09.926 --> 00:43:10.896 A:middle
StoreKit knows that it needs to

00:43:10.896 --> 00:43:11.696 A:middle
talk to the production

00:43:11.696 --> 00:43:12.476 A:middle
environment based on the

00:43:12.476 --> 00:43:14.116 A:middle
certificate used to sign your

00:43:14.116 --> 00:43:14.306 A:middle
app.

00:43:15.546 --> 00:43:16.506 A:middle
And how do you know when you're

00:43:16.506 --> 00:43:18.026 A:middle
actually working with app which

00:43:18.076 --> 00:43:19.616 A:middle
environment you're in?

00:43:20.566 --> 00:43:21.426 A:middle
When you make your in-app

00:43:21.426 --> 00:43:22.276 A:middle
purchase inside your

00:43:22.276 --> 00:43:23.996 A:middle
application, you get this

00:43:23.996 --> 00:43:24.996 A:middle
payment sheet that we saw in

00:43:24.996 --> 00:43:25.756 A:middle
this morning's session.

00:43:26.666 --> 00:43:28.096 A:middle
And we have this indication here

00:43:28.096 --> 00:43:29.156 A:middle
that you're in sandbox mode.

00:43:29.156 --> 00:43:30.146 A:middle
So this is going to inform you

00:43:30.146 --> 00:43:31.336 A:middle
that the payment that's about to

00:43:31.336 --> 00:43:33.216 A:middle
take place is actually a sandbox

00:43:33.216 --> 00:43:34.676 A:middle
payment and no real money is

00:43:34.676 --> 00:43:35.936 A:middle
going to be changing hands.

00:43:36.506 --> 00:43:39.386 A:middle
So the key differences between

00:43:39.386 --> 00:43:40.446 A:middle
the sandbox and the production

00:43:40.446 --> 00:43:41.256 A:middle
environment, well the biggest

00:43:41.256 --> 00:43:42.006 A:middle
one, of course, is that there's

00:43:42.006 --> 00:43:43.556 A:middle
no real money being changed

00:43:43.556 --> 00:43:43.966 A:middle
hands here.

00:43:43.966 --> 00:43:45.376 A:middle
There's no actual charge

00:43:45.376 --> 00:43:45.726 A:middle
happening.

00:43:45.726 --> 00:43:46.866 A:middle
So you don't need to be charging

00:43:46.866 --> 00:43:48.036 A:middle
your personal card 10-cent

00:43:48.036 --> 00:43:49.476 A:middle
transactions all the time.

00:43:49.826 --> 00:43:51.266 A:middle
There's a different endpoint as

00:43:51.266 --> 00:43:51.886 A:middle
well when it comes to

00:43:51.886 --> 00:43:53.346 A:middle
server-to-server validation.

00:43:53.716 --> 00:43:54.946 A:middle
We provide a different url for

00:43:54.946 --> 00:43:56.266 A:middle
that verify receipt endpoint.

00:43:56.986 --> 00:43:58.346 A:middle
And you can also request expired

00:43:58.346 --> 00:43:59.896 A:middle
and revoked certificates in the

00:43:59.896 --> 00:44:01.036 A:middle
sandbox environment to be able

00:44:01.036 --> 00:44:01.776 A:middle
to handle them a little

00:44:01.776 --> 00:44:02.156 A:middle
differently.

00:44:03.376 --> 00:44:04.746 A:middle
The other thing that is

00:44:04.746 --> 00:44:06.336 A:middle
different is a time contraction

00:44:06.516 --> 00:44:07.146 A:middle
for auto renewable

00:44:07.146 --> 00:44:07.836 A:middle
subscriptions.

00:44:08.296 --> 00:44:09.276 A:middle
So instead of having to wait a

00:44:09.276 --> 00:44:10.726 A:middle
full year for a subscription to

00:44:10.726 --> 00:44:11.776 A:middle
renew to be able to test out

00:44:11.776 --> 00:44:13.096 A:middle
that scenario, we can track

00:44:13.146 --> 00:44:13.996 A:middle
these time intervals.

00:44:14.426 --> 00:44:15.856 A:middle
So the rule of thumb is that one

00:44:15.856 --> 00:44:17.056 A:middle
hour of time in the sandbox

00:44:17.056 --> 00:44:19.026 A:middle
world equals one year of time in

00:44:19.026 --> 00:44:19.606 A:middle
the real world.

00:44:19.606 --> 00:44:21.716 A:middle
And this is how those relate for

00:44:21.716 --> 00:44:22.466 A:middle
the various different

00:44:22.466 --> 00:44:23.576 A:middle
subscription durations.

00:44:24.096 --> 00:44:26.296 A:middle
The other thing that we do when

00:44:26.296 --> 00:44:27.406 A:middle
you're operating in a sandbox

00:44:27.406 --> 00:44:28.506 A:middle
environment is that if you are

00:44:28.506 --> 00:44:30.046 A:middle
subscribed to an auto renewable

00:44:30.046 --> 00:44:32.036 A:middle
subscription, we only renew it

00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:34.586 A:middle
after six times per eight-hour

00:44:34.586 --> 00:44:34.876 A:middle
window.

00:44:36.156 --> 00:44:37.626 A:middle
Then we let it expire.

00:44:37.816 --> 00:44:39.406 A:middle
So you can handle the case where

00:44:39.406 --> 00:44:40.436 A:middle
a user has actually let their

00:44:40.436 --> 00:44:41.496 A:middle
subscription lapse and you can

00:44:41.786 --> 00:44:43.056 A:middle
handle that in your application

00:44:43.056 --> 00:44:43.516 A:middle
accordingly.

00:44:45.536 --> 00:44:46.836 A:middle
When it comes to setting up this

00:44:46.836 --> 00:44:47.886 A:middle
test environment, it's done

00:44:47.886 --> 00:44:48.826 A:middle
through iTunes Connect.

00:44:49.406 --> 00:44:50.776 A:middle
You create test users in iTunes

00:44:50.776 --> 00:44:52.156 A:middle
Connect and you can just those

00:44:52.156 --> 00:44:53.146 A:middle
in-app purchase products that

00:44:53.146 --> 00:44:54.706 A:middle
you've already got for sale and

00:44:54.706 --> 00:44:55.946 A:middle
then you just build and sign

00:44:55.946 --> 00:44:56.886 A:middle
your app using XCode.

00:44:57.086 --> 00:44:58.206 A:middle
So it's built and signed using

00:44:58.206 --> 00:44:59.356 A:middle
the developer certificate.

00:44:59.816 --> 00:45:00.986 A:middle
And you just go ahead and buy

00:45:00.986 --> 00:45:02.016 A:middle
products in your application.

00:45:02.016 --> 00:45:03.346 A:middle
And when you're prompted to sign

00:45:03.346 --> 00:45:04.856 A:middle
in, you'll be able to sign in

00:45:04.856 --> 00:45:06.716 A:middle
using that test user that you

00:45:06.716 --> 00:45:07.656 A:middle
made in iTunes Connect.

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:10.046 A:middle
One note if you are developing

00:45:10.046 --> 00:45:11.746 A:middle
for the Mac, you may need to

00:45:11.746 --> 00:45:13.146 A:middle
launch your app once from Finder

00:45:13.226 --> 00:45:14.716 A:middle
just in order to make sure that

00:45:14.716 --> 00:45:15.756 A:middle
the receipt gets fetched.

00:45:16.486 --> 00:45:18.146 A:middle
This is because that exit code

00:45:18.146 --> 00:45:19.006 A:middle
that we mentioned earlier on in

00:45:19.006 --> 00:45:21.106 A:middle
the talk where you exit 173 on a

00:45:21.106 --> 00:45:23.296 A:middle
Mac, well XCode catches that if

00:45:23.296 --> 00:45:24.066 A:middle
you're building and running

00:45:24.066 --> 00:45:25.156 A:middle
straight from XCode the first

00:45:25.156 --> 00:45:25.336 A:middle
time.

00:45:25.336 --> 00:45:26.126 A:middle
You need to make sure that you

00:45:26.126 --> 00:45:27.606 A:middle
launch the app once that binary

00:45:27.606 --> 00:45:29.036 A:middle
from Finder so that StoreKit can

00:45:29.036 --> 00:45:30.816 A:middle
catch that exit code and handle

00:45:30.816 --> 00:45:31.346 A:middle
it appropriately.

00:45:31.956 --> 00:45:34.476 A:middle
In terms of using the sandbox

00:45:34.476 --> 00:45:35.306 A:middle
from the server, I mentioned

00:45:35.306 --> 00:45:36.076 A:middle
that we have a different

00:45:36.266 --> 00:45:37.816 A:middle
endpoint for the verify receipt

00:45:37.816 --> 00:45:37.883 A:middle
url.

00:45:37.883 --> 00:45:39.826 A:middle
This is what it looks like in

00:45:39.826 --> 00:45:40.736 A:middle
the development environment.

00:45:40.736 --> 00:45:41.516 A:middle
You'll probably have your

00:45:41.686 --> 00:45:43.226 A:middle
developer signed app probably

00:45:43.226 --> 00:45:44.996 A:middle
talking to your test server and

00:45:44.996 --> 00:45:46.506 A:middle
that test server can talk to the

00:45:46.506 --> 00:45:47.716 A:middle
App Store sandbox by the

00:45:47.716 --> 00:45:48.406 A:middle
different url.

00:45:49.596 --> 00:45:50.346 A:middle
In production, you'll have

00:45:50.346 --> 00:45:50.946 A:middle
something like this.

00:45:50.946 --> 00:45:52.306 A:middle
Your production app will talk to

00:45:52.306 --> 00:45:53.936 A:middle
your production server and that

00:45:53.936 --> 00:45:54.996 A:middle
can talk to the production App

00:45:54.996 --> 00:45:56.626 A:middle
Store server but there is one

00:45:56.626 --> 00:45:57.906 A:middle
particularly case where there's

00:45:57.906 --> 00:45:58.756 A:middle
a bit of a mismatch.

00:45:59.806 --> 00:46:00.936 A:middle
And that's when your app is in

00:46:00.936 --> 00:46:01.516 A:middle
app review.

00:46:01.516 --> 00:46:04.026 A:middle
And why is it a mismatch?

00:46:04.026 --> 00:46:05.546 A:middle
It's because the app review team

00:46:05.546 --> 00:46:07.366 A:middle
actually uses a sandbox user to

00:46:07.366 --> 00:46:08.476 A:middle
be able to test your in-app

00:46:08.476 --> 00:46:09.146 A:middle
purchases.

00:46:09.876 --> 00:46:10.926 A:middle
So this is what that looks like.

00:46:10.926 --> 00:46:12.296 A:middle
You have your production signed

00:46:12.296 --> 00:46:13.986 A:middle
app talking to your production

00:46:13.986 --> 00:46:15.216 A:middle
server but you need to be able

00:46:15.216 --> 00:46:17.396 A:middle
to verify transactions for a

00:46:17.396 --> 00:46:18.736 A:middle
sandbox user just to get through

00:46:18.736 --> 00:46:19.826 A:middle
the app review scenario.

00:46:19.826 --> 00:46:21.136 A:middle
So how do you handle this

00:46:21.186 --> 00:46:22.056 A:middle
particular mismatch?

00:46:22.546 --> 00:46:23.616 A:middle
Well we have a way of doing

00:46:23.616 --> 00:46:23.866 A:middle
this.

00:46:24.836 --> 00:46:25.966 A:middle
Firstly, when you're in the

00:46:25.966 --> 00:46:28.756 A:middle
production environment try the

00:46:28.756 --> 00:46:30.306 A:middle
production App Store url first.

00:46:31.296 --> 00:46:32.526 A:middle
Now if the receipt is for the

00:46:32.526 --> 00:46:33.536 A:middle
sandbox, you'll receive a

00:46:33.536 --> 00:46:35.766 A:middle
specific error code, 21 double 0

00:46:35.766 --> 00:46:35.946 A:middle
7.

00:46:36.606 --> 00:46:37.526 A:middle
That's an indication that you

00:46:37.526 --> 00:46:39.556 A:middle
need to then to try against the

00:46:39.556 --> 00:46:40.966 A:middle
App Store sandbox instead.

00:46:41.406 --> 00:46:42.516 A:middle
So you can leave that in your

00:46:42.516 --> 00:46:43.716 A:middle
production environment and this

00:46:43.716 --> 00:46:44.586 A:middle
will just mean that your app is

00:46:44.586 --> 00:46:45.906 A:middle
able to sail through app review

00:46:46.146 --> 00:46:47.126 A:middle
without any problems in this

00:46:47.126 --> 00:46:47.436 A:middle
regard.

00:46:47.436 --> 00:46:50.516 A:middle
When it comes to the new server

00:46:50.516 --> 00:46:52.426 A:middle
to server notifications, this is

00:46:52.426 --> 00:46:53.456 A:middle
handled slightly differently.

00:46:53.456 --> 00:46:54.586 A:middle
So we don't actually have a

00:46:54.586 --> 00:46:56.206 A:middle
separate url in iTunes Connect

00:46:56.526 --> 00:46:58.166 A:middle
for a sandbox -- or for your own

00:46:58.166 --> 00:46:58.716 A:middle
test server.

00:46:59.686 --> 00:47:01.116 A:middle
We handle this sandboxing by

00:47:01.116 --> 00:47:02.416 A:middle
parameter in the actual payload

00:47:02.746 --> 00:47:03.666 A:middle
of the notification.

00:47:03.666 --> 00:47:04.846 A:middle
So there's an environment key

00:47:04.846 --> 00:47:06.226 A:middle
that you can use that'll tell

00:47:06.226 --> 00:47:06.856 A:middle
you whether or not the

00:47:06.856 --> 00:47:09.716 A:middle
notification is for a sandbox

00:47:09.716 --> 00:47:11.046 A:middle
subscription or whether it's for

00:47:11.046 --> 00:47:11.626 A:middle
a production one.

00:47:12.206 --> 00:47:15.226 A:middle
So that's a bit about developing

00:47:15.226 --> 00:47:16.156 A:middle
now in a sandbox.

00:47:16.226 --> 00:47:17.506 A:middle
So we touched on a few things

00:47:17.506 --> 00:47:17.716 A:middle
today.

00:47:17.716 --> 00:47:18.236 A:middle
There's been a lot of

00:47:18.236 --> 00:47:18.836 A:middle
information.

00:47:19.566 --> 00:47:20.866 A:middle
Let's just go through again what

00:47:20.866 --> 00:47:21.406 A:middle
we talked about.

00:47:21.406 --> 00:47:22.186 A:middle
We talked about receipt

00:47:22.186 --> 00:47:22.956 A:middle
validation in detail.

00:47:22.956 --> 00:47:24.376 A:middle
How to do this on a user's

00:47:24.376 --> 00:47:25.826 A:middle
device and how to check that

00:47:25.826 --> 00:47:27.506 A:middle
document for authenticity and

00:47:27.506 --> 00:47:29.526 A:middle
read out transactions from it.

00:47:29.526 --> 00:47:30.896 A:middle
We talked about maintaining a

00:47:30.896 --> 00:47:32.606 A:middle
subscription state across a

00:47:32.606 --> 00:47:33.506 A:middle
server environment.

00:47:33.506 --> 00:47:35.486 A:middle
How to update devices and act on

00:47:35.486 --> 00:47:36.776 A:middle
that verify receipt endpoint.

00:47:37.916 --> 00:47:40.146 A:middle
We have new notifications that

00:47:40.146 --> 00:47:41.136 A:middle
we're introducing that's going

00:47:41.136 --> 00:47:42.246 A:middle
to unblock and save a lot of

00:47:42.246 --> 00:47:43.486 A:middle
that involuntary subscription

00:47:43.486 --> 00:47:43.646 A:middle
churn.

00:47:44.026 --> 00:47:45.336 A:middle
Provide a much better experience

00:47:45.336 --> 00:47:45.976 A:middle
for your users.

00:47:46.756 --> 00:47:48.216 A:middle
We're also introducing those new

00:47:48.216 --> 00:47:48.896 A:middle
receipt fields.

00:47:48.896 --> 00:47:50.146 A:middle
So you can make key decisions

00:47:50.386 --> 00:47:51.846 A:middle
based on business information

00:47:51.846 --> 00:47:53.766 A:middle
about your users and now message

00:47:53.766 --> 00:47:54.756 A:middle
them much more directly.

00:47:55.456 --> 00:47:56.666 A:middle
Remember those three easy steps

00:47:56.666 --> 00:47:57.866 A:middle
to retain subscribers.

00:47:58.266 --> 00:47:59.406 A:middle
Three steps to success.

00:48:00.216 --> 00:48:01.366 A:middle
So if you do these three things,

00:48:01.566 --> 00:48:03.006 A:middle
this will, I kid you not, it'll

00:48:03.006 --> 00:48:04.386 A:middle
save you a ton of involuntary

00:48:04.386 --> 00:48:05.136 A:middle
subscription churns.

00:48:05.136 --> 00:48:06.576 A:middle
So please go ahead and do these

00:48:06.576 --> 00:48:07.656 A:middle
when these fields come out later

00:48:07.656 --> 00:48:08.026 A:middle
this year.

00:48:08.426 --> 00:48:09.466 A:middle
And finally we talked about

00:48:09.706 --> 00:48:10.536 A:middle
sandbox development.

00:48:10.536 --> 00:48:11.286 A:middle
Being able to use these

00:48:11.286 --> 00:48:12.526 A:middle
technologies in the sandbox

00:48:12.526 --> 00:48:13.026 A:middle
environment.

00:48:13.266 --> 00:48:14.666 A:middle
So for more information on this

00:48:14.666 --> 00:48:16.116 A:middle
session and to see the slides

00:48:16.116 --> 00:48:17.446 A:middle
and follow any links, this is

00:48:17.446 --> 00:48:18.416 A:middle
session 305.

00:48:18.416 --> 00:48:19.576 A:middle
You can check it out on the

00:48:19.576 --> 00:48:20.346 A:middle
developer website.

00:48:21.316 --> 00:48:22.136 A:middle
We did have some related

00:48:22.186 --> 00:48:23.796 A:middle
sessions earlier this week.

00:48:23.796 --> 00:48:24.456 A:middle
We're kind of at the end of the

00:48:24.456 --> 00:48:24.866 A:middle
week now.

00:48:25.196 --> 00:48:26.236 A:middle
But we are still here in the

00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:27.626 A:middle
labs all afternoon this

00:48:27.626 --> 00:48:28.046 A:middle
afternoon.

00:48:28.046 --> 00:48:29.956 A:middle
So we have engineers from both

00:48:29.956 --> 00:48:31.536 A:middle
the client and from the service

00:48:31.536 --> 00:48:32.826 A:middle
side from all across the

00:48:32.826 --> 00:48:34.206 A:middle
organization down in the

00:48:34.206 --> 00:48:35.266 A:middle
StoreKit labs, both this

00:48:35.266 --> 00:48:36.236 A:middle
afternoon and tomorrow

00:48:36.236 --> 00:48:36.566 A:middle
afternoon.

00:48:36.826 --> 00:48:38.456 A:middle
So please come and say hi and

00:48:38.686 --> 00:48:39.796 A:middle
bombard us with questions.

00:48:39.796 --> 00:48:40.986 A:middle
And we're happy to help you out

00:48:40.986 --> 00:48:42.066 A:middle
and talk about how you're

00:48:42.066 --> 00:48:43.236 A:middle
architecting your solutions.

00:48:43.636 --> 00:48:44.886 A:middle
But until then, thanks for

00:48:44.886 --> 00:48:45.366 A:middle

00:48:45.366 --> 00:48:46.286 A:middle
Thanks for your time.

00:48:46.286 --> 00:48:46.956 A:middle
Enjoy your afternoon.

00:48:47.516 --> 00:48:51.500 A:middle
