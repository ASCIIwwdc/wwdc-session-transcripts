&gt;&gt; So watchOS is moving forward

00:09:52.436 --> 00:09:53.346 A:middle
really quickly.

00:09:53.346 --> 00:09:54.686 A:middle
And I'm very excited to

00:09:54.686 --> 00:09:56.586 A:middle
introduce watchOS 4 today.

00:09:57.106 --> 00:09:58.376 A:middle
This furthers the areas that

00:09:58.376 --> 00:09:59.206 A:middle
people love.

00:09:59.206 --> 00:10:00.926 A:middle
It also introduces new ways to

00:10:00.926 --> 00:10:02.406 A:middle
make the watch more personal to

00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:02.906 A:middle
you.

00:10:03.056 --> 00:10:05.496 A:middle
Let's start with watch faces.

00:10:05.626 --> 00:10:06.806 A:middle
Now, Apple Watch is great for

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:08.056 A:middle
quickly glancing at information.

00:10:08.056 --> 00:10:08.866 A:middle
And many people are using a

00:10:08.866 --> 00:10:10.066 A:middle
watch face like this today.

00:10:10.416 --> 00:10:11.486 A:middle
And now, you need to choose what

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:12.606 A:middle
information shows up here.

00:10:12.606 --> 00:10:14.246 A:middle
So for example weather, calendar

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:15.576 A:middle
and workouts, or maybe you'd

00:10:15.576 --> 00:10:16.826 A:middle
like to look at the date and

00:10:16.826 --> 00:10:18.326 A:middle
reminders and sunset.

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:19.826 A:middle
The information that you like to

00:10:19.896 --> 00:10:21.016 A:middle
see actually varies based on

00:10:21.016 --> 00:10:22.546 A:middle
time and your location and your

00:10:22.546 --> 00:10:22.946 A:middle
routines.

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:24.616 A:middle
What if we could actually show

00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:25.906 A:middle
you a selection of information

00:10:25.906 --> 00:10:26.606 A:middle
that you might need

00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:27.546 A:middle
automatically?

00:10:28.526 --> 00:10:29.876 A:middle
Well, Siri is becoming more and

00:10:29.876 --> 00:10:31.246 A:middle
more a proactive assistant

00:10:31.326 --> 00:10:32.386 A:middle
knowing what information you

00:10:32.386 --> 00:10:33.616 A:middle
need when you need it.

00:10:33.976 --> 00:10:35.246 A:middle
And we've created a new watch

00:10:35.246 --> 00:10:36.726 A:middle
face, which is powered by Siri

00:10:36.726 --> 00:10:37.326 A:middle
intelligence.

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:39.086 A:middle
This is the new Siri watch face.

00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:40.906 A:middle
Now, it automatically displays

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:41.966 A:middle
the information that's most

00:10:41.966 --> 00:10:42.716 A:middle
relevant to you.

00:10:42.716 --> 00:10:44.296 A:middle
And it can also access Siri by

00:10:44.296 --> 00:10:45.576 A:middle
tapping on the new complication

00:10:45.576 --> 00:10:46.256 A:middle
on the top left.

00:10:46.256 --> 00:10:48.146 A:middle
And it automatically displays

00:10:48.146 --> 00:10:49.496 A:middle
this information with the same

00:10:49.496 --> 00:10:50.626 A:middle
type of intelligence we've

00:10:50.626 --> 00:10:51.676 A:middle
applied on iOS.

00:10:52.116 --> 00:10:53.286 A:middle
We're using machine learning to

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:54.606 A:middle
adapt automatically based on

00:10:54.606 --> 00:10:56.166 A:middle
your routines and the apps that

00:10:56.166 --> 00:10:57.366 A:middle
you use when you use them.

00:10:57.976 --> 00:10:59.016 A:middle
So in the morning, I might see

00:10:59.016 --> 00:11:01.166 A:middle
for example, can you time in my

00:11:01.166 --> 00:11:01.886 A:middle
first meeting.

00:11:01.966 --> 00:11:03.466 A:middle
And if I rotate the Crown, I can

00:11:03.466 --> 00:11:05.296 A:middle
see more information from Siri.

00:11:05.626 --> 00:11:07.086 A:middle
For example, reminders or even

00:11:07.086 --> 00:11:08.866 A:middle
photo memories from the same

00:11:08.866 --> 00:11:10.086 A:middle
time last year or maybe from

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:10.836 A:middle
this location.

00:11:11.166 --> 00:11:12.136 A:middle
And throughout the day, whenever

00:11:12.136 --> 00:11:13.736 A:middle
you raise your wrist, the face

00:11:13.736 --> 00:11:14.996 A:middle
will dynamically update with the

00:11:14.996 --> 00:11:15.826 A:middle
information for you.

00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:17.736 A:middle
So for example at noon, I might

00:11:17.786 --> 00:11:19.146 A:middle
see a reminder to make a call

00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:20.466 A:middle
and I might get a pass to a

00:11:20.466 --> 00:11:21.316 A:middle
flight that I'm taking that

00:11:21.316 --> 00:11:21.926 A:middle
afternoon.

00:11:22.206 --> 00:11:23.576 A:middle
So, relevant passes in Wallet

00:11:23.576 --> 00:11:24.406 A:middle
can appear here right in the

apps.

00:11:26.426 --> 00:11:28.336 A:middle
Now, at the end of the day, I

00:11:28.336 --> 00:11:29.396 A:middle
might see what time the sun is

00:11:29.396 --> 00:11:30.626 A:middle
going to set and also, I can get

00:11:30.626 --> 00:11:32.716 A:middle
access to controls I tend to use

00:11:32.716 --> 00:11:34.016 A:middle
in the home app at night.

kind of less information and

more graphics.

Now, this is one of the most

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:27.436 A:middle
popular workouts in the world.

00:14:27.436 --> 00:14:28.496 A:middle
So we know it's going to be a

00:14:28.496 --> 00:14:29.406 A:middle
favorite for a lot of you when

00:14:29.406 --> 00:14:30.126 A:middle
you start using it.

00:14:31.196 --> 00:14:32.306 A:middle
Now, if you like to do more than

00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:33.916 A:middle
one workout in a row, it's now

00:14:34.016 --> 00:14:35.926 A:middle
super easy to just swipe over

00:14:35.926 --> 00:14:37.416 A:middle
during a current workout and

00:14:37.416 --> 00:14:38.716 A:middle
then add another one by pressing

00:14:38.716 --> 00:14:39.516 A:middle
the plus button.

00:14:39.756 --> 00:14:41.306 A:middle
You just press plus and I can

00:14:41.386 --> 00:14:42.576 A:middle
continue with another workout.

00:14:42.576 --> 00:14:43.946 A:middle
For example, I might do outdoor

00:14:43.946 --> 00:14:44.706 A:middle
cycling here.

00:14:44.976 --> 00:14:47.066 A:middle
I just tap and I continue, super

00:14:47.066 --> 00:14:48.636 A:middle
easy now to do multiple workouts

00:14:48.736 --> 00:14:49.626 A:middle
in a single session.

00:14:55.276 --> 00:14:56.326 A:middle
Now, many people are doing the

00:14:56.326 --> 00:14:58.026 A:middle
workouts indoors at a gym.

00:14:58.026 --> 00:15:00.006 A:middle
And when you use gym equipment,

00:15:00.256 --> 00:15:01.476 A:middle
it has data the Apple Watch

00:15:01.476 --> 00:15:02.726 A:middle
doesn't have and the watch has

00:15:02.726 --> 00:15:04.356 A:middle
data the gym equipment doesn't

00:15:04.356 --> 00:15:04.626 A:middle
have.

00:15:04.766 --> 00:15:06.366 A:middle
So you end up with numbers like

00:15:06.366 --> 00:15:07.586 A:middle
calories and distance that don't

00:15:07.586 --> 00:15:08.156 A:middle
quite match.

00:15:08.656 --> 00:15:10.116 A:middle
So in watchOS 4, we've come up

00:15:10.116 --> 00:15:11.446 A:middle
with a great solution to this.

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:13.496 A:middle
We're enabling for the first

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:15.316 A:middle
time two-way data exchange in

00:15:15.316 --> 00:15:16.826 A:middle
real-time with gym equipment.

00:15:16.826 --> 00:15:18.666 A:middle
So you'll be able to simply tap

00:15:18.666 --> 00:15:20.376 A:middle
your Apple Watch, on an NFC

00:15:20.376 --> 00:15:21.616 A:middle
reader on the gym equipment.

00:15:21.826 --> 00:15:22.746 A:middle
Your watch will automatically

00:15:22.746 --> 00:15:23.796 A:middle
launch the Workout App and you

00:15:23.796 --> 00:15:24.246 A:middle
can connect.

00:15:24.396 --> 00:15:25.976 A:middle
And then your heart rate is read

00:15:25.976 --> 00:15:27.266 A:middle
by the watch and sent to the

00:15:27.266 --> 00:15:27.866 A:middle
equipment.

00:15:27.866 --> 00:15:29.416 A:middle
And data like incline and speed

00:15:29.416 --> 00:15:30.566 A:middle
is sent from the equipment to

00:15:30.566 --> 00:15:31.166 A:middle
your watch.

00:15:31.266 --> 00:15:32.436 A:middle
And when you start and stop the

00:15:32.436 --> 00:15:33.696 A:middle
workout in your gym machine, it

00:15:33.696 --> 00:15:34.706 A:middle
does the same thing on your

00:15:34.706 --> 00:15:35.056 A:middle
watch.

00:15:35.426 --> 00:15:36.446 A:middle
So now, all the information

00:15:36.446 --> 00:15:38.146 A:middle
matches, it's much easier and

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.166 A:middle
it's a lot more accurate.

00:15:39.766 --> 00:15:40.946 A:middle
Now, this is being supported by

00:15:40.946 --> 00:15:42.676 A:middle
the largest gym manufacturers in

00:15:42.676 --> 00:15:44.786 A:middle

00:15:44.786 --> 00:15:45.936 A:middle
equipment in gyms today.

00:15:46.376 --> 00:15:47.536 A:middle
And Apple Watch-enabled

00:15:47.536 --> 00:15:48.796 A:middle

00:15:48.796 --> 00:15:49.896 A:middle
starting this fall.

Apple Watch paired with AirPods

00:16:00.436 --> 00:16:01.656 A:middle

00:16:02.866 --> 00:16:04.296 A:middle
And where redesigning the music

app and watch makes this a

00:16:05.386 --> 00:16:06.576 A:middle
really great experience.

Hey, good morning.

Well, let's talk about macOS.

00:21:35.216 --> 00:21:36.826 A:middle
Now, our current release of

00:21:36.826 --> 00:21:38.736 A:middle

perfecting it.

00:21:59.206 --> 00:22:01.236 A:middle
Of course, the question is, what

do we call it?

00:26:19.916 --> 00:26:21.586 A:middle
categorizing and naming people,

00:26:21.586 --> 00:26:23.106 A:middle
well, that's now synchronized

00:26:23.176 --> 00:26:24.686 A:middle
automatically across all your

00:26:24.686 --> 00:26:24.976 A:middle

[ Applause ]

00:26:30.286 --> 00:26:31.486 A:middle
Now, we also have some great

00:26:31.486 --> 00:26:33.876 A:middle
enhancements to editing inside a

00:26:33.956 --> 00:26:34.246 A:middle
photo.

00:26:34.246 --> 00:26:35.156 A:middle
So you can see here on the

00:26:35.156 --> 00:26:37.446 A:middle
right-hand side, all of your

00:26:37.446 --> 00:26:38.496 A:middle
editing tools array.

00:26:38.496 --> 00:26:39.666 A:middle
And there are bunch of great new

00:26:39.666 --> 00:26:41.826 A:middle
ones, including Curves which

00:26:41.826 --> 00:26:43.636 A:middle
allows you to fine-tune the

00:26:43.636 --> 00:26:45.066 A:middle
color and contrast in your

00:26:45.066 --> 00:26:45.466 A:middle
image.

00:26:45.936 --> 00:26:47.616 A:middle
And Selective Color will teach

00:26:47.616 --> 00:26:49.076 A:middle
you modify color in a selective

00:26:49.076 --> 00:26:49.516 A:middle
range.

00:26:50.046 --> 00:26:50.876 A:middle
And I think you're going to like

00:26:50.876 --> 00:26:52.056 A:middle
this one because if you like to

00:26:52.566 --> 00:26:54.636 A:middle
do edits in a ProTool like

Pixelmator or Photoshop, well

00:26:56.496 --> 00:26:58.276 A:middle
now, when you punch out to that

00:26:58.276 --> 00:26:59.636 A:middle
other editing tool, all of your

00:26:59.636 --> 00:27:01.296 A:middle

00:27:07.666 --> 00:27:10.516 A:middle
Now, Apple pioneered printed

books.

00:27:11.326 --> 00:27:13.216 A:middle
Based on projects, you construct

And now, we're opening this up

00:27:17.866 --> 00:27:19.036 A:middle
to third parties.

00:27:19.456 --> 00:27:20.426 A:middle
They're going to offer some

00:27:20.426 --> 00:27:22.356 A:middle
amazing new printing services,

00:27:31.466 --> 00:27:32.516 A:middle
So those are some quick

00:27:32.516 --> 00:27:33.896 A:middle
refinements but I want to return

00:27:33.896 --> 00:27:36.016 A:middle
to the main story now and that's

00:27:36.016 --> 00:27:37.456 A:middle
technology, this-- because we've

00:27:37.456 --> 00:27:38.946 A:middle
gone deep on the fundamentals,

00:27:39.506 --> 00:27:42.126 A:middle
data, video and graphics.

00:27:42.406 --> 00:27:44.266 A:middle
And when it comes to data, the

00:27:44.366 --> 00:27:46.226 A:middle
fundamentals are in the file

00:27:46.326 --> 00:27:46.736 A:middle
system.

00:27:47.266 --> 00:27:49.096 A:middle
Now, the Mac File System has its

00:27:49.096 --> 00:27:51.916 A:middle
roots actually, HFS from 30

00:27:52.016 --> 00:27:53.466 A:middle
years ago.

00:27:53.746 --> 00:27:55.086 A:middle
Well, a lot has changed since

00:27:55.116 --> 00:27:55.396 A:middle
then.

00:27:55.396 --> 00:27:56.976 A:middle
We have a lot of flash drives or

00:27:56.976 --> 00:27:58.506 A:middle
storage is a billion times

00:27:58.506 --> 00:28:00.646 A:middle
larger and it's time for more

00:28:00.646 --> 00:28:02.046 A:middle
modern file system.

00:28:02.646 --> 00:28:03.776 A:middle

00:28:03.776 --> 00:28:05.326 A:middle
we're bringing the Apple File

00:28:17.536 --> 00:28:17.986 A:middle
bottom.

00:28:18.306 --> 00:28:19.796 A:middle
It's safe and secure with

00:28:19.796 --> 00:28:21.556 A:middle
built-in crash protection and

00:28:21.556 --> 00:28:22.836 A:middle
native encryption.

00:28:23.316 --> 00:28:25.236 A:middle
And it's ultra responsive with

00:28:25.236 --> 00:28:26.826 A:middle
modern features like instant

00:28:26.876 --> 00:28:28.926 A:middle

00:28:32.276 --> 00:28:33.276 A:middle
Now, what does that really mean

00:28:33.276 --> 00:28:34.016 A:middle
in practice?

00:28:34.356 --> 00:28:35.846 A:middle
Well, let's take a look at a

00:28:35.946 --> 00:28:38.076 A:middle
simple file duplication inside

00:28:38.076 --> 00:28:38.896 A:middle

File menu.

00:28:41.276 --> 00:28:42.536 A:middle
It's like duplicate on this very

00:28:42.536 --> 00:28:43.556 A:middle
large video files.

00:28:43.556 --> 00:28:45.106 A:middle
And it's going to copy.

00:28:45.106 --> 00:28:45.826 A:middle
And just like you'd expect,

00:28:45.826 --> 00:28:46.786 A:middle
there's a lot of data to be

00:28:46.786 --> 00:28:48.396 A:middle
copied here so it takes a little

00:28:48.396 --> 00:28:51.326 A:middle
while, just about done, there we

00:28:51.326 --> 00:28:51.616 A:middle
go.

00:28:51.616 --> 00:28:54.006 A:middle
Now, let's watch that in High

Next up, video.

00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:08.936 A:middle
Now, the current standard in

00:29:08.936 --> 00:29:10.416 A:middle
video is H.264.

00:29:10.416 --> 00:29:12.366 A:middle
In fact, H.264 has really

00:29:12.366 --> 00:29:13.386 A:middle
enabled the revolution of

00:29:13.386 --> 00:29:15.266 A:middle
streaming HD video on the

00:29:15.266 --> 00:29:15.726 A:middle
Internet.

00:29:16.226 --> 00:29:17.046 A:middle
But, of course, the game is

00:29:17.046 --> 00:29:21.836 A:middle
moved from HD to 4K and 4K high

00:29:21.836 --> 00:29:23.406 A:middle
dynamic range video.

00:29:23.976 --> 00:29:25.486 A:middle
And there's a new standard to

00:29:25.486 --> 00:29:27.716 A:middle
support this, it's H.265 or

00:29:27.716 --> 00:29:28.096 A:middle
HEVC.

00:29:28.096 --> 00:29:30.566 A:middle
And you want your video to look

00:29:30.566 --> 00:29:32.956 A:middle
great, preserve all the detail

00:29:32.956 --> 00:29:34.946 A:middle
and color, and HEVC does it

00:29:35.606 --> 00:29:38.326 A:middle
while saving up to 40% better

00:29:38.326 --> 00:29:40.166 A:middle
compression than H.264.

00:29:40.166 --> 00:29:41.796 A:middle
Now, we're building in software

00:29:41.796 --> 00:29:42.836 A:middle
encoder support in the High

newest Macs.

00:29:49.446 --> 00:29:50.776 A:middle
And we're also building it into

00:29:50.776 --> 00:29:52.966 A:middle
ProTools, like Final Cut,

00:29:52.966 --> 00:29:54.686 A:middle
Motion, and Compressor.

00:29:55.566 --> 00:29:56.816 A:middle
Now, I want to return to our

00:29:56.816 --> 00:29:59.156 A:middle
main story which is graphics and

00:29:59.156 --> 00:30:01.536 A:middle
graphics are all about the GPU.

00:30:02.086 --> 00:30:03.536 A:middle
The GPU has been the performance

00:30:03.536 --> 00:30:05.766 A:middle
superstar of the last decade

00:30:06.066 --> 00:30:07.656 A:middle

00:30:10.046 --> 00:30:11.406 A:middle
Now, our API for

00:30:11.406 --> 00:30:13.056 A:middle
high-performance graphics is

00:30:13.056 --> 00:30:13.616 A:middle
Metal.

00:30:13.616 --> 00:30:15.016 A:middle
And developers have taken

00:30:15.016 --> 00:30:16.216 A:middle
amazing advantage of Metal.

00:30:20.856 --> 00:30:22.486 A:middle
This is DaVinci Resolve from

00:30:22.486 --> 00:30:24.626 A:middle
Blackmagic which can accelerate

00:30:24.626 --> 00:30:26.276 A:middle
many editing operations.

00:30:26.406 --> 00:30:27.686 A:middle
And, of course, we even use

00:30:27.686 --> 00:30:29.776 A:middle
Metal inside of photos for doing

00:30:29.776 --> 00:30:31.086 A:middle

your photos.

00:30:32.226 --> 00:30:33.846 A:middle
But we've learned a lot working

00:30:33.846 --> 00:30:34.806 A:middle
with developers and their

00:30:34.806 --> 00:30:36.436 A:middle
adoption of Metal and we have a

00:30:36.436 --> 00:30:37.826 A:middle
new version to announce today.

00:30:37.826 --> 00:30:39.186 A:middle
And you'll never guess what we

00:30:39.186 --> 00:30:39.636 A:middle
called it.

00:30:40.496 --> 00:30:40.976 A:middle
It's Metal 2.

[ Laughter ]

00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:45.806 A:middle
Now, Metal 2 is tremendously

00:30:45.806 --> 00:30:46.326 A:middle
fast.

00:30:46.326 --> 00:30:47.596 A:middle
In fact, it has great

00:30:47.596 --> 00:30:49.456 A:middle
optimizations and new APIs that

00:30:49.456 --> 00:30:52.146 A:middle
when adopted, deliver another 10

00:30:52.146 --> 00:30:54.076 A:middle
times improvement in draw call

00:30:54.076 --> 00:30:54.676 A:middle
throughput.

00:30:54.846 --> 00:30:55.726 A:middle
Now, some of you remember when

00:30:55.726 --> 00:30:57.466 A:middle
Metal first came out, it itself

00:30:57.466 --> 00:30:58.746 A:middle
had a 10 times improvement over

00:30:58.746 --> 00:30:59.286 A:middle
OpenGL.

00:30:59.566 --> 00:31:00.736 A:middle
You can multiply those numbers

00:31:00.736 --> 00:31:01.096 A:middle
together.

00:31:01.096 --> 00:31:02.396 A:middle
That's a hundred times

00:31:02.396 --> 00:31:03.016 A:middle
improvement.

00:31:03.446 --> 00:31:05.216 A:middle
Now, we've also provided

00:31:05.416 --> 00:31:09.366 A:middle
better-- sorry, debugging and

00:31:09.416 --> 00:31:11.066 A:middle
performance analysis tools for

00:31:11.066 --> 00:31:12.096 A:middle
you to optimize your app for

00:31:12.096 --> 00:31:12.406 A:middle
Metal.

00:31:12.406 --> 00:31:14.176 A:middle
And we're so excited about the

00:31:14.176 --> 00:31:16.086 A:middle
advances in Metal 2 that we've

00:31:16.086 --> 00:31:18.326 A:middle
taken the Mac Window Server and

00:31:18.326 --> 00:31:19.796 A:middle
put it on top of Metal,

00:31:19.796 --> 00:31:21.666 A:middle
accelerating things like Mission

00:31:21.666 --> 00:31:22.296 A:middle
Control.

00:31:22.296 --> 00:31:23.616 A:middle
And some of our most challenging

00:31:23.616 --> 00:31:24.846 A:middle
system animations are now

00:31:24.966 --> 00:31:27.026 A:middle
buttery smooth all the time.

00:31:27.456 --> 00:31:29.546 A:middle
Now, Metal is not just about

00:31:29.546 --> 00:31:30.146 A:middle
graphics.

00:31:30.146 --> 00:31:32.246 A:middle
We're also using it for machine

00:31:32.246 --> 00:31:32.836 A:middle
learning.

00:31:32.836 --> 00:31:34.946 A:middle
It can now accelerate-- yes, we

00:31:34.946 --> 00:31:36.636 A:middle
have Metal performance shaders

00:31:36.856 --> 00:31:38.836 A:middle
to accelerate all kinds of deep

00:31:38.836 --> 00:31:39.916 A:middle
learning algorithms.

00:31:40.766 --> 00:31:41.866 A:middle
Another piece of Metal news

00:31:41.916 --> 00:31:44.216 A:middle
today is Metal for external

00:31:44.216 --> 00:31:44.936 A:middle
graphics.

00:31:45.966 --> 00:31:48.266 A:middle
So, you know our MacBooks have

00:31:48.266 --> 00:31:50.146 A:middle
this tremendous balance of

00:31:50.196 --> 00:31:52.026 A:middle
portability and power.

00:31:52.846 --> 00:31:54.106 A:middle
But sometimes for some

00:31:54.106 --> 00:31:56.006 A:middle
workflows, you need even more

00:31:56.006 --> 00:31:56.246 A:middle
power.

00:31:56.246 --> 00:31:57.706 A:middle
You want to take advantage of

00:31:57.706 --> 00:32:00.366 A:middle
the incredible Thunderbolt IO on

00:32:00.366 --> 00:32:02.556 A:middle
your MacBook Pros to access

00:32:02.556 --> 00:32:04.046 A:middle
external graphics.

00:32:04.996 --> 00:32:05.966 A:middle
So we're going to be making this

00:32:05.996 --> 00:32:07.186 A:middle
possible in Metal 2.

00:32:07.606 --> 00:32:09.416 A:middle
Now, we're starting with the

00:32:09.416 --> 00:32:10.376 A:middle
Developer Kit that will be

00:32:10.376 --> 00:32:11.316 A:middle
available today.

00:32:11.316 --> 00:32:13.296 A:middle
You can actually order a

00:32:13.296 --> 00:32:14.746 A:middle
Thunderbolt 3 enclosure with a

00:32:14.746 --> 00:32:17.956 A:middle
high-performance AMD GPU and

00:32:17.956 --> 00:32:19.616 A:middle
tune your apps for

00:32:19.616 --> 00:32:20.866 A:middle
high-performance external

00:32:20.866 --> 00:32:21.356 A:middle
graphics.

00:32:21.496 --> 00:32:22.766 A:middle
And then we'll be rolling out

00:32:22.816 --> 00:32:24.716 A:middle
support to all of our customers

00:32:25.116 --> 00:32:26.046 A:middle
in the months to come.

00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:29.216 A:middle
Now, with these graphics power,

00:32:29.486 --> 00:32:30.716 A:middle
we're really doubling down on

00:32:30.716 --> 00:32:31.996 A:middle
our focus on Pro content

00:32:31.996 --> 00:32:32.536 A:middle
creation.

00:32:33.136 --> 00:32:34.756 A:middle
And that's increasingly about VR

00:32:34.756 --> 00:32:36.896 A:middle
content creation.

00:32:37.406 --> 00:32:40.666 A:middle
And so, we're bringing Metal for

00:32:41.006 --> 00:32:41.766 A:middle
VR to High Sierra.

00:32:42.516 --> 00:32:46.096 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:46.596 --> 00:32:47.686 A:middle
Now Metal is delivering a

00:32:47.806 --> 00:32:50.526 A:middle
VR-optimized display pipeline

00:32:50.526 --> 00:32:51.806 A:middle
that provides extremely high

00:32:51.806 --> 00:32:52.626 A:middle
performance.

00:32:53.166 --> 00:32:55.196 A:middle
And we're optimizing our Pro

00:32:55.196 --> 00:32:56.406 A:middle
apps like Final Cut for doing

00:32:56.406 --> 00:32:57.536 A:middle
things like editing spherical

00:32:57.536 --> 00:32:59.136 A:middle
video right inside the VR

00:32:59.136 --> 00:32:59.626 A:middle
environment.

00:33:00.176 --> 00:33:01.946 A:middle
We're also working with Valve.

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:03.476 A:middle
They're bringing the SteamVR,

00:33:03.476 --> 00:33:04.236 A:middle
SVK to the Mac.

00:33:04.886 --> 00:33:07.896 A:middle
And we work with Unity and

00:33:07.896 --> 00:33:09.676 A:middle
Unreal to bring their engines

00:33:09.916 --> 00:33:11.276 A:middle
for VR to the Mac.

00:33:12.516 --> 00:33:16.396 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:33:16.896 --> 00:33:18.086 A:middle
It's really cool and you might

00:33:18.126 --> 00:33:19.356 A:middle
just be seeing a little bit more

00:33:19.356 --> 00:33:20.796 A:middle
from us later today on this

00:33:20.796 --> 00:33:21.266 A:middle
topic.

00:33:21.686 --> 00:33:24.146 A:middle
So that's a quick look at macOS.

00:33:24.176 --> 00:33:25.926 A:middle
Some great technologies with the

00:33:25.926 --> 00:33:28.956 A:middle
Apple File System, HEVC Video

00:33:29.046 --> 00:33:30.966 A:middle
and incredible graphics with

00:33:30.966 --> 00:33:33.306 A:middle
Metal 2 support for external

00:33:33.306 --> 00:33:35.286 A:middle
graphics and VR support of the

00:33:35.286 --> 00:33:37.436 A:middle
Mac and, of course, a bunch of

00:33:37.496 --> 00:33:38.886 A:middle
fantastic refinements.

00:33:39.306 --> 00:33:41.176 A:middle
Now, macOS High Sierra is

00:33:41.176 --> 00:33:43.646 A:middle
available for all of you today

00:33:43.646 --> 00:33:44.686 A:middle
as a developer beta.

00:33:44.686 --> 00:33:46.526 A:middle
And if you sign up at

00:33:46.526 --> 00:33:48.896 A:middle
beta.apple.com, we'll also have

00:33:48.896 --> 00:33:50.816 A:middle
a public beta available later at

00:33:50.816 --> 00:33:52.276 A:middle
this month and, of course, it's

00:33:52.276 --> 00:33:53.906 A:middle
shipping to everyone as a free

00:33:53.906 --> 00:33:56.556 A:middle
upgrade this fall on all systems

00:33:56.646 --> 00:33:57.706 A:middle
that support Sierra.

00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:00.586 A:middle
Now, that's your update on macOS

00:34:00.586 --> 00:34:01.676 A:middle
High Sierra and I'm going to

00:34:01.676 --> 00:34:03.006 A:middle
turn it over to our vice

00:34:03.066 --> 00:34:04.006 A:middle
president of Hardware

00:34:04.006 --> 00:34:05.496 A:middle
Engineering, John Ternus, to

00:34:05.496 --> 00:34:06.906 A:middle
tell you more about the Mac.

00:34:07.186 --> 00:34:07.546 A:middle
Thank you.

[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:34:15.536 --> 00:34:16.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Craig.

00:34:17.616 --> 00:34:19.686 A:middle
So, we have some great updates

00:34:19.726 --> 00:34:21.176 A:middle
to talk about today that span

00:34:21.176 --> 00:34:22.666 A:middle
much of the Mac product line.

00:34:23.036 --> 00:34:24.346 A:middle
And let's begin with the iMac.

00:34:25.636 --> 00:34:27.246 A:middle
Now, the iMac has been the gold

00:34:27.246 --> 00:34:28.786 A:middle
standard of desktops for many

00:34:28.786 --> 00:34:30.076 A:middle
years but we're going to raise

00:34:30.076 --> 00:34:31.316 A:middle
the bar once again.

00:34:31.816 --> 00:34:33.316 A:middle
And as always on the iMac, it

00:34:33.316 --> 00:34:34.496 A:middle
starts with the display.

00:34:35.486 --> 00:34:37.276 A:middle
Because the 4K and 5K Retina

00:34:37.456 --> 00:34:38.836 A:middle
iMac displays with their high

00:34:38.836 --> 00:34:40.626 A:middle
resolution, excellent brightness

00:34:40.786 --> 00:34:42.796 A:middle
and P3 color gamut, are the best

00:34:42.796 --> 00:34:44.286 A:middle
displays on any desktop.

00:34:44.286 --> 00:34:45.706 A:middle
But we're going to make them

00:34:45.706 --> 00:34:46.276 A:middle
even better.

00:34:46.986 --> 00:34:48.776 A:middle
So these new displays are now

00:34:48.776 --> 00:34:50.336 A:middle
going to be 500 nits.

00:34:50.376 --> 00:34:52.276 A:middle
That's 43% brighter than the

00:34:52.276 --> 00:34:53.196 A:middle
previous generation.

00:34:53.806 --> 00:34:55.456 A:middle
And for the first time, we're

00:34:55.456 --> 00:34:56.546 A:middle
going to support 10-bit

00:34:56.546 --> 00:34:57.856 A:middle
dithering, which means these

00:34:57.856 --> 00:34:59.206 A:middle
displays can reproduce up to a

00:34:59.206 --> 00:35:00.416 A:middle
billion colors.

00:35:01.586 --> 00:35:02.776 A:middle
So, your content is going to

00:35:02.776 --> 00:35:04.236 A:middle
look more true to life than ever

00:35:04.236 --> 00:35:04.666 A:middle
before.

00:35:05.566 --> 00:35:06.976 A:middle
Now, in addition, we've got some

00:35:06.976 --> 00:35:08.456 A:middle
great internal updates for these

00:35:08.546 --> 00:35:08.906 A:middle
iMacs.

00:35:09.286 --> 00:35:10.496 A:middle
So we'll start with the CPU

00:35:10.496 --> 00:35:11.826 A:middle
because the whole line is moving

00:35:11.826 --> 00:35:13.666 A:middle
to Intel's 7th-generation Core

00:35:13.666 --> 00:35:15.546 A:middle
Processor, also known as Kaby

00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:15.776 A:middle
Lake.

00:35:16.166 --> 00:35:17.486 A:middle
Now, Kaby Lake gets this better

00:35:17.486 --> 00:35:19.216 A:middle
base and turbo frequencies for

00:35:19.216 --> 00:35:20.856 A:middle
more performance as well as

00:35:20.856 --> 00:35:23.166 A:middle
hardware-based 10-bit HEVC

00:35:23.166 --> 00:35:24.586 A:middle
decode which is great for

00:35:24.586 --> 00:35:25.966 A:middle
playing back high quality video.

00:35:27.016 --> 00:35:28.316 A:middle
In addition, these iMacs are

00:35:28.316 --> 00:35:29.396 A:middle
getting a boost when it comes to

00:35:29.396 --> 00:35:30.366 A:middle
memory capacity.

00:35:30.766 --> 00:35:32.996 A:middle
So the 21.5-inch systems can now

00:35:32.996 --> 00:35:34.766 A:middle
be configured with up to 32 gigs

00:35:34.766 --> 00:35:35.236 A:middle
of memory.

00:35:35.576 --> 00:35:37.176 A:middle
And the 27-inch can go all the

00:35:37.176 --> 00:35:38.566 A:middle
way up to 64 gigabytes of

00:35:38.566 --> 00:35:38.936 A:middle
memory.

00:35:39.216 --> 00:35:40.446 A:middle
Both of those are twice what the

00:35:40.446 --> 00:35:41.656 A:middle
previous generation can do.

00:35:42.976 --> 00:35:44.466 A:middle
Now, fast storage has always

00:35:44.516 --> 00:35:45.986 A:middle
been a key part of the iMac.

00:35:45.986 --> 00:35:47.076 A:middle
And so, we're going to now make

00:35:47.076 --> 00:35:49.166 A:middle
our Fusion Drive standard on all

00:35:49.166 --> 00:35:50.276 A:middle
27-inch configs.

00:35:50.276 --> 00:35:51.606 A:middle
And it's also going to be

00:35:51.606 --> 00:35:52.806 A:middle
standard on the high-end

00:35:52.806 --> 00:35:54.566 A:middle
21.5-inch config as well.

00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:57.366 A:middle
In addition, our SSD options are

00:35:57.366 --> 00:35:59.426 A:middle
going to be up to 50% faster and

00:35:59.426 --> 00:36:01.336 A:middle
now available up to 2 terabytes.

00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:04.426 A:middle
And the iMacs are getting an IO

00:36:04.426 --> 00:36:05.436 A:middle
upgrade as well because we're

00:36:05.436 --> 00:36:07.706 A:middle
giving them two USB-C connectors

00:36:07.746 --> 00:36:09.246 A:middle
which support Thunderbolt 3.

00:36:09.466 --> 00:36:10.636 A:middle
And we think our customers

00:36:10.636 --> 00:36:12.106 A:middle
especially our Pro users are

00:36:12.156 --> 00:36:12.936 A:middle
really going to love this

00:36:12.936 --> 00:36:13.926 A:middle
because you can do some cool

00:36:13.996 --> 00:36:15.246 A:middle
things like hook up a

00:36:15.246 --> 00:36:16.966 A:middle
high-performance RAID array and

00:36:16.966 --> 00:36:18.866 A:middle
an external 5K display at the

00:36:18.966 --> 00:36:20.126 A:middle
same time.

00:36:20.656 --> 00:36:21.966 A:middle
So now, let's talk about

00:36:21.966 --> 00:36:22.496 A:middle
graphics.

00:36:22.496 --> 00:36:23.906 A:middle
And as you heard earlier, we're

00:36:23.906 --> 00:36:25.386 A:middle
investing heavily in graphic

00:36:25.386 --> 00:36:26.976 A:middle
software technologies like Metal

00:36:27.086 --> 00:36:27.426 A:middle
2.

00:36:27.426 --> 00:36:29.206 A:middle
Well, we're also investing in

00:36:29.206 --> 00:36:30.166 A:middle
graphics hardware.

00:36:30.166 --> 00:36:31.926 A:middle
And every configuration in this

00:36:31.926 --> 00:36:33.236 A:middle
new iMac line is going to get a

00:36:33.236 --> 00:36:35.066 A:middle
big bump in its graphics

00:36:35.066 --> 00:36:35.706 A:middle
performance.

00:36:36.346 --> 00:36:37.096 A:middle
So we'll start with the

00:36:37.096 --> 00:36:37.906 A:middle
entry-level iMac.

00:36:38.186 --> 00:36:39.496 A:middle
Now this system gets a boost in

00:36:39.496 --> 00:36:41.386 A:middle
its integrated GPU by way of

00:36:41.386 --> 00:36:43.206 A:middle
Intel's Iris Plus Graphics which

00:36:43.206 --> 00:36:45.166 A:middle
now has 64 megabytes of eDRAM.

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:46.626 A:middle
And the performance that we're

00:36:46.626 --> 00:36:47.546 A:middle
getting out of this is pretty

00:36:47.546 --> 00:36:49.096 A:middle
amazing because this system is

00:36:49.096 --> 00:36:51.196 A:middle
up to 80% faster in graphics

00:36:51.196 --> 00:36:51.946 A:middle
than the previous generation.

00:36:52.516 --> 00:36:56.306 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:36:56.806 --> 00:36:59.296 A:middle
Now next up is the 21.5-inch

00:36:59.436 --> 00:37:01.296 A:middle
iMac with Retina 4K display.

00:37:01.296 --> 00:37:02.936 A:middle
And the big news here is that

00:37:02.936 --> 00:37:04.056 A:middle
we're going to be moving to

00:37:04.056 --> 00:37:05.516 A:middle
discrete graphics and making it

00:37:05.516 --> 00:37:07.636 A:middle
standard on all 4K iMacs.

00:37:07.926 --> 00:37:09.376 A:middle
And that's going to come-- There

00:37:09.376 --> 00:37:09.576 A:middle
you go.

00:37:09.576 --> 00:37:10.936 A:middle
And that's going to come in this

00:37:10.936 --> 00:37:13.356 A:middle
Radeon Pro series GPUs with up

00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:15.026 A:middle
to 4 gigabytes of VRAM.

00:37:15.656 --> 00:37:17.106 A:middle
And again, this move to discrete

00:37:17.106 --> 00:37:18.046 A:middle
graphics yield to pretty

00:37:18.046 --> 00:37:19.576 A:middle
spectacular performance increase

00:37:19.966 --> 00:37:21.616 A:middle
because this new system is up to

00:37:21.616 --> 00:37:23.256 A:middle
three times faster than the

00:37:23.256 --> 00:37:24.286 A:middle
previous generation for

00:37:24.286 --> 00:37:24.956 A:middle
graphics.

00:37:25.516 --> 00:37:28.726 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:37:29.226 --> 00:37:31.366 A:middle
Now, lastly, we have our 27-inch

00:37:31.446 --> 00:37:31.716 A:middle
iMAc.

00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:32.936 A:middle
And this is our most popular

00:37:32.936 --> 00:37:34.626 A:middle
desktop for our Pro customers.

00:37:34.926 --> 00:37:36.206 A:middle
So obviously, it's going to get

00:37:36.206 --> 00:37:37.346 A:middle
a bump in graphics today as

00:37:37.346 --> 00:37:37.656 A:middle
well.

00:37:38.036 --> 00:37:38.996 A:middle
So it's going to have this

00:37:38.996 --> 00:37:41.566 A:middle
Radeon Pro 500 series GPUs with

00:37:41.566 --> 00:37:43.246 A:middle
up to 8 gigabytes of VRAM.

00:37:44.076 --> 00:37:45.186 A:middle
And again, we get a great

00:37:45.186 --> 00:37:45.976 A:middle
performance uplift.

00:37:45.976 --> 00:37:47.686 A:middle
In fact, this 27-inch iMac can

Now, I've always done my art and

00:39:01.536 --> 00:39:04.186 A:middle
Working together, we can work in

On my left motion controller, I

00:39:34.466 --> 00:39:35.786 A:middle
have my Radial Menu, which

00:39:35.786 --> 00:39:37.036 A:middle
accesses my artist palette.

00:39:37.666 --> 00:39:38.956 A:middle
Now on the right, I have the

We've actually set up the smart

00:40:01.166 --> 00:40:02.386 A:middle

00:40:02.386 --> 00:40:03.136 A:middle
where to come in for their

up.

00:44:08.076 --> 00:44:09.276 A:middle
So a great performance bump

00:44:09.416 --> 00:44:10.126 A:middle
across the board.

00:44:11.216 --> 00:44:12.166 A:middle
So here is that lineup.

00:44:12.286 --> 00:44:13.156 A:middle
But just like the iMac, we're

00:44:13.356 --> 00:44:14.656 A:middle
going to bring more value here

00:44:14.656 --> 00:44:16.056 A:middle
as well because we're going to

00:44:16.056 --> 00:44:17.466 A:middle
have a new configuration of the

00:44:17.536 --> 00:44:19.516 A:middle
13-inch MacBook Pro that also

00:44:19.516 --> 00:44:21.686 A:middle
starts at just $1299.

00:44:27.386 --> 00:44:28.156 A:middle
So there you'd have it.

00:44:28.436 --> 00:44:30.276 A:middle
We've updated seven of our most

00:44:30.336 --> 00:44:32.686 A:middle
popular Macs and the MacBook Air

00:44:32.686 --> 00:44:33.956 A:middle
is going to get a bump in

00:44:33.956 --> 00:44:34.976 A:middle
megahertz as well.

00:44:34.976 --> 00:44:36.896 A:middle
And even better, they're all

[ Applause ]

00:44:43.486 --> 00:44:45.186 A:middle
Now, we care deeply about the

00:44:45.186 --> 00:44:45.716 A:middle
environment.

00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:47.026 A:middle
And so as with all our products,

00:44:47.026 --> 00:44:48.346 A:middle
we've been working really hard

00:44:48.346 --> 00:44:49.646 A:middle
to ensure that these new Macs

00:44:49.926 --> 00:44:51.296 A:middle
are free of harmful chemicals,

00:44:51.626 --> 00:44:53.746 A:middle
very energy efficient and highly

00:44:53.746 --> 00:44:54.296 A:middle
recyclable.

00:44:54.866 --> 00:44:56.846 A:middle
So that's everything we're

00:44:56.886 --> 00:44:57.666 A:middle
updating today.

00:44:58.176 --> 00:44:59.536 A:middle
But, it's not actually

00:44:59.536 --> 00:45:00.586 A:middle
everything we want to show you

00:45:00.586 --> 00:45:00.736 A:middle
today.

00:45:00.736 --> 00:45:03.596 A:middle
Now the iMac line has incredible

00:45:03.706 --> 00:45:04.026 A:middle
breadth.

00:45:04.146 --> 00:45:05.596 A:middle
It spans from an entry level

00:45:05.596 --> 00:45:06.986 A:middle
system that's perfect for use at

00:45:06.986 --> 00:45:08.856 A:middle
home or in a school, all the way

00:45:08.856 --> 00:45:09.876 A:middle
up through that powerhouse

00:45:09.876 --> 00:45:11.656 A:middle
27-inch model which allows

00:45:11.656 --> 00:45:13.226 A:middle
professional customers to create

00:45:13.226 --> 00:45:15.126 A:middle
amazing things every day.

00:45:16.256 --> 00:45:17.686 A:middle
But that said, there's another

00:45:17.686 --> 00:45:19.376 A:middle
class of Pro users who would

00:45:19.376 --> 00:45:20.306 A:middle
love to be able to take

00:45:20.306 --> 00:45:21.936 A:middle
advantage of the iMac's display

00:45:21.936 --> 00:45:23.446 A:middle
and design, but they need

00:45:23.446 --> 00:45:25.056 A:middle
workstation class performance

00:45:25.056 --> 00:45:26.446 A:middle
that can't possibly fit into an

00:45:26.446 --> 00:45:27.056 A:middle
all-in-one.

00:45:27.746 --> 00:45:29.146 A:middle
Well, we wanted to challenge

00:45:29.146 --> 00:45:30.216 A:middle
that assumption, and so we've

00:45:30.216 --> 00:45:31.636 A:middle
been working really hard to see

00:45:31.706 --> 00:45:33.426 A:middle
just how far we can push the

00:45:33.426 --> 00:45:33.696 A:middle
iMac.

00:45:34.676 --> 00:45:35.566 A:middle
Now, this isn't going to be

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:36.676 A:middle
shipping until the end of the

00:45:36.676 --> 00:45:38.356 A:middle
year but I'm really excited to

00:45:38.356 --> 00:45:39.936 A:middle
be able to give you a sneak peek

00:45:39.936 --> 00:45:41.336 A:middle
of what we've been up to, and

00:45:41.336 --> 00:45:43.886 A:middle
here it is.

Cool. So that is the new iMac

00:46:15.746 --> 00:46:16.546 A:middle
Now, the first thing you'll

00:46:16.546 --> 00:46:17.976 A:middle
notice, it features the same

00:46:17.976 --> 00:46:20.346 A:middle
great design as our 27-inch iMac

00:46:21.186 --> 00:46:22.286 A:middle
but it's in this seriously

00:46:22.286 --> 00:46:23.956 A:middle
badass space gray finish.

00:46:25.656 --> 00:46:27.216 A:middle
And with that stunning new color

00:46:27.216 --> 00:46:28.936 A:middle
and gorgeous 5K display, this is

00:46:28.936 --> 00:46:30.016 A:middle
without a doubt the most

00:46:30.076 --> 00:46:31.826 A:middle
beautiful iMac we've ever made.

00:46:32.316 --> 00:46:34.646 A:middle
But it's also going to be by far

00:46:34.736 --> 00:46:36.336 A:middle
the most powerful iMac we've

00:46:36.336 --> 00:46:36.776 A:middle
ever made.

00:46:37.276 --> 00:46:39.186 A:middle

powerful Mac we've ever made

[ Applause ]

00:46:45.866 --> 00:46:47.376 A:middle
Because we actually are going to

00:46:47.586 --> 00:46:49.006 A:middle
put workstation class

00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:50.586 A:middle

00:46:50.586 --> 00:46:51.996 A:middle
5K iMac design.

00:46:52.526 --> 00:46:53.916 A:middle
Now to do that, the team had to

00:46:53.916 --> 00:46:55.456 A:middle
completely rethink the thermal

00:46:55.456 --> 00:46:57.296 A:middle
architecture, and they came up

00:46:57.326 --> 00:46:58.916 A:middle
with this really efficient dual

00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:00.836 A:middle
centrifugal fan solution which

00:47:00.836 --> 00:47:02.586 A:middle
generates significantly more

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:03.996 A:middle
airflow than a traditional iMac.

00:47:04.436 --> 00:47:05.686 A:middle
In fact, the iMac Pro has a

00:47:05.686 --> 00:47:07.606 A:middle
greater than 80% increase in

00:47:07.606 --> 00:47:08.526 A:middle
cooling capacity.

00:47:08.976 --> 00:47:10.096 A:middle

00:47:10.096 --> 00:47:11.866 A:middle
unbelievable performance while

00:47:11.866 --> 00:47:13.116 A:middle
still maintaining the quiet

00:47:15.516 --> 00:47:16.476 A:middle
So let's talk about what's

00:47:16.476 --> 00:47:17.686 A:middle
inside and I want to start with

00:47:17.686 --> 00:47:19.036 A:middle
the CPU because we wanted to go

00:47:19.106 --> 00:47:19.976 A:middle
really big here.

00:47:20.346 --> 00:47:22.416 A:middle

That is a ton of compute power.

00:47:47.876 --> 00:47:49.026 A:middle
But we didn't want to stop there

00:47:49.026 --> 00:47:50.026 A:middle
because we wanted to go really

00:47:50.026 --> 00:47:51.476 A:middle
big on graphics as well.

00:47:51.936 --> 00:47:54.216 A:middle
So the iMac Pro is going to use

00:47:54.216 --> 00:47:55.756 A:middle
AMD's Radeon Vega graphics.

00:47:55.756 --> 00:47:57.796 A:middle

00:48:03.916 --> 00:48:05.856 A:middle
It's going to be available with

00:48:05.856 --> 00:48:08.236 A:middle
up to 16 gigabytes of VRAM and

00:48:08.236 --> 00:48:10.476 A:middle
over 400 gigabytes per second of

00:48:11.246 --> 00:48:12.596 A:middle

entry level configuration here

00:48:14.386 --> 00:48:15.836 A:middle
because our implementation is

00:48:15.836 --> 00:48:16.986 A:middle
going to offer up to 11

00:48:16.986 --> 00:48:18.706 A:middle
teraflops of single precision

00:48:18.706 --> 00:48:19.396 A:middle
compute power.

00:48:19.876 --> 00:48:21.256 A:middle
That's three times more than the

00:48:21.256 --> 00:48:22.936 A:middle
best GPU in the Mac Pro.

00:48:22.936 --> 00:48:24.786 A:middle
But it actually gets even better

00:48:25.016 --> 00:48:26.676 A:middle
because this Radeon Vega GPU can

00:48:26.676 --> 00:48:28.526 A:middle
also do half precision compute.

00:48:28.876 --> 00:48:30.276 A:middle
So that means the iMac Pro can

00:48:30.276 --> 00:48:33.536 A:middle
deliver up to 22 teraflops of

00:48:33.536 --> 00:48:34.956 A:middle
half precision computation.

00:48:36.466 --> 00:48:37.886 A:middle
This is a really big deal for

00:48:37.886 --> 00:48:39.086 A:middle
things like machine learning

00:48:40.126 --> 00:48:41.526 A:middle
So the iMac Pro as you can see

00:48:41.526 --> 00:48:42.786 A:middle
is going to be a monster when it

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:44.346 A:middle
comes to graphics, but we didn't

00:48:44.346 --> 00:48:45.366 A:middle
want to stop there either.

00:48:45.696 --> 00:48:46.396 A:middle
So we're going to let you

00:48:46.396 --> 00:48:48.376 A:middle
configure it with up to 128

gigabytes of ECC memory.

00:48:50.426 --> 00:48:51.806 A:middle
That's twice what you can do on

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:05.226 A:middle
Now, the iMac Pro is also going

00:49:05.226 --> 00:49:06.466 A:middle
to have a full complement of

I/O, you can do some pretty

00:49:22.056 --> 00:49:22.786 A:middle
amazing things.

00:49:22.786 --> 00:49:24.846 A:middle
So you can hook up two 5K

displays in two high-performance

00:49:26.566 --> 00:49:28.216 A:middle

could ever do that.

00:49:29.286 --> 00:49:30.316 A:middle
And when you combine that with

00:49:30.316 --> 00:49:32.096 A:middle
the internal display, that means

00:49:32.096 --> 00:49:34.896 A:middle
the iMac Pro can drive up to 44

00:49:34.896 --> 00:49:35.826 A:middle
million pixels.

00:49:37.236 --> 00:49:38.026 A:middle
There's so much more.

00:49:38.026 --> 00:49:38.856 A:middle
We don't even have time to get

00:49:38.856 --> 00:49:40.566 A:middle
into things like a 1080p

configurable VESA mount option,

two times wider AVX instructions

00:49:45.956 --> 00:49:48.536 A:middle
and even a UHS-II SD card slot.

00:49:49.216 --> 00:49:50.216 A:middle
So with all these

00:49:50.216 --> 00:49:51.496 A:middle
high-performance technologies

00:49:51.496 --> 00:49:53.326 A:middle
and our incredible 5K display,

00:49:53.586 --> 00:49:55.016 A:middle
this iMac Pro is going to be an

00:49:55.016 --> 00:49:56.476 A:middle
awesome workstation for things

00:49:56.476 --> 00:49:58.286 A:middle
like real-time 3D rendering,

machine learning development,

00:50:01.706 --> 00:50:03.506 A:middle
and with all those cores and all

00:50:03.506 --> 00:50:05.216 A:middle
that memory, super fast code

00:50:05.216 --> 00:50:05.616 A:middle
compiling.

00:50:07.126 --> 00:50:08.826 A:middle
Now speaking of workstations, we

00:50:08.826 --> 00:50:10.226 A:middle
wanted to compare the starting

00:50:10.226 --> 00:50:12.076 A:middle
configuration of the iMac Pro to

00:50:12.076 --> 00:50:12.956 A:middle
what's on the market.

00:50:13.476 --> 00:50:14.636 A:middle
And so, if you were to go out

00:50:14.636 --> 00:50:16.156 A:middle
and build a comparably spec

00:50:16.226 --> 00:50:18.496 A:middle
system today, it will cost over

Let's talk about iOS 11.

It's a big one.

00:52:48.606 --> 00:52:50.246 A:middle
Now, we have a big focus on

00:52:50.246 --> 00:52:52.866 A:middle
technologies in iOS 11 but also

00:52:52.866 --> 00:52:54.436 A:middle
some really big features.

We have a lot to talk about.

00:52:56.516 --> 00:52:57.956 A:middle
We're going to start with

Messages.

00:52:59.186 --> 00:53:01.446 A:middle
Now, you all know in iOS 10, we

00:53:01.446 --> 00:53:04.676 A:middle
had iMessage apps and stickers.

00:53:05.176 --> 00:53:06.366 A:middle
People had a lot of fun with

00:53:06.366 --> 00:53:06.726 A:middle
these.

00:53:06.726 --> 00:53:08.386 A:middle
And now in iOS 11, we're making

00:53:08.386 --> 00:53:09.766 A:middle
them more discoverable and ever

00:53:09.766 --> 00:53:11.556 A:middle
with this redesigned app drawer.

You can see you have your apps

accessible right there at the

00:53:14.056 --> 00:53:15.266 A:middle
bottom of the screen with just a

00:53:15.266 --> 00:53:16.836 A:middle

though is messages in iCloud.

Because now with your iMessages

to optimize your device storage

00:53:55.446 --> 00:53:56.466 A:middle
because with your messages in

00:56:52.936 --> 00:56:54.506 A:middle
restaurant in Chinese?

00:56:54.606 --> 00:56:55.976 A:middle
And Siri can say,

[ Foreign Language ]

00:56:59.146 --> 00:56:59.626 A:middle
Totally.

[ Applause ]

00:57:06.396 --> 00:57:07.756 A:middle
Now, translation initially will

00:57:07.756 --> 00:57:09.066 A:middle
support translation from English

00:57:09.166 --> 00:57:11.056 A:middle
to Chinese, French, German,

00:57:11.116 --> 00:57:12.926 A:middle
Italian, and Spanish and we'll

00:57:12.926 --> 00:57:14.596 A:middle
have more language combinations

00:57:14.596 --> 00:57:16.166 A:middle
coming in the months to come.

00:57:16.796 --> 00:57:18.436 A:middle
Now, when it comes to using Siri

00:57:18.436 --> 00:57:19.656 A:middle
to access your other

00:57:19.656 --> 00:57:21.636 A:middle
applications, we have SiriKit.

00:57:21.636 --> 00:57:23.636 A:middle
And SiriKit can now do more than

00:57:23.676 --> 00:57:25.866 A:middle
ever in iOS 11.

00:57:26.356 --> 00:57:27.966 A:middle
So now, you can do task

00:57:28.196 --> 00:57:30.246 A:middle
management by using Siri to make

00:57:30.246 --> 00:57:32.576 A:middle
tasks and OmniFocus your things,

00:57:32.846 --> 00:57:34.396 A:middle
take notes in Evernote, do

00:57:34.396 --> 00:57:36.006 A:middle
banking in Citi Mobile or even

00:57:36.006 --> 00:57:38.766 A:middle
bring up a QR code in WeChat.

00:57:39.096 --> 00:57:40.426 A:middle
Now, Siri isn't just a voice

00:57:40.426 --> 00:57:41.746 A:middle
assistant, because with Siri

00:57:41.746 --> 00:57:43.636 A:middle
Intelligence, Siri not only

00:57:43.636 --> 00:57:45.086 A:middle
understands your voice, it

00:57:45.086 --> 00:57:46.796 A:middle
understands the context.

00:57:47.116 --> 00:57:49.006 A:middle
It understands your interest.

00:57:49.236 --> 00:57:50.426 A:middle
It understands how you use your

00:57:50.426 --> 00:57:50.906 A:middle
device.

00:57:50.906 --> 00:57:53.146 A:middle
And this allows it to ultimately

00:57:53.146 --> 00:57:55.296 A:middle
understand what you want next.

00:57:55.886 --> 00:57:57.726 A:middle
Now, we've all experienced this

00:57:57.726 --> 00:57:58.926 A:middle
where Siri can help us predict

00:57:59.306 --> 00:58:00.746 A:middle
what apps we might want to use

00:58:00.746 --> 00:58:03.136 A:middle
next, give us a time to leave

00:58:04.316 --> 00:58:06.976 A:middle
calendar and where we are, help

00:58:06.976 --> 00:58:08.456 A:middle
us respond to a text message.

00:58:08.976 --> 00:58:11.636 A:middle
In iOS 11, Siri uses on-device

00:58:11.636 --> 00:58:13.096 A:middle
learning to understand more

00:58:13.096 --> 00:58:14.816 A:middle
about topics of interest to us.

00:58:15.266 --> 00:58:16.636 A:middle
So it can actually suggest

00:58:16.636 --> 00:58:18.626 A:middle
topics we might be interested in

00:58:18.626 --> 00:58:19.716 A:middle
learning about in news.

00:58:19.716 --> 00:58:22.116 A:middle
It can help us respond with our

00:58:22.116 --> 00:58:23.396 A:middle
location for getting to an

00:58:23.396 --> 00:58:25.046 A:middle
appointment to someone in

00:58:25.046 --> 00:58:25.686 A:middle
messages.

00:58:26.016 --> 00:58:27.576 A:middle
And even help us make a calendar

00:58:27.576 --> 00:58:28.646 A:middle
appointment based on something

00:58:28.646 --> 00:58:29.896 A:middle
we've just booked inside of

00:58:29.896 --> 00:58:30.906 A:middle
Safari on the web.

00:58:30.906 --> 00:58:32.936 A:middle
And what Siri learns about you

00:58:32.936 --> 00:58:35.246 A:middle
on device is now kept synced

00:58:35.246 --> 00:58:36.506 A:middle
across all of your devices.

00:58:36.506 --> 00:58:38.566 A:middle
So you're dealing with one Siri

00:58:38.866 --> 00:58:40.316 A:middle
but of course this is kept

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.956 A:middle
completely private, readable

00:58:41.956 --> 00:58:43.446 A:middle
only by you and your devices.

00:58:45.516 --> 00:58:50.156 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:58:50.656 --> 00:58:52.266 A:middle
Next, let's talk about the

00:58:52.266 --> 00:58:52.956 A:middle
camera.

00:58:53.576 --> 00:58:54.796 A:middle
People love the fantastic

00:58:54.796 --> 00:58:57.756 A:middle
cameras in the iPhone 7 and 7

00:58:57.756 --> 00:58:58.156 A:middle
Plus.

00:58:58.156 --> 00:59:00.096 A:middle
And in fact, our customers now

00:59:00.096 --> 00:59:03.766 A:middle
take a trillion photos per year.

00:59:04.036 --> 00:59:05.396 A:middle
It's absolutely amazing.

00:59:05.396 --> 00:59:06.666 A:middle
And they take a lot of video

00:59:06.666 --> 00:59:07.126 A:middle
too.

00:59:07.126 --> 00:59:09.866 A:middle
And today, they do it in H.264.

00:59:09.866 --> 00:59:11.936 A:middle
But now with our latest iPhones

00:59:11.936 --> 00:59:16.416 A:middle
in iOS 7, they get or using

00:59:16.416 --> 00:59:18.186 A:middle
HEVC, which is giving us up to

00:59:18.186 --> 00:59:20.436 A:middle
two times better compression for

00:59:20.436 --> 00:59:22.126 A:middle
camera-captured videos, which

00:59:22.126 --> 00:59:23.936 A:middle
means less storage space used on

00:59:23.936 --> 00:59:26.166 A:middle
your device and less space used

00:59:26.166 --> 00:59:26.796 A:middle
in the cloud.

00:59:26.796 --> 00:59:28.316 A:middle
And we're applying these same

00:59:28.316 --> 00:59:30.226 A:middle
techniques to replace JPEG

High Efficiency Image Format.

00:59:35.136 --> 00:59:37.676 A:middle
It's based on HEVC and it also

00:59:37.676 --> 00:59:39.596 A:middle
provides awesome quality images

00:59:40.206 --> 00:59:42.796 A:middle
at half the size on your device.

00:59:43.516 --> 00:59:49.336 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:59:49.836 --> 00:59:51.176 A:middle
And, of course, you can still

00:59:51.176 --> 00:59:53.036 A:middle
share completely compatibly with

00:59:53.036 --> 00:59:53.496 A:middle
others.

00:59:53.986 --> 00:59:56.486 A:middle
Now, with the iPhone 7 Plus, we

00:59:56.486 --> 00:59:58.066 A:middle
love taking these beautiful

00:59:58.066 --> 00:59:58.976 A:middle
portrait photos.

00:59:59.126 --> 01:00:01.756 A:middle
And now, with iOS 11, we can

01:00:02.246 --> 01:00:05.866 A:middle
take low light photographs using

01:00:05.916 --> 01:00:07.416 A:middle
optical image stabilization,

01:00:07.686 --> 01:00:10.166 A:middle
True Tone Flash, HDR delivers

01:00:10.596 --> 01:00:12.736 A:middle
incredible image quality.

01:00:13.096 --> 01:00:14.196 A:middle
And we're taking the depth

01:00:14.196 --> 01:00:15.356 A:middle
information that we can capture

01:00:15.356 --> 01:00:17.026 A:middle
with two cameras and exposing it

01:00:17.026 --> 01:00:18.926 A:middle
to developers with a new Depth

01:00:18.926 --> 01:00:20.666 A:middle
API which has allowed them to do

01:00:20.666 --> 01:00:22.236 A:middle
incredibly fun and artistic

01:00:22.306 --> 01:00:25.986 A:middle
photos, like this, using the

01:00:25.986 --> 01:00:26.446 A:middle
Depth API.

01:00:26.446 --> 01:00:28.176 A:middle
Now, when you're done taking

01:00:28.176 --> 01:00:29.926 A:middle
your photos, you go to enjoy

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:31.606 A:middle
them in the Photos app.

01:00:31.606 --> 01:00:32.986 A:middle
And one of the ways I love

01:00:32.986 --> 01:00:33.716 A:middle
enjoying them is with the

01:00:33.716 --> 01:00:35.676 A:middle
Memories feature because

01:00:35.676 --> 01:00:37.726 A:middle
Memories is able to scan my

01:00:37.726 --> 01:00:40.386 A:middle
library and find all kinds of

01:00:40.386 --> 01:00:40.826 A:middle
fun events.

01:00:40.826 --> 01:00:41.906 A:middle
And now, it can do more than

01:00:41.906 --> 01:00:42.116 A:middle
ever.

01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:43.826 A:middle
It uses a machine learning to

01:00:43.826 --> 01:00:45.876 A:middle
identify things like sporting

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:47.846 A:middle
events, even weddings,

01:00:47.846 --> 01:00:50.256 A:middle
anniversaries, memories of your

01:00:50.256 --> 01:00:50.786 A:middle
babies.

01:00:50.926 --> 01:00:51.736 A:middle
It's really great.

01:00:52.006 --> 01:00:53.336 A:middle
And when you go to play those

01:00:53.336 --> 01:00:55.616 A:middle
back, you can see them not just

01:00:55.616 --> 01:00:56.866 A:middle
in normal landscape orientation

01:00:56.866 --> 01:00:58.436 A:middle
but now watch them in portrait

01:00:58.436 --> 01:00:59.876 A:middle
taking full advantage of the

01:00:59.876 --> 01:01:00.756 A:middle
height of your display.

01:01:00.756 --> 01:01:02.766 A:middle

01:01:02.816 --> 01:01:03.866 A:middle
photos, we have some great

01:01:03.866 --> 01:01:05.876 A:middle
enhancements as well.

01:01:06.176 --> 01:01:07.996 A:middle
So, you can now trim your live

01:01:07.996 --> 01:01:09.106 A:middle

01:01:09.636 --> 01:01:10.936 A:middle
You can mark any part of the

01:01:10.936 --> 01:01:12.436 A:middle
video as your key photo and so

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:13.076 A:middle
much more.

01:01:13.786 --> 01:01:15.036 A:middle
So, these are some of the big

01:01:15.036 --> 01:01:16.306 A:middle
features in the iOS 11.

01:01:16.546 --> 01:01:18.126 A:middle
There's one other which is a

01:01:18.126 --> 01:01:20.656 A:middle
major redesign, the Control

01:01:20.656 --> 01:01:21.046 A:middle
Center.

01:01:21.046 --> 01:01:23.486 A:middle
Rather than show in slides, how

01:01:23.686 --> 01:01:24.426 A:middle
about we do a demo?

[ Applause and Cheering ]

01:01:30.216 --> 01:01:31.686 A:middle
All right, let's take our first

01:01:32.006 --> 01:01:32.676 A:middle
live look.

01:01:32.946 --> 01:01:34.316 A:middle
No, I don't want to do that.

01:01:35.066 --> 01:01:36.656 A:middle
Let's take our first live look

01:01:37.616 --> 01:01:39.246 A:middle
at iOS 11.

01:01:39.246 --> 01:01:40.246 A:middle
Now, I'm going to just bring up

01:01:40.246 --> 01:01:42.626 A:middle
Control Center as always and

01:01:42.626 --> 01:01:43.796 A:middle
what you'll notice is Control

01:01:43.796 --> 01:01:46.026 A:middle
Center is now a single page.

01:01:46.166 --> 01:01:48.526 A:middle

01:01:48.526 --> 01:01:49.366 A:middle
single page.

01:01:49.776 --> 01:01:50.996 A:middle
Now, of course, it has simple

01:01:50.996 --> 01:01:51.916 A:middle
switches, I'll just do an

01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:52.936 A:middle
orientation lock.

01:01:53.316 --> 01:01:54.216 A:middle
It's got a beautiful little

01:01:54.216 --> 01:01:55.316 A:middle
animation there for the

01:01:55.316 --> 01:01:56.086 A:middle
orientation lock.

01:01:56.506 --> 01:01:58.036 A:middle
It has sliders available so you

01:01:58.036 --> 01:01:59.386 A:middle
can adjust volume like this.

01:01:59.386 --> 01:02:01.066 A:middle
But it provides greater depth

01:02:01.406 --> 01:02:03.506 A:middle
because with 3D Touch, 3D Touch

01:02:03.546 --> 01:02:04.896 A:middle
on slider like this and get

01:02:04.896 --> 01:02:06.256 A:middle
access to more controls.

01:02:06.616 --> 01:02:08.336 A:middle
And this allows us to pack lots

01:02:08.336 --> 01:02:10.316 A:middle
of capabilities really easily

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:11.476 A:middle
into the design.

01:02:11.476 --> 01:02:12.966 A:middle
So you see, we have our wireless

01:02:12.966 --> 01:02:14.336 A:middle
control so I could just tap on

01:02:14.336 --> 01:02:14.956 A:middle
Airplane Mode.

01:02:14.956 --> 01:02:16.586 A:middle
But if I 3D Touch on the

platter, I get access to even

01:02:18.586 --> 01:02:19.506 A:middle
more features.

your music because you can

01:02:22.766 --> 01:02:25.246 A:middle

even more information.

01:02:28.326 --> 01:02:29.246 A:middle
Control Center and I think

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:30.206 A:middle

Now, we've also taken this

01:02:36.036 --> 01:02:38.646 A:middle
opportunity to redesign lock

01:02:47.166 --> 01:02:49.496 A:middle
just like that, I can actually

bunch of video automatically

the best shot wasn't the still.

01:04:18.676 --> 01:04:21.256 A:middle
where we have a still landscape

01:04:21.536 --> 01:04:22.676 A:middle

01:09:05.376 --> 01:09:07.916 A:middle
same level of safety to everyone

01:09:07.916 --> 01:09:09.146 A:middle
who maybe doesn't have one of

01:09:09.146 --> 01:09:11.576 A:middle
the 200 models of cars that

01:09:11.576 --> 01:09:12.976 A:middle
currently support CarPlay.

01:09:12.976 --> 01:09:15.046 A:middle
And we're building on "Do Not

01:09:15.046 --> 01:09:16.646 A:middle
Disturb" with a new feature we

01:09:16.646 --> 01:09:18.566 A:middle
call "Do Not Disturb While

01:09:18.566 --> 01:09:19.036 A:middle
Driving".

01:09:19.036 --> 01:09:21.506 A:middle
And it's all about keeping your

01:09:21.506 --> 01:09:22.396 A:middle
eyes on the road.

01:09:22.396 --> 01:09:23.896 A:middle
When you're driving, you don't

01:09:23.896 --> 01:09:26.016 A:middle
need to be responding to these

01:09:26.016 --> 01:09:27.586 A:middle
kinds of messages.

01:09:27.586 --> 01:09:28.626 A:middle
In fact, you don't need to see

01:09:28.626 --> 01:09:28.846 A:middle
them.

01:09:29.856 --> 01:09:33.816 A:middle
So now, when you install iOS 11,

01:09:34.256 --> 01:09:35.576 A:middle
we're going to use Bluetooth to

01:09:35.576 --> 01:09:36.676 A:middle
understand if you're connected

01:09:36.676 --> 01:09:36.896 A:middle
to a car.

01:09:36.896 --> 01:09:37.776 A:middle
Or even if you don't have

01:09:37.776 --> 01:09:39.346 A:middle
Bluetooth, we're going to use

01:09:39.346 --> 01:09:41.686 A:middle
WiFi Doppler effect to measure

01:09:41.686 --> 01:09:43.016 A:middle
that you're moving in a car.

01:09:43.146 --> 01:09:44.296 A:middle
And when you finish that first

01:09:44.296 --> 01:09:45.326 A:middle

01:09:45.466 --> 01:09:46.866 A:middle
hey how about we activate "Do

01:09:46.866 --> 01:09:48.036 A:middle
Not Disturb While Driving".

01:09:48.396 --> 01:09:50.046 A:middle
And when we do, instead of

01:09:50.046 --> 01:09:51.756 A:middle
seeing all those notifications,

01:09:52.066 --> 01:09:53.396 A:middle
we have this new user interface

01:09:53.396 --> 01:09:53.766 A:middle

Now, if you're tempted and you

01:10:04.936 --> 01:10:06.166 A:middle
try to turn on your phone,

01:10:06.216 --> 01:10:07.466 A:middle
you're actually going to receive

01:10:07.466 --> 01:10:09.616 A:middle
this, a little reminder that

01:10:09.616 --> 01:10:10.246 A:middle
you're not receiving

01:10:12.826 --> 01:10:14.026 A:middle
sitting in the back seat in

01:10:14.296 --> 01:10:15.416 A:middle
which case, you can tell us,

01:10:15.416 --> 01:10:16.606 A:middle
"I'm not driving and you could

01:10:16.606 --> 01:10:17.096 A:middle
get through."

01:10:17.096 --> 01:10:18.346 A:middle
But what if you are driving and

01:10:18.346 --> 01:10:19.496 A:middle
someone sent you a message?

01:10:20.266 --> 01:10:21.206 A:middle
Well, they can now get an

01:10:21.206 --> 01:10:23.456 A:middle
automatic response saying, "I'll

01:10:23.516 --> 01:10:24.446 A:middle

You can have the peace of mind

01:10:30.966 --> 01:10:32.416 A:middle
that you can get contacted and

01:10:32.486 --> 01:10:33.796 A:middle
they can reply urgent and that

We think this is going to be a

01:10:36.266 --> 01:10:38.256 A:middle
real important step in safety in

01:15:09.826 --> 01:15:11.166 A:middle
And customers are doing things

01:15:11.166 --> 01:15:12.076 A:middle
with them that none of us have

01:15:12.076 --> 01:15:13.296 A:middle
ever imagined.

01:15:13.776 --> 01:15:14.246 A:middle
Like this.

These are people in Hong Kong

playing Pokemon Go.

01:15:21.456 --> 01:15:22.876 A:middle
Pokemon Go is from Niantic.

01:15:22.876 --> 01:15:24.066 A:middle
It was one of the big hits from

01:15:24.066 --> 01:15:24.826 A:middle
last year and there have been a

01:15:24.826 --> 01:15:26.216 A:middle
lot of big hits last year from

01:15:26.216 --> 01:15:27.286 A:middle
big developers and indie

01:15:27.286 --> 01:15:28.116 A:middle
developers alike.

01:15:28.116 --> 01:15:30.436 A:middle
And together, the developers at

01:15:30.436 --> 01:15:32.436 A:middle
Apple, we've made this the best

01:15:32.436 --> 01:15:34.096 A:middle
app platform in the world.

01:15:34.096 --> 01:15:34.976 A:middle

01:15:38.896 --> 01:15:40.816 A:middle
Yes. Thank you for the

01:15:40.816 --> 01:15:42.566 A:middle
incredible apps you make that we

01:15:42.566 --> 01:15:43.796 A:middle
and our customers all love.

01:15:44.346 --> 01:15:45.976 A:middle
It's not by chance that the App

01:15:45.976 --> 01:15:47.076 A:middle
Store has become such a great

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:47.516 A:middle
place.

01:15:47.766 --> 01:15:48.766 A:middle
From the beginning, we've had

01:15:48.766 --> 01:15:50.916 A:middle
two very important goals, to

01:15:50.916 --> 01:15:52.556 A:middle
make the App Store a trusted and

01:15:52.556 --> 01:15:55.056 A:middle
safe place for users and to make

01:15:55.056 --> 01:15:57.436 A:middle
it a great opportunity for all

01:15:57.436 --> 01:15:58.206 A:middle
developers.

01:15:58.516 --> 01:16:00.066 A:middle
We continue to work really hard

01:16:00.066 --> 01:16:00.356 A:middle
at that.

01:16:00.356 --> 01:16:02.136 A:middle
Over the last year, the team has

01:16:02.136 --> 01:16:03.526 A:middle
done a lot of great things to

01:16:03.526 --> 01:16:04.966 A:middle
make the App Store an even

01:16:04.966 --> 01:16:06.656 A:middle
better store for all of us.

01:16:06.986 --> 01:16:08.116 A:middle
There's many things we can talk

01:16:08.116 --> 01:16:09.566 A:middle
about but I think one stands

01:16:09.566 --> 01:16:10.446 A:middle
head and shoulders above the

01:16:10.446 --> 01:16:12.906 A:middle
rest, faster app review times.

[ Applause ]

01:16:14.066 --> 01:16:18.746 A:middle
Yes. I'm sure you're well aware

01:16:19.056 --> 01:16:20.116 A:middle
that the majority of apps are

01:16:20.116 --> 01:16:22.116 A:middle
all now reviewed in under 24

01:16:22.116 --> 01:16:23.986 A:middle
hours, many in just one to two

01:16:23.986 --> 01:16:24.456 A:middle
hours.

01:16:24.716 --> 01:16:25.496 A:middle
The team is going to keep

01:16:25.496 --> 01:16:26.386 A:middle
working hard at that.

01:16:26.576 --> 01:16:28.456 A:middle
And we have a lot more coming

01:16:28.456 --> 01:16:29.976 A:middle
for the remainder of the year.

01:16:29.976 --> 01:16:31.066 A:middle
I've highlighted a bunch of

01:16:31.106 --> 01:16:31.826 A:middle
things here.

01:16:31.986 --> 01:16:33.406 A:middle
I'll just point out one of them.

01:16:33.666 --> 01:16:34.946 A:middle
You can read some of your

01:16:34.946 --> 01:16:36.096 A:middle
favorite things up there.

01:16:36.096 --> 01:16:37.316 A:middle
A big request in developers is

01:16:37.316 --> 01:16:38.836 A:middle
called phased releases.

01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:39.516 A:middle
Now when you--

01:16:39.626 --> 01:16:39.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Woo!

01:16:39.796 --> 01:16:42.076 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Yes, woo for phased releases,

01:16:42.076 --> 01:16:42.516 A:middle
come on.

01:16:42.686 --> 01:16:44.946 A:middle
Phased releases means, when you

01:16:45.026 --> 01:16:47.156 A:middle
submit an app, you can choose if

01:16:47.196 --> 01:16:48.546 A:middle
you want it to be phased over

01:16:48.546 --> 01:16:49.946 A:middle
time so it doesn't hit your

01:16:49.946 --> 01:16:51.556 A:middle
infrastructure all at once and

01:16:51.556 --> 01:16:52.746 A:middle
you can see how customers are

01:16:52.746 --> 01:16:54.296 A:middle
responding to that update.

01:16:54.596 --> 01:16:56.086 A:middle
So it's really great feature for

01:16:56.086 --> 01:16:57.086 A:middle
you to take advantage of.

01:16:57.086 --> 01:16:58.566 A:middle
And there are a lot of things

01:16:58.616 --> 01:17:00.306 A:middle
coming this year but there is

01:17:00.306 --> 01:17:03.416 A:middle
one that is incredibly gigantic.

01:17:03.996 --> 01:17:04.866 A:middle
And that is we're going to do

01:17:04.896 --> 01:17:06.136 A:middle
something that we've never done

01:17:06.136 --> 01:17:07.176 A:middle
before in the nine years of the

01:17:07.176 --> 01:17:07.716 A:middle
App Store.

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:09.406 A:middle
We're going to completely

01:17:09.406 --> 01:17:12.256 A:middle
redesign it, a brand new App

brand new tab called Today.

01:17:24.856 --> 01:17:26.656 A:middle
Did you remember back the first

01:17:26.656 --> 01:17:27.846 A:middle
time you started downloading

01:17:27.846 --> 01:17:29.806 A:middle
apps when you use the App Store

01:17:29.926 --> 01:17:31.406 A:middle
and it was so much fun to go in

01:17:31.406 --> 01:17:33.126 A:middle
every single day and discover

01:17:33.126 --> 01:17:34.096 A:middle
the new apps that were

01:17:34.096 --> 01:17:34.566 A:middle
appearing?

01:17:34.566 --> 01:17:36.096 A:middle

01:17:38.146 --> 01:17:39.956 A:middle
again with this brand new tab

the stories about the developers

who created them.

01:20:44.296 --> 01:20:47.626 A:middle
animated GIFs or GIFs.

01:20:48.996 --> 01:20:51.436 A:middle
Anyway, you can make them.

01:20:51.436 --> 01:20:53.106 A:middle
I just scroll back up and pull

01:20:53.106 --> 01:20:54.906 A:middle
down on the card and I'm back in

01:20:54.906 --> 01:20:55.366 A:middle
the feed.

01:20:56.656 --> 01:20:58.036 A:middle
Every day there's a new app of

01:20:58.036 --> 01:21:00.586 A:middle
the day and a new game of the

01:21:00.586 --> 01:21:03.126 A:middle
day and the daily list.

01:21:03.786 --> 01:21:04.806 A:middle
These are great because they're

01:21:04.886 --> 01:21:06.616 A:middle
focused on a theme or a goal

01:21:06.616 --> 01:21:07.956 A:middle
like meditation.

01:21:08.736 --> 01:21:10.216 A:middle
I've actually been trying some

01:21:10.216 --> 01:21:14.366 A:middle
of these out to get ready for

01:21:14.646 --> 01:21:15.836 A:middle
this and it's totally working.

01:21:16.116 --> 01:21:18.886 A:middle
If I'm busy and miss a day, I

01:21:18.886 --> 01:21:21.486 A:middle
can scroll down and see stories

01:21:21.486 --> 01:21:22.536 A:middle
from earlier in the week.

01:21:23.096 --> 01:21:24.206 A:middle
So that's the Today tab.

01:21:25.356 --> 01:21:27.926 A:middle
If I only want to see games, now

01:21:27.926 --> 01:21:29.676 A:middle
I can go to the New Games tab.

01:21:30.136 --> 01:21:31.026 A:middle
This is huge.

01:21:31.216 --> 01:21:31.816 A:middle
Let's check it out.

01:21:32.216 --> 01:21:33.836 A:middle
Up at the top I can see the

01:21:33.836 --> 01:21:36.076 A:middle
biggest new releases or just

01:21:36.196 --> 01:21:37.206 A:middle
what the game editors are

01:21:37.206 --> 01:21:38.096 A:middle
playing this week.

01:21:38.096 --> 01:21:40.406 A:middle
If I scroll down I can watch a

01:21:40.406 --> 01:21:42.196 A:middle
whole bunch of game videos.

01:21:42.306 --> 01:21:45.076 A:middle
And it's not just previews but

01:21:45.076 --> 01:21:47.366 A:middle
also tips and gameplay videos by

01:21:47.366 --> 01:21:48.246 A:middle
editors too.

01:21:48.246 --> 01:21:50.536 A:middle
If I scroll down, I can see

01:21:50.536 --> 01:21:53.056 A:middle
charts that only feature games.

01:21:53.186 --> 01:21:54.756 A:middle
So it's really easy to see what

01:21:54.756 --> 01:21:56.266 A:middle
the most popular games are

01:21:56.516 --> 01:21:59.126 A:middle
separate from apps.

01:21:59.126 --> 01:22:00.696 A:middle
And now I can browse by game

01:22:00.786 --> 01:22:01.706 A:middle
categories too.

01:22:03.236 --> 01:22:04.896 A:middle
This page is just packed full of

01:22:04.896 --> 01:22:05.756 A:middle
recommendations.

01:22:06.306 --> 01:22:07.596 A:middle
This artsy game looks fun.

01:22:07.826 --> 01:22:08.606 A:middle
Let's check it out.

01:22:08.666 --> 01:22:10.346 A:middle
I'm going to tap on the icon and

01:22:10.716 --> 01:22:12.916 A:middle
it opens up a redesigned app

01:22:13.146 --> 01:22:13.586 A:middle
page.

01:22:13.686 --> 01:22:15.496 A:middle
It's more beautiful and more

01:22:15.496 --> 01:22:16.046 A:middle
useful.

01:22:16.486 --> 01:22:18.026 A:middle
I can watch more videos that

01:22:18.026 --> 01:22:19.546 A:middle
show me how fun this is.

01:22:19.546 --> 01:22:21.656 A:middle
And this badge at the top tells

01:22:21.696 --> 01:22:23.626 A:middle
me it was named editor's choice.

01:22:23.626 --> 01:22:26.116 A:middle
If I scroll down, I can see

01:22:26.116 --> 01:22:27.596 A:middle
ratings and reviews front and

01:22:27.596 --> 01:22:29.206 A:middle
center so I can see what other

01:22:29.206 --> 01:22:30.966 A:middle
customers think before making a

01:22:31.006 --> 01:22:31.346 A:middle
choice.

01:22:31.866 --> 01:22:34.056 A:middle
Like this review, it tells me

01:22:34.056 --> 01:22:35.506 A:middle
this game is great for killing

01:22:35.676 --> 01:22:35.906 A:middle
time.

01:22:36.326 --> 01:22:38.446 A:middle
Thanks, FuriousPotatoFace.

01:22:39.056 --> 01:22:42.246 A:middle
For all the incredible apps on

01:22:42.246 --> 01:22:43.906 A:middle
the store there's a new tab too,

01:22:44.106 --> 01:22:44.596 A:middle
the Apps tab.

01:22:45.036 --> 01:22:45.616 A:middle
Let's go there.

01:22:46.676 --> 01:22:48.466 A:middle
It shares the same great design

01:22:48.776 --> 01:22:50.256 A:middle
as the Games tab but with a

01:22:50.336 --> 01:22:51.646 A:middle
focus just on apps.

01:22:51.896 --> 01:22:55.136 A:middle
So that was just the first day

01:22:55.196 --> 01:22:56.306 A:middle
on the new App Store.

01:22:56.466 --> 01:22:58.366 A:middle
Now you can see why we're so

01:22:58.366 --> 01:23:00.006 A:middle
excited to have a beautiful new

01:23:00.006 --> 01:23:02.216 A:middle
place to share apps and games we

01:23:02.216 --> 01:23:02.996 A:middle
love with you.

01:23:02.996 --> 01:23:04.316 A:middle
Back to you, Phil.

01:23:09.596 --> 01:23:10.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ann.

01:23:11.566 --> 01:23:12.846 A:middle
So that's your first glimpse of

01:23:12.846 --> 01:23:14.476 A:middle
an entirely new App Store.

01:23:14.566 --> 01:23:15.496 A:middle
We hope you love it.

01:23:15.496 --> 01:23:16.946 A:middle
We hope customers love it and

01:23:17.146 --> 01:23:18.716 A:middle
visit it every single day to

01:23:18.716 --> 01:23:20.196 A:middle
download your incredible apps.

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:22.936 A:middle
And that's it for the App Store.

01:23:22.936 --> 01:23:23.766 A:middle
Back to you, Craig.

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Phil.

01:23:28.426 --> 01:23:29.736 A:middle
The App Store looks just

01:23:29.786 --> 01:23:30.626 A:middle
fantastic.

01:23:30.906 --> 01:23:32.856 A:middle
So those are some of the big

01:23:32.926 --> 01:23:35.216 A:middle
features in iOS 11.

01:23:35.216 --> 01:23:37.026 A:middle
But of course, there's also core

01:23:37.026 --> 01:23:37.726 A:middle
technologies.

01:23:37.726 --> 01:23:39.626 A:middle
Now, Metal 2 and HEVC coming to

01:23:39.786 --> 01:23:43.376 A:middle
iOS as well, but there's more

01:23:43.376 --> 01:23:45.806 A:middle
and it starts with machine

01:23:45.806 --> 01:23:46.186 A:middle
learning.

01:23:46.916 --> 01:23:49.136 A:middle
Now, you've seen the way we've

01:23:49.186 --> 01:23:50.626 A:middle
used machine leaning throughout

01:23:50.626 --> 01:23:52.766 A:middle
the experiences on Apple Watch,

01:23:53.006 --> 01:23:54.256 A:middle
for instance, and the predictive

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:55.456 A:middle
Siri watch face.

01:23:56.536 --> 01:23:59.216 A:middle
We use it on the iPad for palm

01:24:00.256 --> 01:24:01.126 A:middle
with Apple Pencil.

01:24:01.126 --> 01:24:04.706 A:middle
Of course, we use it to extend

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:06.046 A:middle
your battery life by predicting

01:24:06.046 --> 01:24:06.906 A:middle
how you're going to use your

01:24:06.906 --> 01:24:07.486 A:middle
device.

01:24:08.456 --> 01:24:09.746 A:middle
And you've seen it throughout

01:24:09.876 --> 01:24:12.486 A:middle
photos with memories and face

01:24:12.486 --> 01:24:13.086 A:middle
recognition.

01:24:13.796 --> 01:24:14.916 A:middle
Well now, for all of you

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:16.186 A:middle
developers, we want to make

01:24:16.246 --> 01:24:18.046 A:middle
powerful machine learning easy

01:24:18.046 --> 01:24:19.366 A:middle
for you to incorporate in your

01:24:19.366 --> 01:24:19.706 A:middle
apps.

01:24:19.926 --> 01:24:21.496 A:middle
And we're doing it via set of

01:24:21.846 --> 01:24:22.786 A:middle
new APIs.

01:24:23.196 --> 01:24:24.766 A:middle
Starts with the vision API which

01:24:24.766 --> 01:24:26.496 A:middle
provides face tracking, face

01:24:26.496 --> 01:24:27.926 A:middle
detection, landmarks, all of

01:24:27.926 --> 01:24:29.206 A:middle
these core features we use

01:24:29.206 --> 01:24:30.886 A:middle
inside of our apps.

01:24:31.596 --> 01:24:33.336 A:middle
And the natural language API

01:24:33.336 --> 01:24:35.186 A:middle
that provides capabilities like

01:24:35.216 --> 01:24:36.836 A:middle
tokenization and named entity

01:24:36.836 --> 01:24:37.516 A:middle
recognition.

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:40.146 A:middle
Now, these are all built on Core

01:24:40.396 --> 01:24:40.626 A:middle
ML.

01:24:40.626 --> 01:24:44.366 A:middle
And Core ML provides high

01:24:44.366 --> 01:24:46.196 A:middle
performance implementations of

01:24:46.196 --> 01:24:47.756 A:middle
deep neural networks, recurrent

01:24:47.756 --> 01:24:49.136 A:middle
neural networks, convolution

01:24:49.136 --> 01:24:50.406 A:middle
neural networks, support vector

01:24:50.406 --> 01:24:50.946 A:middle
machines.

01:24:51.476 --> 01:24:52.666 A:middle
And they allow you to take

01:24:52.666 --> 01:24:53.726 A:middle
models that you've built with

01:24:53.726 --> 01:24:55.376 A:middle
any of these popular third party

01:24:55.376 --> 01:24:55.806 A:middle
tools.

01:24:56.156 --> 01:24:57.716 A:middle
And using our machine leaning

01:24:57.716 --> 01:24:59.806 A:middle

carefully tuned compatibility

01:25:06.896 --> 01:25:08.736 A:middle
with all of our platforms, and

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:10.476 A:middle
the performance really is

01:25:10.476 --> 01:25:11.186 A:middle
incredible.

called Inception v3.

01:25:32.156 --> 01:25:35.276 A:middle
Now, with Multi-Touch, it really

01:25:35.276 --> 01:25:36.646 A:middle
changed the way that you

01:25:36.646 --> 01:25:38.866 A:middle
interact with the world on the

01:25:38.866 --> 01:25:39.936 A:middle
screen of your iPhone.

01:25:40.756 --> 01:25:42.346 A:middle
And with the camera, it allowed

01:25:42.346 --> 01:25:44.496 A:middle
you to capture the world around

01:25:44.496 --> 01:25:44.696 A:middle
you.

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:46.406 A:middle
But when you bring these things

01:25:46.406 --> 01:25:48.186 A:middle
together, the results can

01:25:48.246 --> 01:25:49.586 A:middle
actually be quite profound.

01:25:50.026 --> 01:25:51.096 A:middle
Now it's called the augmented

01:25:51.096 --> 01:25:53.306 A:middle
reality and we have a new core

01:25:53.306 --> 01:25:56.106 A:middle

it to all of you.

something for real.

surfaces such as this table and

01:26:26.076 --> 01:26:27.726 A:middle

Well, ARKit provides fast and

stable motion tracking and it

01:27:29.906 --> 01:27:32.016 A:middle
uses all of the sensors and the

01:27:32.016 --> 01:27:33.296 A:middle
camera in your device to do

01:27:33.296 --> 01:27:33.496 A:middle
this.

It's able to estimate ambient

01:27:40.526 --> 01:27:41.856 A:middle

The implementation is possible

01:27:53.666 --> 01:27:54.516 A:middle
because we're able to take

01:27:54.516 --> 01:27:55.456 A:middle

story is, of course, iPad.

[ Applause and Cheering ]

01:33:38.346 --> 01:33:41.046 A:middle
iPad has completely changed the

01:33:41.046 --> 01:33:45.386 A:middle
way we work, play, teach, learn

01:33:45.466 --> 01:33:46.256 A:middle
and create.

01:33:46.896 --> 01:33:49.206 A:middle
It's truly a magical piece of

01:33:49.206 --> 01:33:51.156 A:middle
glass that transforms into

01:33:51.156 --> 01:33:52.656 A:middle
anything you want.

01:33:53.916 --> 01:33:55.026 A:middle
We've been pushing the

01:33:55.026 --> 01:33:56.896 A:middle
boundaries on iPad.

01:33:57.906 --> 01:34:00.186 A:middle
And today, we're going to push

01:34:00.186 --> 01:34:02.906 A:middle
them further than ever before.

01:34:16.086 --> 01:34:17.096 A:middle
And good morning, everybody.

01:34:17.096 --> 01:34:18.476 A:middle
I'm so excited to talk to you

01:34:18.476 --> 01:34:20.736 A:middle
today about iPad Pro.

01:34:21.186 --> 01:34:22.886 A:middle
When we first introduced iPad

01:34:22.936 --> 01:34:25.066 A:middle
Pro just 18 months ago, it

01:34:25.066 --> 01:34:26.386 A:middle
completely redefined what you

01:34:26.386 --> 01:34:27.606 A:middle
could do with your iPad.

01:34:27.856 --> 01:34:29.416 A:middle
Along with your incredible apps,

01:34:29.546 --> 01:34:30.656 A:middle
it allowed our users to do

01:34:30.716 --> 01:34:32.766 A:middle
really amazing things, from

01:34:32.766 --> 01:34:34.046 A:middle
professional design and

01:34:34.046 --> 01:34:36.156 A:middle
illustration to fashion, to

01:34:36.156 --> 01:34:37.686 A:middle
architecture, to engineering and

01:34:37.816 --> 01:34:38.726 A:middle
so much more.

01:34:39.726 --> 01:34:41.126 A:middle
We're really excited about what

01:34:41.426 --> 01:34:43.716 A:middle
can be real in your world today

01:34:43.716 --> 01:34:44.816 A:middle
with iPad Pro.

01:34:45.796 --> 01:34:46.926 A:middle
Well, as you know, there's two

01:34:46.926 --> 01:34:48.206 A:middle
models to iPad Pro today.

01:34:48.206 --> 01:34:50.226 A:middle
There's a 13-inch and a

01:34:50.226 --> 01:34:51.316 A:middle
9.7-inch.

01:34:51.666 --> 01:34:53.336 A:middle
And the 9.7-inch is our most

01:34:53.376 --> 01:34:54.216 A:middle
popular model.

01:34:54.786 --> 01:34:56.296 A:middle
It has a screen large enough to

01:34:56.296 --> 01:34:57.776 A:middle
get your work done, but it's in

01:34:57.776 --> 01:34:59.146 A:middle
a thin and light enough package

01:34:59.146 --> 01:35:00.316 A:middle
that allows you to take it with

01:35:00.346 --> 01:35:01.626 A:middle
you everywhere you go.

01:35:02.516 --> 01:35:03.636 A:middle
Well, today, we're going to

01:35:03.636 --> 01:35:05.556 A:middle
introduce an all new iPad Pro.

01:35:06.356 --> 01:35:07.246 A:middle
It's going to take everything

01:35:09.966 --> 01:35:10.996 A:middle
give you a whole lot more to

01:35:10.996 --> 01:35:11.266 A:middle
love.

01:35:11.776 --> 01:35:13.146 A:middle
Let's take a look.

01:35:14.596 --> 01:35:16.756 A:middle
This is the new iPad Pro.

[ Applause and Cheering ]

01:35:21.696 --> 01:35:23.136 A:middle
It's the first iPad Pro with a

01:35:23.136 --> 01:35:25.106 A:middle
larger 10 and a half inch Retina

01:35:25.106 --> 01:35:25.836 A:middle
display.

01:35:26.726 --> 01:35:27.976 A:middle
Now, why 10 and a half inch?

01:35:28.566 --> 01:35:29.676 A:middle
Well, for one, it's a lot

01:35:29.676 --> 01:35:30.146 A:middle
larger.

01:35:30.376 --> 01:35:32.776 A:middle
It's 20% larger than a 9.7-inch.

01:35:33.066 --> 01:35:34.306 A:middle
But we are able to reduce the

01:35:34.306 --> 01:35:35.996 A:middle
borders by nearly 40% which

01:35:35.996 --> 01:35:37.436 A:middle
allows us to submit it in this

01:35:37.436 --> 01:35:39.536 A:middle
incredibly compact design that

01:35:39.536 --> 01:35:42.076 A:middle
still weighs just one pound.

01:35:42.586 --> 01:35:45.456 A:middle
And of course, 10.5-inch also

01:35:45.456 --> 01:35:46.396 A:middle
allows us to do some other

01:35:46.466 --> 01:35:46.776 A:middle
things.

01:35:47.146 --> 01:35:49.176 A:middle
It's the perfect size to allow

01:35:49.176 --> 01:35:50.916 A:middle

Now, iPad Pro has always had the

01:36:19.636 --> 01:36:21.386 A:middle
best displays in the industry.

01:36:21.706 --> 01:36:24.266 A:middle
And both sizes are going to get

01:36:24.266 --> 01:36:25.946 A:middle
really incredible new displays

01:36:25.946 --> 01:36:26.086 A:middle

01:36:26.086 --> 01:36:27.986 A:middle
They're the best displays that

01:36:27.986 --> 01:36:28.866 A:middle
we've ever made.

01:36:29.996 --> 01:36:31.076 A:middle
They're packed with incredible

01:36:31.076 --> 01:36:32.246 A:middle
features like True Tone for

01:36:32.246 --> 01:36:34.866 A:middle
automatic white balance, P3 wide

01:36:34.866 --> 01:36:36.606 A:middle
color gamut for the best color,

01:36:37.746 --> 01:36:39.626 A:middle

01:36:39.736 --> 01:36:40.746 A:middle
in the industry.

01:36:41.466 --> 01:36:42.936 A:middle
And they're 50% brighter with

01:36:43.066 --> 01:36:43.936 A:middle
600 nits.

01:36:44.466 --> 01:36:46.226 A:middle
And this extra brightness and

01:36:46.226 --> 01:36:47.546 A:middle
the P3 wide color gamut means

01:36:47.546 --> 01:36:49.006 A:middle
that with iOS 11, you'll be able

01:36:49.006 --> 01:36:51.086 A:middle
to display HDR video for the

01:36:51.086 --> 01:36:53.256 A:middle
first time in an iPad for really

01:36:53.256 --> 01:36:55.036 A:middle
immersive cinematic experience.

01:36:55.436 --> 01:36:56.886 A:middle
They're truly awesome displays.

01:36:57.616 --> 01:36:59.746 A:middle
But our biggest breakthrough is

01:36:59.746 --> 01:37:01.566 A:middle
a feature we call ProMotion.

01:37:02.366 --> 01:37:03.236 A:middle
So what is ProMotion?

01:37:03.726 --> 01:37:05.026 A:middle
Well, we were able to take our

01:37:05.026 --> 01:37:06.976 A:middle
unique hardware and software

01:37:07.326 --> 01:37:09.746 A:middle
capabilities and dramatically

01:37:09.746 --> 01:37:11.596 A:middle
improve our display performance.

01:37:12.386 --> 01:37:13.836 A:middle
Now, typically, up until today,

01:37:13.836 --> 01:37:15.436 A:middle
mobile displays have refresh at

01:37:15.506 --> 01:37:16.746 A:middle
60 hertz, means they update the

01:37:16.746 --> 01:37:18.806 A:middle
content 60 times every second.

01:37:19.426 --> 01:37:22.446 A:middle
Well, on the new iPad Pro, we've

01:37:22.446 --> 01:37:24.016 A:middle
doubled that maximum refresh

01:37:24.016 --> 01:37:26.976 A:middle
rate to an incredible 120 hertz.

[ Applause ]

01:37:32.136 --> 01:37:33.326 A:middle
So what does that mean to you?

01:37:33.326 --> 01:37:34.786 A:middle
It means that all of your motion

01:37:34.786 --> 01:37:35.896 A:middle
content on your screen is going

01:37:35.896 --> 01:37:38.646 A:middle
to be smoother, crisper, more

01:37:38.696 --> 01:37:39.296 A:middle
responsive.

01:37:40.306 --> 01:37:41.186 A:middle
Now, this is something you have

01:37:41.186 --> 01:37:42.196 A:middle
to really touch and feel

01:37:42.196 --> 01:37:43.796 A:middle
yourself to appreciate because

01:37:43.796 --> 01:37:45.076 A:middle
our projection systems just

01:37:45.076 --> 01:37:46.286 A:middle
aren't capable of doing those

01:37:46.286 --> 01:37:47.276 A:middle
type of refresh rates.

01:37:47.726 --> 01:37:48.896 A:middle
But I'll tell you the difference

01:37:48.896 --> 01:37:49.706 A:middle
is dramatic.

01:37:49.706 --> 01:37:51.326 A:middle
And when you scroll, it's

01:37:51.446 --> 01:37:52.296 A:middle
buttery smooth.

01:37:53.446 --> 01:37:54.736 A:middle
Now, the higher refresh rate

01:37:54.736 --> 01:37:56.466 A:middle
also means it works even better

01:37:56.466 --> 01:37:57.416 A:middle
with the Apple Pencil.

01:37:57.696 --> 01:37:58.836 A:middle
We already have the

01:37:58.836 --> 01:38:00.366 A:middle
industry-leading performance for

01:38:00.366 --> 01:38:01.726 A:middle
drawing and writing with the

01:38:01.726 --> 01:38:02.726 A:middle
Apple Pencil, but with

01:38:02.726 --> 01:38:04.316 A:middle
ProMotion, it gets even better.

01:38:05.206 --> 01:38:06.516 A:middle
It's more responsive and it

01:38:06.516 --> 01:38:07.936 A:middle
reduces our latency to an

01:38:07.936 --> 01:38:10.566 A:middle
industry best 20 milliseconds.

[ Applause ]

01:38:15.326 --> 01:38:17.206 A:middle
So drawing is incredibly fluid

01:38:17.206 --> 01:38:18.626 A:middle
and even more natural, you're

01:38:18.626 --> 01:38:20.486 A:middle
going to love using the Apple

01:38:20.486 --> 01:38:22.166 A:middle
Pencil of the new iPad Pro.

01:38:22.436 --> 01:38:23.446 A:middle
Another breakthrough of

01:38:23.446 --> 01:38:25.076 A:middle
ProMotion is that these become

01:38:25.076 --> 01:38:26.516 A:middle
the first mobile displays to be

01:38:26.516 --> 01:38:28.266 A:middle
able to dynamically adjust the

01:38:28.266 --> 01:38:29.926 A:middle
refresh rate, depending on what

01:38:29.926 --> 01:38:30.956 A:middle
you're looking at.

01:38:30.956 --> 01:38:31.966 A:middle
This is a really big

01:38:31.966 --> 01:38:33.166 A:middle
breakthrough for both display

01:38:33.166 --> 01:38:35.416 A:middle
quality, as well as for power

01:38:35.416 --> 01:38:35.876 A:middle
savings.

01:38:36.356 --> 01:38:37.686 A:middle
So when you have dash-moving

01:38:37.686 --> 01:38:38.826 A:middle
content, they can update

01:38:38.826 --> 01:38:39.306 A:middle
quickly.

01:38:40.056 --> 01:38:42.266 A:middle
But they can also update slower

01:38:42.266 --> 01:38:43.516 A:middle
when you don't need that type of

01:38:43.516 --> 01:38:44.016 A:middle
refresh rate.

01:38:44.016 --> 01:38:45.816 A:middle
For example, a still image, this

01:38:45.816 --> 01:38:46.886 A:middle
allows us to save a lot of

01:38:46.886 --> 01:38:47.926 A:middle
energy and give you better

01:38:47.926 --> 01:38:48.656 A:middle
battery life.

01:38:49.406 --> 01:38:50.606 A:middle
So, hopefully you see why these

01:38:50.606 --> 01:38:52.176 A:middle
are not just the best displays

01:38:52.176 --> 01:38:54.006 A:middle
that we've ever made, but we

01:38:54.006 --> 01:38:54.996 A:middle
think they're the most advanced

01:38:55.026 --> 01:38:56.026 A:middle
displays in the planet.

01:38:57.516 --> 01:38:58.506 A:middle
Next, let's talk about

01:38:58.506 --> 01:38:58.976 A:middle
performance.

01:39:00.296 --> 01:39:02.296 A:middle
iPad is already best in class

01:39:02.296 --> 01:39:03.046 A:middle
for performance.

01:39:03.436 --> 01:39:04.466 A:middle
But we're not resting on our

01:39:04.466 --> 01:39:05.066 A:middle
laurels.

01:39:05.656 --> 01:39:07.406 A:middle
These are the fastest we've ever

01:39:07.406 --> 01:39:07.906 A:middle
created.

01:39:08.496 --> 01:39:10.066 A:middle

Our chip team has done just an

01:39:45.416 --> 01:39:47.646 A:middle
amazing job over the years with

01:39:47.646 --> 01:39:48.806 A:middle
the performance improvements and

01:39:48.806 --> 01:39:50.206 A:middle
results have been staggering.

01:39:50.546 --> 01:39:51.146 A:middle
They're delivering an

01:39:51.146 --> 01:39:52.296 A:middle
industry-leading graphics

01:39:52.376 --> 01:39:54.596 A:middle
performance that's more than 500

01:39:54.596 --> 01:39:56.086 A:middle
times the original iPad from

01:39:56.086 --> 01:39:57.646 A:middle
just a few years ago.

01:39:58.866 --> 01:40:00.636 A:middle
But of course, numbers only tell

01:40:00.636 --> 01:40:01.426 A:middle
part of the story.

01:40:02.186 --> 01:40:03.396 A:middle
To demonstrate the real-world

01:40:03.396 --> 01:40:04.776 A:middle
performance of the A10X in the

01:40:04.776 --> 01:40:06.896 A:middle
new iPad Pro, I'd like to invite

01:40:06.896 --> 01:40:09.506 A:middle
Ash Hewson of Serif to give you

01:40:09.506 --> 01:40:10.936 A:middle
a demo of their new Pro photo

01:40:10.936 --> 01:40:12.426 A:middle
editing app called Affinity

01:40:12.476 --> 01:40:12.896 A:middle
Photo.

01:40:12.896 --> 01:40:13.156 A:middle
Ash.

[ Applause ]

01:40:16.006 --> 01:40:16.406 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Joz.

01:40:18.926 --> 01:40:19.986 A:middle
So I'm thrilled today to be able

01:40:19.986 --> 01:40:21.396 A:middle
to show you the iPad version of

01:40:21.396 --> 01:40:22.206 A:middle
Affinity Photo.

01:40:22.766 --> 01:40:24.056 A:middle
This is a truly high-end

01:40:24.126 --> 01:40:25.876 A:middle
professional photo editing tool.

01:40:26.256 --> 01:40:28.306 A:middle
And on this latest iPad Pro, we

01:40:28.306 --> 01:40:29.116 A:middle
can achieve levels of

01:40:29.116 --> 01:40:30.676 A:middle
performance which is simply

01:40:30.676 --> 01:40:32.486 A:middle
unattainable on any other

01:40:32.786 --> 01:40:33.176 A:middle
device.

01:40:33.176 --> 01:40:33.926 A:middle
And I'm going to try and show

01:40:33.926 --> 01:40:35.536 A:middle
you that today by creating a

01:40:35.536 --> 01:40:36.286 A:middle
movie poster.

01:40:36.286 --> 01:40:37.136 A:middle
I've already set up a few

01:40:37.136 --> 01:40:37.466 A:middle
layers.

01:40:37.466 --> 01:40:38.286 A:middle
I've kind of got this great

01:40:38.286 --> 01:40:39.636 A:middle
background of some stormy sky.

01:40:39.636 --> 01:40:41.666 A:middle
I've got a turbulent sea and

01:40:41.666 --> 01:40:42.156 A:middle
this ship.

01:40:42.466 --> 01:40:43.116 A:middle
Now, the first thing you'll

01:40:43.116 --> 01:40:44.276 A:middle
notice when you're using this is

01:40:44.276 --> 01:40:45.486 A:middle
as you're kind of moving layers

01:40:45.486 --> 01:40:47.576 A:middle
around, rotating them or even

01:40:47.576 --> 01:40:49.736 A:middle
just sort of panning and zooming

01:40:49.736 --> 01:40:51.336 A:middle
around your work, I'm seeing all

01:40:51.336 --> 01:40:53.336 A:middle
of these now at 120 frames a

01:40:53.336 --> 01:40:53.696 A:middle
second.

01:40:53.696 --> 01:40:54.946 A:middle
So it just feels incredibly

01:40:55.006 --> 01:40:55.426 A:middle
smooth.

01:40:55.426 --> 01:40:57.106 A:middle
But when you come to edit

01:40:57.106 --> 01:40:59.506 A:middle
layers, because of Metal, we can

01:40:59.506 --> 01:41:00.576 A:middle
achieve performance more than

01:41:00.706 --> 01:41:04.166 A:middle
four times than i7 quad core

01:41:04.166 --> 01:41:04.986 A:middle
desktop PC.

01:41:04.986 --> 01:41:06.436 A:middle
And I'll show you what that

01:41:06.436 --> 01:41:06.766 A:middle
means.

01:41:07.186 --> 01:41:08.416 A:middle
On this sea, I'm going to apply

01:41:08.736 --> 01:41:09.576 A:middle
a 12 filter.

01:41:09.906 --> 01:41:11.606 A:middle
And look, just with my finger, I

01:41:11.606 --> 01:41:13.226 A:middle
can kind of push this sea

01:41:13.226 --> 01:41:14.376 A:middle
around, or I can even just like

01:41:14.376 --> 01:41:16.776 A:middle
flick away right over the side

01:41:16.776 --> 01:41:17.696 A:middle
of the ship.

01:41:17.796 --> 01:41:19.566 A:middle
It's a totally new way to kind

01:41:19.566 --> 01:41:21.676 A:middle
of interact with your designs.

01:41:22.146 --> 01:41:23.206 A:middle
And actually, everything is this

01:41:23.206 --> 01:41:23.326 A:middle
fast.

01:41:23.326 --> 01:41:25.456 A:middle
So let's-- So I wanted to set

01:41:25.456 --> 01:41:27.716 A:middle
this ship on fire, for example.

01:41:28.116 --> 01:41:29.366 A:middle
I've got this fire up all here.

01:41:29.456 --> 01:41:30.666 A:middle
I can move this over the back of

01:41:30.666 --> 01:41:31.006 A:middle
the ship.

01:41:31.006 --> 01:41:31.906 A:middle
But to make that look more

01:41:31.906 --> 01:41:33.886 A:middle
realistic, I need to apply blend

01:41:33.886 --> 01:41:34.096 A:middle
mode.

01:41:34.096 --> 01:41:35.796 A:middle
Now normally, blend modes is

01:41:35.796 --> 01:41:36.836 A:middle
something that takes a lot of

01:41:36.836 --> 01:41:37.376 A:middle
trial and error.

01:41:37.376 --> 01:41:38.816 A:middle
But now, look at this.

01:41:38.816 --> 01:41:40.166 A:middle
So I can just scrub down here

01:41:40.546 --> 01:41:42.036 A:middle
and I'll get an instant preview

01:41:42.036 --> 01:41:42.936 A:middle
of all the different blend

01:41:42.936 --> 01:41:43.106 A:middle
modes.

01:41:43.106 --> 01:41:44.036 A:middle
So it makes it really, really

01:41:44.036 --> 01:41:45.926 A:middle
easy to select the right blend

01:41:45.926 --> 01:41:47.256 A:middle
modes that I want.

01:41:47.256 --> 01:41:49.306 A:middle
Now of course, everything I've

01:41:49.306 --> 01:41:50.556 A:middle
done so far, I've done using

01:41:50.556 --> 01:41:50.956 A:middle
touch.

01:41:50.956 --> 01:41:52.606 A:middle
But with iPad Pro, we have the

01:41:52.656 --> 01:41:54.246 A:middle
best stylus that's ever been

01:41:54.246 --> 01:41:54.576 A:middle
made.

01:41:54.726 --> 01:41:56.256 A:middle
And we can do some great stuff

01:41:56.256 --> 01:41:57.326 A:middle
with Apple Pencil, too.

01:41:57.606 --> 01:41:59.196 A:middle
A really good example of that is

01:41:59.196 --> 01:42:00.206 A:middle
our lighting filter.

01:42:00.326 --> 01:42:01.556 A:middle
So here, I'll choose lighting,

01:42:02.446 --> 01:42:03.346 A:middle
and make that a bit bigger.

01:42:03.606 --> 01:42:04.936 A:middle
And look, I can actually control

01:42:04.936 --> 01:42:06.816 A:middle
now the angle and the tilt of

01:42:06.816 --> 01:42:08.866 A:middle
that light using Apple Pencil.

01:42:09.056 --> 01:42:10.576 A:middle
There's no latency, whatsoever.

01:42:10.576 --> 01:42:12.356 A:middle
So it's a really immersive way

01:42:12.806 --> 01:42:13.376 A:middle
to work.

01:42:13.376 --> 01:42:15.916 A:middle
Now, I said at the start, I was

01:42:15.916 --> 01:42:17.486 A:middle
creating a movie poster.

01:42:17.486 --> 01:42:18.576 A:middle
And in fact, what I'm actually

01:42:18.576 --> 01:42:19.926 A:middle
doing is creating a pirate movie

01:42:19.926 --> 01:42:20.316 A:middle
poster.

01:42:20.316 --> 01:42:21.436 A:middle
So now, I need a pirate.

01:42:21.946 --> 01:42:22.846 A:middle
And I've got Captain Jack

01:42:22.846 --> 01:42:23.506 A:middle
Sparrow here.

01:42:23.506 --> 01:42:25.256 A:middle
But at the moment, of course,

01:42:25.256 --> 01:42:26.616 A:middle
he's on the wrong background.

01:42:26.616 --> 01:42:27.666 A:middle
So what I need to do is cut him

01:42:27.666 --> 01:42:27.846 A:middle
out.

01:42:27.846 --> 01:42:28.666 A:middle
And I'm going to use some

01:42:28.666 --> 01:42:29.896 A:middle
selection tool to do that.

01:42:29.896 --> 01:42:30.646 A:middle
So, to start with, I'm just

01:42:30.646 --> 01:42:31.996 A:middle
going to do-- and you can see

01:42:31.996 --> 01:42:33.806 A:middle
how quick it is to do a really

01:42:33.996 --> 01:42:35.906 A:middle
quick selection with pencil to

01:42:35.906 --> 01:42:37.146 A:middle
sort of snap around the edges.

01:42:37.456 --> 01:42:38.496 A:middle
But of course, with selections,

01:42:38.496 --> 01:42:39.676 A:middle
what often happens is you need

01:42:39.676 --> 01:42:40.686 A:middle
to do a much more accurate

01:42:40.686 --> 01:42:41.726 A:middle
selection around hair.

01:42:41.726 --> 01:42:42.656 A:middle
And to do that, we're going to

01:42:42.656 --> 01:42:43.816 A:middle
do a selection refinement.

01:42:44.276 --> 01:42:45.226 A:middle
This is something that takes a

01:42:45.226 --> 01:42:47.266 A:middle
huge amount of CPU power, but on

01:42:47.266 --> 01:42:48.886 A:middle
this latest iPad, it's twice as

01:42:48.886 --> 01:42:49.946 A:middle
fast as ever before.

01:42:50.236 --> 01:42:51.266 A:middle
And you can see pretty much

01:42:51.306 --> 01:42:52.636 A:middle
instantly, I'll get a selection

01:42:52.636 --> 01:42:54.046 A:middle
down to individual strands of

01:42:54.046 --> 01:42:54.326 A:middle
hair.

[ Applause ]

01:43:00.106 --> 01:43:01.556 A:middle
And that's it, that's my poster

01:43:01.556 --> 01:43:03.496 A:middle
complete, a professional looking

01:43:03.496 --> 01:43:06.826 A:middle
poster created on a device that

01:43:06.826 --> 01:43:08.916 A:middle
I can hold in my hands.

01:43:08.916 --> 01:43:10.946 A:middle
It's really incredible.

01:43:11.116 --> 01:43:12.316 A:middle
I really think that iPad Pro,

01:43:12.366 --> 01:43:14.446 A:middle
alongside Affinity Photo, is a

01:43:14.446 --> 01:43:16.146 A:middle
truly game-changing experience

01:43:16.146 --> 01:43:17.376 A:middle
for professional photo editing.

01:43:17.376 --> 01:43:18.226 A:middle
And the best thing of all is

01:43:18.226 --> 01:43:19.646 A:middle
that you can now experience it

01:43:19.646 --> 01:43:21.436 A:middle
now, because I'm delighted to

01:43:21.546 --> 01:43:23.236 A:middle
announce that Affinity Photo for

01:43:23.286 --> 01:43:24.736 A:middle
iPad is available on the App

[ Applause and Cheering ]

01:43:31.996 --> 01:43:34.836 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Wow. Thank you, Ash.

01:43:34.876 --> 01:43:36.206 A:middle
That's amazing performance,

01:43:36.206 --> 01:43:37.436 A:middle
again, especially for a device

01:43:37.436 --> 01:43:38.956 A:middle
that's so thin and light in a

01:43:39.046 --> 01:43:40.226 A:middle
simple one-pound package you

01:43:40.226 --> 01:43:41.386 A:middle
could take with you everywhere

01:43:41.386 --> 01:43:41.816 A:middle
you go.

01:43:42.646 --> 01:43:44.056 A:middle
And what's also cool is despite

01:43:44.096 --> 01:43:45.486 A:middle
all this performance to new,

01:43:45.806 --> 01:43:48.036 A:middle
iPad Pro still delivers the same

01:43:48.086 --> 01:43:49.706 A:middle
all day 10-hour battery life

01:43:49.736 --> 01:43:50.996 A:middle
that our iPad users love.

01:43:51.446 --> 01:43:53.956 A:middle
Next, let's talk about cameras.

01:43:54.766 --> 01:43:56.896 A:middle
The new iPad Pro features the

01:43:56.896 --> 01:43:58.396 A:middle
latest camera system from our

01:43:58.396 --> 01:43:59.066 A:middle
iPhone 7.

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:00.536 A:middle
That means the same high

01:44:00.656 --> 01:44:03.396 A:middle
performance 12 megapixel sensor

01:44:03.676 --> 01:44:04.626 A:middle
with optical image

01:44:04.626 --> 01:44:05.466 A:middle
stabilization.

01:44:05.466 --> 01:44:07.376 A:middle
And it has the ability to even

01:44:07.706 --> 01:44:09.576 A:middle
capture and, of course, edit 4K

01:44:09.576 --> 01:44:10.816 A:middle
video on the go.

01:44:10.816 --> 01:44:12.016 A:middle
They're absolutely fantastic

01:44:12.016 --> 01:44:12.486 A:middle
cameras.

01:44:13.076 --> 01:44:14.196 A:middle
The front-facing cameras from

01:44:14.196 --> 01:44:15.636 A:middle
the iPhone 7 as well got all

01:44:15.636 --> 01:44:18.086 A:middle
these great features, like wide

01:44:18.086 --> 01:44:20.156 A:middle
color gamut capture, auto image

01:44:20.156 --> 01:44:21.506 A:middle
stabilization and the entire

01:44:21.506 --> 01:44:22.756 A:middle
display can light up to become

01:44:22.756 --> 01:44:24.666 A:middle
the world's brightest and

01:44:24.666 --> 01:44:26.156 A:middle
largest Retina flash.

01:44:27.046 --> 01:44:28.606 A:middle
We have great accessories as

01:44:28.606 --> 01:44:29.066 A:middle
well.

01:44:29.996 --> 01:44:32.696 A:middle
The iPad Pro supports USB 3,

01:44:33.006 --> 01:44:33.896 A:middle
which means that you're going to

01:44:33.896 --> 01:44:35.906 A:middle
get faster transfers with your

01:44:35.906 --> 01:44:37.276 A:middle
USB and SD camera adapters.

01:44:37.786 --> 01:44:40.346 A:middle
And this also-- We also support

01:44:40.346 --> 01:44:42.056 A:middle
fast charging, means any of our

01:44:42.116 --> 01:44:44.716 A:middle
USB-C charge adapters will now

01:44:44.716 --> 01:44:46.216 A:middle
allow you to charge at half the

01:44:46.286 --> 01:44:46.636 A:middle
time.

01:44:47.186 --> 01:44:50.106 A:middle
And we have great new Smart

01:44:50.106 --> 01:44:51.236 A:middle
covers we have available in

01:44:51.236 --> 01:44:52.486 A:middle
polyurethane and then we're

And of course because they're

This is the largest iOS release

for iPad we've ever done.

01:46:48.006 --> 01:46:50.046 A:middle
Now, it starts with the dock.

01:46:50.046 --> 01:46:51.416 A:middle
Now we all know that dock

01:46:51.416 --> 01:46:52.266 A:middle
hovering down there at the

01:46:52.266 --> 01:46:53.756 A:middle
bottom of the screen, it is more

01:46:53.756 --> 01:46:54.796 A:middle
powerful than ever.

01:46:54.796 --> 01:46:56.396 A:middle
You can fill it with apps.

01:46:56.976 --> 01:46:58.186 A:middle
On the right there's a

01:46:58.186 --> 01:47:00.146 A:middle
predictive area, figures out

01:47:00.146 --> 01:47:01.096 A:middle
what you're going to use next

01:47:01.096 --> 01:47:03.016 A:middle
including your continuity apps.

01:47:03.436 --> 01:47:05.126 A:middle
And now you can summon the dock

from anywhere right from the

bottom of the screen and use it

for switching apps just like

that.

01:47:11.066 --> 01:47:12.866 A:middle
And what's incredible is how

01:47:12.866 --> 01:47:14.516 A:middle
it's used for multitasking.

01:47:14.866 --> 01:47:16.396 A:middle
So now if you're in an app and

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:18.146 A:middle
you swipe up, we can pull an app

01:47:18.146 --> 01:47:21.676 A:middle
out just like that into Slide

apps into Split View, but what's

01:47:32.606 --> 01:47:34.306 A:middle
really cool is the new app

01:47:34.306 --> 01:47:35.906 A:middle

01:51:13.526 --> 01:51:15.686 A:middle
mail message, pick it up and

01:51:15.686 --> 01:51:17.936 A:middle
just drop it right into this

01:51:18.066 --> 01:51:19.976 A:middle
folder of top secret projects.

01:51:20.426 --> 01:51:22.426 A:middle
[ Applause ]

01:51:22.836 --> 01:51:24.466 A:middle
Now let's dive all the way in

01:51:24.466 --> 01:51:25.876 A:middle
and take a closer look at the

01:51:25.876 --> 01:51:27.036 A:middle
Files app.

01:51:27.116 --> 01:51:29.606 A:middle
We see it has this gorgeous grid

01:51:29.606 --> 01:51:31.536 A:middle
view but it also has a list view

01:51:31.536 --> 01:51:33.166 A:middle
that provides me all the details

01:51:33.166 --> 01:51:33.986 A:middle
about my files.

01:51:34.376 --> 01:51:36.096 A:middle
I can sort them by size or let's

01:51:36.226 --> 01:51:37.116 A:middle
sort by date.

01:51:37.476 --> 01:51:38.906 A:middle
Now I can create new folders.

01:51:38.906 --> 01:51:40.106 A:middle
So let's say I want to create an

01:51:40.176 --> 01:51:42.156 A:middle
R&amp;D folder right here.

01:51:42.156 --> 01:51:43.876 A:middle
I'm going to take some of my top

01:51:43.876 --> 01:51:46.396 A:middle
secret perspective projects and

01:51:46.396 --> 01:51:48.796 A:middle
I can do multi-select just like

01:51:48.796 --> 01:51:50.616 A:middle
this, drop them in.

01:51:51.046 --> 01:51:52.496 A:middle
Now I can also take the folder,

01:51:52.946 --> 01:51:54.336 A:middle
drag it right in to my

01:51:54.406 --> 01:51:54.796 A:middle
Favorites.

01:51:54.796 --> 01:51:56.426 A:middle
And these are synced across all

01:51:56.426 --> 01:51:57.316 A:middle
of my devices.

01:51:57.866 --> 01:52:00.036 A:middle
And if I want to tag a file, of

01:52:00.036 --> 01:52:01.466 A:middle
course I just drag it right on

01:52:01.466 --> 01:52:02.216 A:middle
there and make that one

01:52:02.646 --> 01:52:03.246 A:middle
important.

01:52:03.546 --> 01:52:04.896 A:middle
And you notice in addition to

01:52:04.946 --> 01:52:06.406 A:middle
iCloud here on the left, I have

01:52:06.406 --> 01:52:07.986 A:middle
access to all my cloud providers

01:52:07.986 --> 01:52:09.446 A:middle
like Box, so you can see I have

01:52:09.516 --> 01:52:11.246 A:middle
files here I'm using and folders

01:52:11.246 --> 01:52:11.876 A:middle
that I'm using for

01:52:11.876 --> 01:52:12.576 A:middle
collaboration.

01:52:12.736 --> 01:52:14.346 A:middle
And that includes this drone

01:52:14.346 --> 01:52:16.546 A:middle
defense proposal right here,

01:52:17.396 --> 01:52:18.066 A:middle
presentation.

01:52:18.216 --> 01:52:19.216 A:middle
And I want to show you when I go

01:52:19.216 --> 01:52:21.246 A:middle
into the Recents view from the

01:52:21.246 --> 01:52:22.986 A:middle
tab at the bottom, notice again

01:52:22.986 --> 01:52:24.306 A:middle
I view across everything

01:52:24.306 --> 01:52:25.866 A:middle
including that one inside the

01:52:25.906 --> 01:52:26.766 A:middle
Box.

01:52:26.766 --> 01:52:29.196 A:middle
I'm going to tap into that

01:52:29.196 --> 01:52:30.576 A:middle
keynote presentation and for my

01:52:30.646 --> 01:52:32.216 A:middle
final act, I want to show you

01:52:32.216 --> 01:52:33.686 A:middle
how I can use files directly

01:52:33.686 --> 01:52:35.756 A:middle
from the dock, just swipe up.

01:52:36.026 --> 01:52:38.136 A:middle
If I tap and hold, I get access

01:52:38.136 --> 01:52:39.706 A:middle
to my recent assets.

01:52:40.136 --> 01:52:43.466 A:middle
I can just pick this up, drop it

01:52:43.466 --> 01:52:44.896 A:middle
down just like that.

01:52:45.366 --> 01:52:46.946 A:middle
And that is a quick demo of our

01:52:47.016 --> 01:52:48.026 A:middle
productivity features on iPad.

01:52:49.516 --> 01:52:51.886 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheering ]

01:52:52.386 --> 01:52:54.966 A:middle
Now, next I want to talk about

01:52:55.126 --> 01:52:56.636 A:middle
Apple Pencil, because Apple

01:52:56.636 --> 01:52:58.226 A:middle
Pencil has really created a

01:52:58.226 --> 01:53:00.056 A:middle
whole new way of working on

01:53:00.056 --> 01:53:00.386 A:middle
iPad.

01:53:00.386 --> 01:53:02.226 A:middle
And with iOS 11, we've

01:53:02.286 --> 01:53:03.976 A:middle
integrated it deeply into the

01:53:03.976 --> 01:53:04.476 A:middle
system.

01:53:04.916 --> 01:53:06.116 A:middle
Now it starts with markup,

01:53:06.116 --> 01:53:07.806 A:middle
because you can mark up anything

01:53:07.806 --> 01:53:08.646 A:middle
you can Quick Look.

01:53:09.156 --> 01:53:10.716 A:middle
You can take Safari content,

01:53:10.956 --> 01:53:12.456 A:middle
recreate it into a continuous

01:53:12.456 --> 01:53:14.426 A:middle
scrolling view that you can mark

01:53:14.426 --> 01:53:14.756 A:middle
up.

01:53:14.756 --> 01:53:15.736 A:middle
And you can actually do this

01:53:15.736 --> 01:53:17.136 A:middle
with any app that supports

01:53:17.206 --> 01:53:18.256 A:middle
printing, because we have a

01:53:18.256 --> 01:53:20.206 A:middle
create PDF option that will

01:53:20.206 --> 01:53:21.986 A:middle
create a markup PDF, it's a

01:53:21.986 --> 01:53:24.036 A:middle
really great way to mark up

01:53:24.036 --> 01:53:25.536 A:middle
anything and share it.

01:53:25.836 --> 01:53:26.916 A:middle
We know, a lot of people do like

01:53:26.916 --> 01:53:29.076 A:middle
to share with screenshots, and

01:53:29.106 --> 01:53:30.056 A:middle
so now when you take a

01:53:30.056 --> 01:53:31.786 A:middle
screenshot, we'll create a

01:53:31.786 --> 01:53:33.036 A:middle
thumbnail down in the bottom of

01:53:33.036 --> 01:53:33.306 A:middle
the screen.

01:53:33.306 --> 01:53:35.356 A:middle
If you tap it, you go instantly

01:53:35.356 --> 01:53:37.506 A:middle
in the markup, you can mark it

01:53:37.506 --> 01:53:39.356 A:middle
up right there and share it.

01:53:39.846 --> 01:53:41.746 A:middle
Now, we've all-- It's really

01:53:41.746 --> 01:53:41.926 A:middle
cool.

[ Applause ]

01:53:46.086 --> 01:53:47.356 A:middle
Now, we've also integrated

01:53:47.356 --> 01:53:49.646 A:middle
Pencil deeply into Notes.

01:53:49.796 --> 01:53:51.076 A:middle
So if you're working on a note

01:53:51.076 --> 01:53:52.216 A:middle
and later you're at the lock

01:53:52.216 --> 01:53:53.216 A:middle

01:53:53.216 --> 01:53:54.806 A:middle
just a tap of the pencil to lock

01:53:54.806 --> 01:53:56.616 A:middle

01:53:56.616 --> 01:53:57.386 A:middle
your note.

01:53:57.686 --> 01:53:58.726 A:middle
And we've made your note

01:53:58.966 --> 01:54:01.026 A:middle
handwritten text searchable.

01:54:01.026 --> 01:54:02.476 A:middle
So we can now search handwriting

01:54:02.476 --> 01:54:03.616 A:middle
and we use deep learning to

01:54:03.616 --> 01:54:05.096 A:middle
recognize what you write.

01:54:05.896 --> 01:54:07.936 A:middle
And if you're doing primarily

01:54:08.016 --> 01:54:10.006 A:middle
typed notes, you can now also do

01:54:10.006 --> 01:54:12.236 A:middle
inline drawings, right there.

01:54:12.236 --> 01:54:15.306 A:middle

[ Applause ]

01:54:18.076 --> 01:54:19.286 A:middle
Now of course, sometimes we

01:54:19.336 --> 01:54:20.596 A:middle
still have to deal with paper,

01:54:20.866 --> 01:54:22.596 A:middle
so Notes now has a built-in

01:54:22.666 --> 01:54:23.796 A:middle
document scanner.

01:54:23.796 --> 01:54:25.756 A:middle
It can correct perspective and

01:54:25.756 --> 01:54:26.456 A:middle
contrast.

01:54:28.006 --> 01:54:29.166 A:middle
And when you bring the note in,

01:54:30.346 --> 01:54:31.616 A:middle
you can mark it up, write with

01:54:31.656 --> 01:54:31.976 A:middle
your pencil.

personalize your mail messages

with the inline drawings.

Well, the first thing I want to

01:54:59.306 --> 01:55:01.046 A:middle
show you is a quick way of

01:55:01.046 --> 01:55:03.026 A:middle
getting to your notes using your

01:55:03.026 --> 01:55:03.726 A:middle
Apple Pencil.

01:55:04.736 --> 01:55:06.206 A:middle
You just tap on the lock screen

like this and it slides up to

01:55:08.566 --> 01:55:10.136 A:middle
reveal your notes beneath it.

01:55:10.726 --> 01:55:11.856 A:middle
Now you can see here I've got a

01:55:12.046 --> 01:55:13.546 A:middle
handwritten note and I want to

01:55:13.546 --> 01:55:14.936 A:middle
show you how easy it is to

01:55:14.936 --> 01:55:17.036 A:middle
create one of these.

01:55:17.036 --> 01:55:18.206 A:middle
Watch at the top of the note

01:55:18.206 --> 01:55:19.556 A:middle
here as I edit the title.

01:55:19.916 --> 01:55:21.356 A:middle

2017 keynote.

01:55:30.216 --> 01:55:31.526 A:middle
It's as natural as putting

01:55:31.526 --> 01:55:32.576 A:middle
pencil to paper.

01:55:33.156 --> 01:55:34.626 A:middle
Now something paper can't help

you with is finding your notes

01:55:35.986 --> 01:55:36.776 A:middle
again later.

recognize your handwriting and

index it in Spotlight.

01:55:42.936 --> 01:55:44.316 A:middle
Let's switch into Spotlight now

01:55:44.316 --> 01:55:45.906 A:middle
and we'll search for that text

01:55:45.986 --> 01:55:47.126 A:middle
that I just wrote down.

01:55:47.816 --> 01:55:48.746 A:middle
You can see here I've got the

01:55:48.746 --> 01:55:50.306 A:middle
new flick keyboard which makes

different note now, because I

01:56:11.846 --> 01:56:13.066 A:middle
want to show you how you can mix

01:56:13.066 --> 01:56:15.116 A:middle

This is a note that my young

01:56:19.476 --> 01:56:20.826 A:middle
daughter shared with me as part

01:56:20.826 --> 01:56:22.826 A:middle
of a school assignment where she

01:56:22.826 --> 01:56:24.086 A:middle
had to work with her parents to

01:56:24.086 --> 01:56:26.056 A:middle
develop an idea for a new app.

01:56:26.696 --> 01:56:27.886 A:middle
Now, she asked me how many

01:56:27.886 --> 01:56:29.346 A:middle
copies of our app I thought I

01:56:29.346 --> 01:56:31.376 A:middle
might sell-- We might sell.

01:56:31.376 --> 01:56:32.976 A:middle
And so, I want to quickly draw a

01:56:32.976 --> 01:56:35.056 A:middle
graph to give her some idea of

01:56:35.056 --> 01:56:35.146 A:middle
that.

01:56:35.146 --> 01:56:36.986 A:middle
I'm just going to press down

01:56:36.986 --> 01:56:38.116 A:middle
here with the pencil to make

01:56:38.116 --> 01:56:40.576 A:middle
some space for my drawing and

01:56:40.576 --> 01:56:41.536 A:middle
then we can take that little

01:56:41.536 --> 01:56:43.446 A:middle
grabber and open up some more

01:56:43.446 --> 01:56:43.696 A:middle
room.

01:56:44.066 --> 01:56:46.696 A:middle
Now, I am really bad at drawing

01:56:46.796 --> 01:56:48.406 A:middle
but I just love doing it.

01:56:48.776 --> 01:56:50.026 A:middle
And what's great about drawing

01:56:50.026 --> 01:56:51.956 A:middle
on the iPad is it works the same

01:56:51.956 --> 01:56:53.376 A:middle
way as it does with paper.

01:56:53.376 --> 01:56:55.286 A:middle
And that means it's really easy

01:56:55.396 --> 01:56:56.986 A:middle

Watch. I'm just going to put the

01:57:01.966 --> 01:57:03.986 A:middle
pencil down and just like that,

01:57:05.536 --> 01:57:05.996 A:middle
zoom.

01:57:06.486 --> 01:57:07.936 A:middle
It's so simple, and I think

01:57:07.936 --> 01:57:09.376 A:middle
you're going to have a lot of

01:57:09.376 --> 01:57:10.916 A:middle

01:57:11.966 --> 01:57:13.476 A:middle
But let's move on now.

01:57:13.876 --> 01:57:15.926 A:middle
So, my daughter's learned a few

01:57:15.996 --> 01:57:17.266 A:middle
things from me about how Apple

01:57:17.266 --> 01:57:17.646 A:middle
works.

01:57:17.646 --> 01:57:19.066 A:middle
And before I left this morning,

01:57:19.276 --> 01:57:21.106 A:middle
she gave me an NDA to sign.

01:57:22.146 --> 01:57:24.896 A:middle
I'm going to use the new

01:57:24.896 --> 01:57:26.616 A:middle
document scanner notes and my

01:57:26.616 --> 01:57:28.566 A:middle
pencil to take care of that in a

01:57:28.566 --> 01:57:29.106 A:middle

01:57:29.106 --> 01:57:31.216 A:middle
We'll just tap the plus button

01:57:31.216 --> 01:57:32.456 A:middle
here to bring up the document

01:57:32.456 --> 01:57:34.536 A:middle
scanner and all I need to do is

01:57:34.536 --> 01:57:36.336 A:middle
point the camera at the piece of

01:57:36.336 --> 01:57:36.876 A:middle
paper.

01:57:37.366 --> 01:57:38.576 A:middle

01:57:38.576 --> 01:57:40.826 A:middle
automatically, even straighten

01:57:40.826 --> 01:57:41.806 A:middle

We'll open it up full screen

01:57:43.186 --> 01:57:44.866 A:middle
here and I just fill in the

01:57:44.866 --> 01:57:46.096 A:middle
blanks with my pencil.

01:57:48.436 --> 01:57:50.566 A:middle
And just like that, I've got a

01:57:54.736 --> 01:57:56.126 A:middle
Now I see my daughter sent me a

01:57:56.126 --> 01:57:57.376 A:middle
message and it must be pretty

01:57:57.376 --> 01:57:58.676 A:middle

Wow, an offer for $100 million

01:58:06.506 --> 01:58:07.916 A:middle

02:05:29.836 --> 02:05:32.086 A:middle
in our pockets, HomePod is going

02:05:32.086 --> 02:05:34.736 A:middle
to reinvent music in our homes.

02:05:35.766 --> 02:05:36.796 A:middle
So let's talk about these

02:05:36.796 --> 02:05:37.166 A:middle
features.

02:05:37.166 --> 02:05:38.866 A:middle
First, rock the house.

02:05:39.656 --> 02:05:41.526 A:middle
The HomePod is just under 7

02:05:41.526 --> 02:05:42.676 A:middle
inches tall.

02:05:43.396 --> 02:05:45.436 A:middle
It's covered in a seamless 3D

02:05:45.436 --> 02:05:46.826 A:middle
mesh fabric that has incredible

02:05:46.826 --> 02:05:48.736 A:middle
acoustic properties, and it

02:05:48.736 --> 02:05:51.176 A:middle
hides within it amazing audio

02:05:51.176 --> 02:05:51.926 A:middle
technology.

02:05:53.026 --> 02:05:56.546 A:middle
For example, along the bottom is

02:05:56.786 --> 02:06:00.266 A:middle
a 7 array beam-formed tweeter

02:06:00.266 --> 02:06:01.636 A:middle
pack that's packed with seven

02:06:01.636 --> 02:06:03.216 A:middle
tweeters, each with their own

02:06:03.216 --> 02:06:04.386 A:middle
individual driver.

02:06:04.856 --> 02:06:06.706 A:middle
They're precision acoustic horns

02:06:07.086 --> 02:06:09.126 A:middle
that drive the audio from within

02:06:09.126 --> 02:06:10.736 A:middle
and then out along the bottom

02:06:10.936 --> 02:06:12.306 A:middle
with tremendous directional

02:06:12.346 --> 02:06:12.946 A:middle
control.

02:06:12.946 --> 02:06:14.216 A:middle
And that will become really

02:06:14.216 --> 02:06:15.586 A:middle
clear in a bit as we talk about

02:06:15.586 --> 02:06:16.016 A:middle
how it works.

02:06:17.316 --> 02:06:18.936 A:middle
It has a really big woofer,

02:06:18.936 --> 02:06:20.916 A:middle
4-inch woofer upward facing with

02:06:20.916 --> 02:06:22.276 A:middle
a large motor to move a lot of

02:06:22.276 --> 02:06:22.676 A:middle
air.

02:06:22.676 --> 02:06:23.946 A:middle
It has automatic bass

02:06:23.946 --> 02:06:25.426 A:middle
equalization and dynamic

02:06:25.426 --> 02:06:26.756 A:middle
software modeling so that as we

02:06:26.756 --> 02:06:28.536 A:middle
turn the volume up, it's free

02:06:28.536 --> 02:06:29.356 A:middle
from distortion.

02:06:30.466 --> 02:06:32.886 A:middle
And all of this is controlled by

02:06:32.886 --> 02:06:34.476 A:middle
an Apple A8 chip.

02:06:34.476 --> 02:06:37.146 A:middle
Yes, the same chip that powers

02:06:37.146 --> 02:06:39.506 A:middle
the inside of our iPhone is

02:06:39.506 --> 02:06:40.656 A:middle
inside HomePod.

02:06:41.016 --> 02:06:42.596 A:middle
It's perhaps the biggest brain

02:06:42.596 --> 02:06:44.566 A:middle
ever in a speaker, and it does

02:06:44.566 --> 02:06:45.626 A:middle
some incredible things.

02:06:46.516 --> 02:06:50.916 A:middle
[ Applause and Cheering ]

02:06:56.966 --> 02:06:58.086 A:middle
You don't have to know any of

02:06:58.086 --> 02:06:59.116 A:middle
that, is just know that it

02:06:59.226 --> 02:07:00.896 A:middle
sounds incredible.

02:07:01.336 --> 02:07:07.496 A:middle
Next, we talk about this spatial

02:07:07.496 --> 02:07:07.946 A:middle
awareness.

02:07:07.946 --> 02:07:08.766 A:middle
Well, what does that mean?

02:07:08.766 --> 02:07:10.686 A:middle
Well, you plug in your HomePod

02:07:10.686 --> 02:07:11.986 A:middle
to AC and it gets its music

02:07:12.056 --> 02:07:12.766 A:middle
wirelessly.

02:07:13.246 --> 02:07:14.446 A:middle
And it's compact enough that you

02:07:14.446 --> 02:07:15.586 A:middle
can put it mostly anywhere in

02:07:15.586 --> 02:07:16.036 A:middle
your house.

02:07:16.036 --> 02:07:17.396 A:middle
You can put it on a table, on a

02:07:17.396 --> 02:07:19.056 A:middle
shelf, against the wall, in a

02:07:19.056 --> 02:07:21.566 A:middle
corner and it intelligently and

02:07:21.566 --> 02:07:23.906 A:middle
automatically detects the spaces

02:07:23.906 --> 02:07:24.316 A:middle
within.

02:07:24.316 --> 02:07:27.476 A:middle
And it uses that information to

02:07:27.476 --> 02:07:29.246 A:middle
adjust the audio, to balance it,

02:07:29.286 --> 02:07:30.846 A:middle
and take full advantage of the

02:07:30.846 --> 02:07:31.936 A:middle
environment and create a very

02:07:31.936 --> 02:07:33.106 A:middle
spacious sound.

02:07:34.406 --> 02:07:35.576 A:middle
Now, we want to give you a sense

02:07:35.576 --> 02:07:37.076 A:middle
of what that experience is like.

02:07:37.636 --> 02:07:39.286 A:middle
So we want to play some music in

02:07:39.286 --> 02:07:41.536 A:middle
this room and show you a visual

02:07:41.536 --> 02:07:43.376 A:middle
simulation to give you an

02:07:43.376 --> 02:07:44.536 A:middle
understanding of some of the

02:07:44.536 --> 02:07:46.006 A:middle
technologies it's using and how

02:07:46.006 --> 02:07:47.646 A:middle
it's adopting them to make

02:07:47.776 --> 02:07:49.116 A:middle
incredible sound, on this

compact speaker.

02:07:50.146 --> 02:07:51.956 A:middle
So I'm going to start by playing

02:07:51.956 --> 02:07:53.736 A:middle
an audio track and it will be a

02:07:53.736 --> 02:07:54.906 A:middle
full mix and then I'm going to

02:07:54.906 --> 02:07:55.846 A:middle
break it down to some of the

02:07:55.846 --> 02:07:57.916 A:middle
components that the HomePod

02:07:57.916 --> 02:07:58.546 A:middle
controls.

So that's a full rich audio mix

02:08:17.856 --> 02:08:19.466 A:middle
but within it, HomePod detects

02:08:19.636 --> 02:08:21.326 A:middle
the center vocals and can use

02:08:21.406 --> 02:08:22.606 A:middle
beam-forming to direct that.

And then it can detect something

02:08:34.096 --> 02:08:35.496 A:middle
called direct energy with the

02:08:35.496 --> 02:08:37.336 A:middle

In addition to that direct

02:08:49.986 --> 02:08:51.516 A:middle
energy, there's something that's

02:08:51.516 --> 02:08:52.656 A:middle
usually missing in music,

02:08:52.746 --> 02:08:55.056 A:middle

list of commands.

02:11:18.526 --> 02:11:19.816 A:middle

02:11:24.586 --> 02:11:26.696 A:middle
to just sit next to the HomePod

02:11:26.696 --> 02:11:27.426 A:middle
to talk to it.

02:11:27.426 --> 02:11:29.446 A:middle

rock the house in a spatial

02:11:42.116 --> 02:11:43.476 A:middle

the rooms we place it within.

02:11:45.306 --> 02:11:47.736 A:middle
And it has the fun interactivity

02:11:47.736 --> 02:11:49.686 A:middle
of Siri becoming a musicologist

02:11:49.836 --> 02:11:51.176 A:middle
and helping us to listen to the

music we love.

02:11:51.976 --> 02:11:53.866 A:middle
And since Siri is built in there

02:11:53.866 --> 02:11:55.366 A:middle
and you can speak to it, well,

02:11:55.366 --> 02:11:56.546 A:middle
the team has also worked hard to

02:11:56.546 --> 02:11:58.476 A:middle
make it a great and helpful home

02:11:58.476 --> 02:11:59.836 A:middle

02:11:59.966 --> 02:12:03.316 A:middle
We said the domain of music is

02:12:03.316 --> 02:12:04.636 A:middle
something Siri knows really well

02:12:04.636 --> 02:12:05.226 A:middle
in HomePod.

02:12:05.296 --> 02:12:07.096 A:middle
There are other domains as well.

02:12:07.256 --> 02:12:08.176 A:middle
We've worked hard to pick the

02:12:08.396 --> 02:12:09.706 A:middle
first ones that we think matter

02:12:09.706 --> 02:12:11.346 A:middle
most in a product like HomePod,

02:12:11.346 --> 02:12:12.636 A:middle
so of course, it can play your

02:12:12.636 --> 02:12:13.266 A:middle
podcasts.

02:12:13.266 --> 02:12:15.386 A:middle
But it can also do things like

02:12:15.736 --> 02:12:17.626 A:middle
give you news, give you weather,

02:12:17.626 --> 02:12:18.896 A:middle
traffic, sports.

02:12:18.896 --> 02:12:20.206 A:middle
You can ask it to set a

02:12:20.206 --> 02:12:23.286 A:middle
reminder, set a timer, text

02:12:23.286 --> 02:12:24.486 A:middle
someone with messages.

02:12:24.876 --> 02:12:26.436 A:middle
And if you have HomeKit devices

02:12:26.436 --> 02:12:27.446 A:middle
set up in your home, you can

02:12:27.446 --> 02:12:28.776 A:middle
speak to your HomePod and

02:12:28.776 --> 02:12:30.506 A:middle
control your HomeKit devices.

02:12:31.176 --> 02:12:34.716 A:middle
So for example, for the HomePod

02:12:34.716 --> 02:12:36.636 A:middle
set up, you can say, "When do

02:12:36.636 --> 02:12:37.956 A:middle
the Red Sox play next?"

02:12:38.046 --> 02:12:39.096 A:middle
They're going to beat the

02:12:39.096 --> 02:12:39.966 A:middle
Yankees, trust me.

02:12:40.696 --> 02:12:43.836 A:middle
Tune to NPR instead, flip a

02:12:43.836 --> 02:12:45.596 A:middle
coin, remind me to bring snacks

02:12:45.596 --> 02:12:46.226 A:middle
to a party.

02:12:46.806 --> 02:12:49.106 A:middle
You can set up reminders, check

02:12:49.106 --> 02:12:50.646 A:middle
all the sports news and weather,

02:12:51.006 --> 02:12:52.416 A:middle
all directly with your voice,

02:12:52.656 --> 02:12:53.846 A:middle
talk to a HomePod that gets the

02:12:53.846 --> 02:12:55.496 A:middle
information directly from the

02:12:55.496 --> 02:12:55.926 A:middle
cloud.

02:12:55.996 --> 02:12:58.196 A:middle
And if you have HomeKit devices

02:12:58.196 --> 02:12:59.826 A:middle
set up, you can say simple

02:12:59.826 --> 02:13:01.556 A:middle
things like, are the lights on,

02:13:01.896 --> 02:13:03.776 A:middle
turn the heat up, turn on the

02:13:03.776 --> 02:13:05.396 A:middle
air conditioning, bring the

02:13:05.396 --> 02:13:08.026 A:middle
shades down halfway, turn off

02:13:08.026 --> 02:13:09.456 A:middle
the lights in the bedroom.

02:13:10.076 --> 02:13:11.466 A:middle
And if you've set up scenes in

02:13:11.466 --> 02:13:12.736 A:middle
HomeKit you can control those as

02:13:12.736 --> 02:13:13.146 A:middle
well.

02:13:13.356 --> 02:13:14.696 A:middle
You can say, "I'm home.

02:13:15.146 --> 02:13:16.036 A:middle
It's movie time.

02:13:16.036 --> 02:13:17.466 A:middle
I'm leaving now."

02:13:17.466 --> 02:13:18.696 A:middle
And the whole scene can

02:13:18.696 --> 02:13:20.996 A:middle
automatically happen just by

02:13:20.996 --> 02:13:22.316 A:middle
talking to your HomePod.

02:13:23.126 --> 02:13:26.366 A:middle
And because there is a HomePod

02:13:26.366 --> 02:13:27.756 A:middle
base-- the HomeKit base built

02:13:27.756 --> 02:13:29.446 A:middle
into HomePod, that means

02:13:29.446 --> 02:13:30.896 A:middle
anywhere in the world, once you

02:13:30.896 --> 02:13:32.286 A:middle
set up your first HomePod, you

02:13:32.286 --> 02:13:34.116 A:middle
control your HomeKit devices

02:13:34.116 --> 02:13:35.906 A:middle
remotely using the built-in Home

02:13:35.906 --> 02:13:38.066 A:middle
app on your iPhone or iPad.

02:13:38.066 --> 02:13:41.266 A:middle
Now, setting up a HomePod and

02:13:41.266 --> 02:13:42.886 A:middle
its microphone array in your

02:13:42.886 --> 02:13:44.016 A:middle
home, you probably have a

02:13:44.016 --> 02:13:44.926 A:middle
question that we've worked

02:13:45.306 --> 02:13:46.736 A:middle
really hard to deal with, which

02:13:46.736 --> 02:13:47.706 A:middle
is privacy.

02:13:48.046 --> 02:13:49.916 A:middle
Our team cares deeply about your

02:13:49.916 --> 02:13:50.686 A:middle
privacy.

02:13:51.106 --> 02:13:52.996 A:middle
So for example, it has that

02:13:52.996 --> 02:13:54.456 A:middle
magic phrase, hey Siri.

02:13:54.656 --> 02:13:56.776 A:middle
Until you say it, nothing is

02:13:56.776 --> 02:13:57.626 A:middle
being sent to Apple.

02:13:58.866 --> 02:14:00.756 A:middle
It recognizes when you do say it

02:14:00.756 --> 02:14:02.056 A:middle
and from that point it sends an

02:14:02.086 --> 02:14:04.366 A:middle
anonymous Siri ID in order to

02:14:04.366 --> 02:14:05.496 A:middle
help you with the command you're

02:14:05.496 --> 02:14:06.116 A:middle
looking for.

02:14:06.116 --> 02:14:07.936 A:middle
And of course that communication

02:14:08.246 --> 02:14:09.436 A:middle
is all encrypted.

02:14:09.906 --> 02:14:12.406 A:middle
So this is the HomePod.

02:14:12.846 --> 02:14:14.106 A:middle
It's a breakthrough home

02:14:14.106 --> 02:14:14.926 A:middle
speaker.

02:14:16.256 --> 02:14:18.176 A:middle
Typically Wi-Fi speakers, if

02:14:18.176 --> 02:14:20.756 A:middle
they're a good quality, of $300

02:14:20.756 --> 02:14:22.936 A:middle
to $500.

02:14:22.936 --> 02:14:24.306 A:middle
And a smart speaker might cost

02:14:24.306 --> 02:14:26.306 A:middle
you $100 to $200.

02:14:27.126 --> 02:14:28.256 A:middle
So it's not unreasonable for a

02:14:28.256 --> 02:14:29.396 A:middle
HomePod to be priced in the

02:14:29.396 --> 02:14:32.266 A:middle
range of $400 to $700.

02:14:33.086 --> 02:14:34.666 A:middle
So we're really excited to tell

02:14:34.666 --> 02:14:36.546 A:middle
you that HomePod is going to be

02:14:36.546 --> 02:14:38.976 A:middle
priced for $349.

bringing it around the world.

02:14:57.906 --> 02:14:59.166 A:middle

It is so cool.

02:15:09.186 --> 02:15:11.206 A:middle
We really believe it's going to

02:15:11.206 --> 02:15:13.276 A:middle
take your home music experience

things this morning and all of

others at the end of the year.

02:15:33.246 --> 02:15:35.666 A:middle
We got started with watchOS,

healthier life.

02:15:43.666 --> 02:15:46.236 A:middle
macOS High Sierra, great

02:15:46.236 --> 02:15:48.156 A:middle
refinements in technology that

02:15:48.156 --> 02:15:51.216 A:middle
will push the macOS experience

forward.

02:15:52.236 --> 02:15:56.056 A:middle
