00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:16.500 A:middle
[ Cheers ]

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:24.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; You have a global audience,

00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:26.816 A:middle
the world is increasingly

00:00:26.816 --> 00:00:29.906 A:middle
interconnected, people travel

00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:32.106 A:middle
and when they do they use apps

00:00:32.176 --> 00:00:33.496 A:middle
to orient themselves in new

00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:35.396 A:middle
places and figure out what to

00:00:35.396 --> 00:00:37.796 A:middle
do, where to eat and how to get

00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:38.256 A:middle
around.

00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:42.206 A:middle
And people move for all sorts of

00:00:42.206 --> 00:00:44.336 A:middle
reasons, so in any given place

00:00:44.476 --> 00:00:45.906 A:middle
you're likely to find people

00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:47.136 A:middle
from different countries,

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:49.476 A:middle
cultures and language groups.

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:53.916 A:middle
And here at WWDC, we are part of

00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:56.126 A:middle
a group representing 75

00:00:56.126 --> 00:00:57.106 A:middle
different countries.

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:01.986 A:middle
So why design for this global

00:01:01.986 --> 00:01:02.496 A:middle
audience?

00:01:03.836 --> 00:01:06.286 A:middle
First and most importantly, for

00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:08.146 A:middle
a better user experience.

00:01:08.706 --> 00:01:09.986 A:middle
Language and symbols are

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:12.186 A:middle
grounded in cultural context so

00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:14.006 A:middle
not all of us interpret things

00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:14.916 A:middle
in the same way.

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:16.986 A:middle
It's important of course, to

00:01:16.986 --> 00:01:18.236 A:middle
make sure that your words and

00:01:18.306 --> 00:01:19.676 A:middle
artwork aren't offensive to your

00:01:19.676 --> 00:01:21.936 A:middle
users, but don't stop there.

00:01:22.676 --> 00:01:23.916 A:middle
Carefully considering your

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:25.886 A:middle
global audience can help make

00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:28.046 A:middle
your app as useful and appealing

00:01:28.346 --> 00:01:29.936 A:middle
to as many people as possible.

00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:33.166 A:middle
And thinking this way sets you

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:33.636 A:middle
up to grow.

00:01:34.536 --> 00:01:35.856 A:middle
The App Store is available

00:01:35.856 --> 00:01:38.146 A:middle
around the world so people from

00:01:38.256 --> 00:01:39.616 A:middle
any country that you've enabled

00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:41.546 A:middle
in iTunes Connect can view and

00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:43.046 A:middle
download your app.

00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:44.786 A:middle
Whether your app is only in one

00:01:44.786 --> 00:01:46.176 A:middle
language right now or you're

00:01:46.176 --> 00:01:48.226 A:middle
already in multiple markets the

00:01:48.226 --> 00:01:49.946 A:middle
principles we'll discuss are

00:01:49.946 --> 00:01:51.336 A:middle
relevant to you no matter what.

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:53.696 A:middle
So, let's get started.

00:01:54.636 --> 00:01:56.436 A:middle
First, make a plan.

00:01:57.386 --> 00:01:58.626 A:middle
Think about your strategic

00:01:58.626 --> 00:02:00.546 A:middle
goals, which countries and

00:02:00.546 --> 00:02:01.806 A:middle
languages are next on your

00:02:01.806 --> 00:02:03.496 A:middle
roadmap, if you have one

00:02:03.496 --> 00:02:05.146 A:middle
already, and don't forget to

00:02:05.196 --> 00:02:06.146 A:middle
take a look at your app

00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:07.936 A:middle
analytics in iTunes Connect

00:02:08.356 --> 00:02:09.826 A:middle
that's some useful information,

00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:11.016 A:middle
you might find something there

00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:11.936 A:middle
that's surprising.

00:02:13.206 --> 00:02:15.686 A:middle
Next, identify your user groups

00:02:16.576 --> 00:02:17.866 A:middle
and think about how best to

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:19.106 A:middle
communicate with them.

00:02:19.616 --> 00:02:21.076 A:middle
Can you get by with some minor

00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:22.246 A:middle
changes to your app.

00:02:22.676 --> 00:02:24.486 A:middle
Is it time to think seriously

00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:26.416 A:middle
about a major localization

00:02:26.656 --> 00:02:27.076 A:middle
effort.

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:29.336 A:middle
Use this information to

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:30.826 A:middle
prioritize your important

00:02:30.826 --> 00:02:32.706 A:middle
localization work and think

00:02:32.706 --> 00:02:34.276 A:middle
about ways to streamline.

00:02:35.226 --> 00:02:36.736 A:middle
Make sure that you have

00:02:36.736 --> 00:02:38.476 A:middle
translations for your key terms

00:02:38.476 --> 00:02:40.286 A:middle
before you need them and if

00:02:40.286 --> 00:02:41.746 A:middle
you're going to have a second

00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:43.526 A:middle
set of artwork for example for a

00:02:43.526 --> 00:02:45.326 A:middle
different market get it all done

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:47.676 A:middle
at the same time.

00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:49.836 A:middle
So, let's discuss some key

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.596 A:middle
considerations related to

00:02:51.596 --> 00:02:52.276 A:middle
language.

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:55.756 A:middle
When terms can be used more or

00:02:55.756 --> 00:02:57.266 A:middle
less interchangeably in your

00:02:57.266 --> 00:02:59.786 A:middle
app's primary language is there

00:02:59.786 --> 00:03:01.576 A:middle
one choice that's very similar

00:03:01.576 --> 00:03:02.916 A:middle
to other languages.

00:03:03.506 --> 00:03:05.236 A:middle
For example, picture and photo

00:03:05.236 --> 00:03:06.746 A:middle
are more or less the same in

00:03:06.746 --> 00:03:07.726 A:middle
English, but look at the

00:03:07.726 --> 00:03:08.976 A:middle
difference in these other

00:03:08.976 --> 00:03:09.746 A:middle
languages.

00:03:09.796 --> 00:03:13.676 A:middle
Photo is the clear winner for

00:03:13.676 --> 00:03:14.966 A:middle
multilingual clarity.

00:03:15.616 --> 00:03:19.846 A:middle
If you have the resources to

00:03:19.846 --> 00:03:22.106 A:middle
fully translate your app go for

00:03:22.696 --> 00:03:24.846 A:middle
it, but if not prioritize.

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:27.296 A:middle
Help your users orient

00:03:27.296 --> 00:03:28.796 A:middle
themselves with headings and

00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:29.296 A:middle
titles.

00:03:30.926 --> 00:03:32.266 A:middle
Make sure that the important

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:33.256 A:middle
information from your

00:03:33.336 --> 00:03:35.206 A:middle
instructions is conveyed and

00:03:36.346 --> 00:03:38.076 A:middle
that commonly used terms are

00:03:38.076 --> 00:03:38.436 A:middle
clear.

00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:41.526 A:middle
Finally, make sure that users

00:03:41.526 --> 00:03:43.436 A:middle
can read error messages just in

00:03:43.436 --> 00:03:45.406 A:middle
case something goes wrong.

00:03:47.056 --> 00:03:49.576 A:middle
Think about informal language

00:03:49.576 --> 00:03:49.906 A:middle
too.

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:52.876 A:middle
You may choose to include slang,

00:03:53.306 --> 00:03:55.306 A:middle
very informal words or phrases

00:03:55.826 --> 00:03:57.656 A:middle
or figures of speech, words or

00:03:57.656 --> 00:03:59.246 A:middle
phrases that are not intended to

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:00.266 A:middle
be taken literally.

00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:01.806 A:middle
Let's look at a couple of

00:04:01.806 --> 00:04:02.436 A:middle
examples.

00:04:02.556 --> 00:04:04.526 A:middle
I am a native Californian and I

00:04:04.696 --> 00:04:09.016 A:middle
might say oh sick, you crush it

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:12.446 A:middle
or sweet, that rocked.

00:04:13.696 --> 00:04:15.146 A:middle
But here I'm not talking about

00:04:15.146 --> 00:04:16.766 A:middle
illnesses or desserts just

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:17.766 A:middle
saying that someone did

00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:19.356 A:middle
something particularly well.

00:04:20.056 --> 00:04:22.546 A:middle
I may also say it's raining cats

00:04:22.546 --> 00:04:22.976 A:middle
and dogs.

00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:29.696 A:middle
I love the last one.

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:32.166 A:middle
Or I'm hungry enough to eat a

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:32.606 A:middle
horse.

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:34.876 A:middle
This kind of language adds

00:04:34.876 --> 00:04:36.656 A:middle
character to an app, so I'm

00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:38.586 A:middle
certainly not saying never to

00:04:38.586 --> 00:04:39.116 A:middle
use it.

00:04:39.426 --> 00:04:41.226 A:middle
But if you do, do a quick check

00:04:41.226 --> 00:04:42.246 A:middle
to make sure that it's not

00:04:42.246 --> 00:04:43.776 A:middle
offensive and be sure to offer

00:04:43.776 --> 00:04:45.906 A:middle
contextual clues so that even if

00:04:45.906 --> 00:04:47.346 A:middle
a user isn't totally sure what

00:04:47.346 --> 00:04:49.076 A:middle
you mean they can still figure

00:04:50.226 --> 00:04:51.266 A:middle
it out.

00:04:52.196 --> 00:04:54.086 A:middle
Let's talk now about symbology

00:04:55.386 --> 00:04:56.716 A:middle
and do a quick exercise.

00:04:57.676 --> 00:04:59.776 A:middle
Put your hand up and count one,

00:05:00.076 --> 00:05:01.256 A:middle
two, three.

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:06.366 A:middle
Okay now hold that and take a

00:05:06.366 --> 00:05:07.036 A:middle
look around.

00:05:07.636 --> 00:05:08.836 A:middle
How many people have their

00:05:08.886 --> 00:05:11.186 A:middle
thumb, index finger and third

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:12.226 A:middle
finger extended?

00:05:13.326 --> 00:05:15.396 A:middle
How about index, third and ring

00:05:16.336 --> 00:05:17.396 A:middle
or maybe something else

00:05:17.396 --> 00:05:18.196 A:middle
entirely?

00:05:18.836 --> 00:05:21.646 A:middle
This is a great example of the

00:05:21.646 --> 00:05:24.096 A:middle
wide variation in gestures for

00:05:24.096 --> 00:05:25.896 A:middle
something as simple as counting

00:05:25.896 --> 00:05:26.406 A:middle
to three.

00:05:27.746 --> 00:05:28.946 A:middle
If you choose to include

00:05:28.946 --> 00:05:30.786 A:middle
gestures in your app make sure

00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:31.976 A:middle
that it means what you intend

00:05:32.006 --> 00:05:34.726 A:middle
and plan ahead to localize when

00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:35.206 A:middle
appropriate.

00:05:35.426 --> 00:05:39.796 A:middle
Now let's talk about localized

00:05:39.796 --> 00:05:41.566 A:middle
and globalized iconography with

00:05:41.566 --> 00:05:42.926 A:middle
an example from our Maps app.

00:05:43.466 --> 00:05:44.666 A:middle
We're about to look at the set

00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:46.156 A:middle
of icons that we use to

00:05:46.156 --> 00:05:47.576 A:middle
represent an important feature

00:05:47.576 --> 00:05:48.646 A:middle
in different countries.

00:05:49.096 --> 00:05:51.376 A:middle
So, who knows what this

00:05:51.376 --> 00:05:52.056 A:middle
represents?

00:05:54.416 --> 00:05:56.156 A:middle
Okay a couple hands.

00:05:56.916 --> 00:05:58.996 A:middle
How about this?

00:05:58.996 --> 00:06:00.426 A:middle
Getting warmer all right, many

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:01.046 A:middle
more hands.

00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:04.516 A:middle
And about this?

00:06:04.626 --> 00:06:06.306 A:middle
All right, just about everybody.

00:06:08.136 --> 00:06:09.876 A:middle
So, this is the logo of Japan

00:06:09.876 --> 00:06:11.886 A:middle
Post which we use to represent

00:06:11.886 --> 00:06:14.156 A:middle
post offices, but only in Japan.

00:06:15.256 --> 00:06:17.006 A:middle
This is the postal horn which we

00:06:17.006 --> 00:06:18.466 A:middle
use in Sweden, Turkey,

00:06:18.466 --> 00:06:20.196 A:middle
Luxembourg and 28 other

00:06:20.196 --> 00:06:20.826 A:middle
countries.

00:06:21.616 --> 00:06:22.926 A:middle
And finally, in every other

00:06:22.926 --> 00:06:24.956 A:middle
country we use this simple

00:06:24.956 --> 00:06:26.996 A:middle
recognizable letter outline to

00:06:26.996 --> 00:06:29.246 A:middle
symbolize the post office.

00:06:29.246 --> 00:06:30.326 A:middle
I like this example because I

00:06:30.326 --> 00:06:31.426 A:middle
think it represents a nice

00:06:31.526 --> 00:06:33.626 A:middle
spectrum of local to global

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:34.516 A:middle
iconography.

00:06:34.986 --> 00:06:36.176 A:middle
And there's really no right

00:06:36.176 --> 00:06:37.586 A:middle
answer here, but it's an

00:06:37.586 --> 00:06:38.826 A:middle
important question for you to

00:06:38.826 --> 00:06:41.166 A:middle
consider, exactly how specific

00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:42.666 A:middle
do you want to be with your

00:06:42.666 --> 00:06:43.246 A:middle
symbols.

00:06:43.926 --> 00:06:49.386 A:middle
When depicting people keep in

00:06:49.386 --> 00:06:51.066 A:middle
mind that more detailed icons

00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:52.796 A:middle
may exclude some of your users,

00:06:53.636 --> 00:06:54.976 A:middle
but that simpler glyphs like

00:06:55.006 --> 00:06:56.376 A:middle
this silhouette are much more

00:06:56.426 --> 00:06:58.116 A:middle
general and maybe a better

00:06:58.116 --> 00:06:58.396 A:middle
choice.

00:06:58.946 --> 00:07:00.766 A:middle
And as a bonus, we include this

00:07:00.766 --> 00:07:02.656 A:middle
glyph in UIKit so that artwork

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:04.166 A:middle
is already available to you.

00:07:04.846 --> 00:07:07.806 A:middle
Let's talk about our final

00:07:07.806 --> 00:07:10.336 A:middle
consideration now, associations.

00:07:12.086 --> 00:07:13.346 A:middle
What does this owl make you

00:07:13.346 --> 00:07:13.856 A:middle
think of?

00:07:15.636 --> 00:07:16.986 A:middle
If you grew up in an

00:07:16.986 --> 00:07:19.236 A:middle
English-speaking context you may

00:07:19.236 --> 00:07:21.756 A:middle
associate owls with wisdom, but

00:07:21.756 --> 00:07:23.036 A:middle
in much of the Arabic speaking

00:07:23.036 --> 00:07:25.356 A:middle
world owls can be associated

00:07:25.446 --> 00:07:26.916 A:middle
with bad luck or even death.

00:07:27.336 --> 00:07:28.586 A:middle
So, make sure that your

00:07:28.586 --> 00:07:30.016 A:middle
associations are what you

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:30.456 A:middle
expect.

00:07:30.526 --> 00:07:33.556 A:middle
I hope I have helped you to

00:07:33.556 --> 00:07:35.726 A:middle
think further or start thinking

00:07:35.726 --> 00:07:37.076 A:middle
about designing for your global

00:07:37.076 --> 00:07:37.766 A:middle
audience.

00:07:38.156 --> 00:07:39.066 A:middle
Now let's look at some

00:07:39.066 --> 00:07:39.836 A:middle
resources.

00:07:40.896 --> 00:07:42.926 A:middle
First, if you can travel to the

00:07:42.926 --> 00:07:44.546 A:middle
places where your customers live

00:07:44.866 --> 00:07:46.696 A:middle
I hope you will, but not

00:07:46.696 --> 00:07:47.786 A:middle
everyone can travel.

00:07:47.976 --> 00:07:49.476 A:middle
Never fear there are other

00:07:49.476 --> 00:07:51.156 A:middle
resources much closer to home.

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:54.126 A:middle
Could you conduct focus groups

00:07:54.746 --> 00:07:56.506 A:middle
either formal focus groups with

00:07:56.506 --> 00:07:58.456 A:middle
participants selected based on

00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:00.506 A:middle
their primary language, cultural

00:08:00.506 --> 00:08:01.406 A:middle
background or other

00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:04.036 A:middle
characteristics or possibly more

00:08:04.036 --> 00:08:05.936 A:middle
informal focus groups where you

00:08:05.936 --> 00:08:07.336 A:middle
offer snacks to friends or

00:08:07.336 --> 00:08:08.966 A:middle
family in exchange for their

00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:10.256 A:middle
feedback on your designs?

00:08:12.086 --> 00:08:13.156 A:middle
You may be able to draw on

00:08:13.156 --> 00:08:14.386 A:middle
personal or professional

00:08:14.386 --> 00:08:15.486 A:middle
contacts for this kind of

00:08:15.486 --> 00:08:16.426 A:middle
feedback as well.

00:08:17.586 --> 00:08:19.076 A:middle
And now moving to the web,

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.556 A:middle
language learning, translation

00:08:21.556 --> 00:08:23.686 A:middle
and travel funds offer a wealth

00:08:23.746 --> 00:08:25.316 A:middle
of knowledge about language and

00:08:25.316 --> 00:08:27.216 A:middle
symbol use and expectations

00:08:27.216 --> 00:08:28.036 A:middle
around the world.

00:08:28.646 --> 00:08:30.046 A:middle
And web and image searches can

00:08:30.046 --> 00:08:30.886 A:middle
give you a lot of this

00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:31.926 A:middle
information too.

00:08:33.706 --> 00:08:34.826 A:middle
Books and articles can be

00:08:34.826 --> 00:08:36.456 A:middle
helpful as well, look for

00:08:36.456 --> 00:08:38.266 A:middle
keywords like global design,

00:08:38.466 --> 00:08:40.966 A:middle
user experience, intercultural

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:42.946 A:middle
or cross-cultural communication,

00:08:43.276 --> 00:08:45.216 A:middle
visual design and tips for

00:08:45.216 --> 00:08:47.416 A:middle
travelers, businesspeople and

00:08:47.416 --> 00:08:48.306 A:middle
interpreters.

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:51.456 A:middle
Finally, don't forget about

00:08:51.456 --> 00:08:53.116 A:middle
libraries where you can find

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:54.756 A:middle
some of these publications, as

00:08:54.756 --> 00:08:55.986 A:middle
well as map and document

00:08:55.986 --> 00:08:57.216 A:middle
collections with rich

00:08:57.216 --> 00:08:58.076 A:middle
information.

00:08:59.336 --> 00:09:02.906 A:middle
So, to wrap it all up, this is

00:09:02.906 --> 00:09:04.676 A:middle
not an all or nothing design

00:09:04.676 --> 00:09:07.056 A:middle
problem, smart changes can go a

00:09:07.056 --> 00:09:08.626 A:middle
long way toward making your app

00:09:08.836 --> 00:09:10.776 A:middle
more useful for more people.

00:09:11.896 --> 00:09:13.166 A:middle
Use the resources that are

00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:15.126 A:middle
available to you to create a

00:09:15.126 --> 00:09:18.036 A:middle
great user experience and lay

00:09:18.036 --> 00:09:19.506 A:middle
the groundwork for expansion.

00:09:20.656 --> 00:09:21.146 A:middle
You can do this.

00:09:21.146 --> 00:09:21.896 A:middle
Thank you.
