00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:21.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

00:00:22.276 --> 00:00:23.606 A:middle
My name is John Blackwell, and

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:24.676 A:middle
I'm an engineer on the Core

00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:25.426 A:middle
Motion framework.

00:00:25.956 --> 00:00:27.336 A:middle
Today, we're going to be talking

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:28.496 A:middle
about creating immersive

00:00:28.496 --> 00:00:29.776 A:middle
applications with the Core

00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:31.306 A:middle
Motion framework; and we're also

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:32.486 A:middle
going to discuss a number of

00:00:32.486 --> 00:00:33.886 A:middle
best practices along the way.

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.376 A:middle
So today, we're going to be

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:38.386 A:middle
covering a number of things.

00:00:38.896 --> 00:00:40.746 A:middle
The first is a brief overview of

00:00:40.746 --> 00:00:42.116 A:middle
what Core Motion provides.

00:00:42.536 --> 00:00:43.816 A:middle
Next, we're going to talk about

00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:45.816 A:middle
authorization, a frequent pain

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:46.526 A:middle
point for many of our

00:00:46.526 --> 00:00:47.096 A:middle
developers.

00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:48.606 A:middle
Then, we're going to look at

00:00:48.606 --> 00:00:50.116 A:middle
some new additions to Historic

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.336 A:middle
Accelerometer; and then, we're

00:00:52.336 --> 00:00:53.926 A:middle
going to dig into DeviceMotion,

00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.526 A:middle
the sensor fusion that we

00:00:55.526 --> 00:00:56.916 A:middle
provide in Core Motion.

00:00:57.346 --> 00:00:58.526 A:middle
And finally, we're going to look

00:00:58.526 --> 00:01:00.556 A:middle
at Badger with Attitude, a game

00:01:00.556 --> 00:01:01.536 A:middle
where we'll take some of the

00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:03.116 A:middle
concepts that we've talked about

00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:04.796 A:middle
in DeviceMotion and put them

00:01:04.886 --> 00:01:05.556 A:middle
into practice.

00:01:06.686 --> 00:01:08.376 A:middle
And with that, let's take a

00:01:08.376 --> 00:01:09.836 A:middle
closer look at the Core Motion

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:10.356 A:middle
framework.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:15.266 A:middle
The Core Motion framework

00:01:15.476 --> 00:01:16.686 A:middle
provides access to the

00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:18.186 A:middle
accelerometer, the gyroscope,

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:19.556 A:middle
the magnetometer and the

00:01:19.556 --> 00:01:20.896 A:middle
altimeter; and through the

00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:22.476 A:middle
framework, you can access raw

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:23.586 A:middle
forms of the sensor data, as

00:01:23.586 --> 00:01:25.576 A:middle
well as process forms and use

00:01:25.576 --> 00:01:26.886 A:middle
these in your applications.

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:29.546 A:middle
Now, there are a number of

00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:30.996 A:middle
interfaces available through

00:01:30.996 --> 00:01:31.626 A:middle
Core Motion.

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:35.446 A:middle
The first is CMMotionManager,

00:01:35.726 --> 00:01:37.406 A:middle
which provides access to the raw

00:01:37.486 --> 00:01:38.806 A:middle
sensor data, as well as the

00:01:38.806 --> 00:01:40.116 A:middle
sensor fusion in the form of

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:40.916 A:middle
DeviceMotion.

00:01:42.226 --> 00:01:44.156 A:middle
CMAltimeter provides access to

00:01:44.156 --> 00:01:45.606 A:middle
relative altitude updates for

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:45.976 A:middle
the device.

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:49.216 A:middle
CMPedometer provides access to

00:01:49.216 --> 00:01:50.836 A:middle
step counts as step-related

00:01:50.836 --> 00:01:52.156 A:middle
information, as well as

00:01:52.156 --> 00:01:53.616 A:middle
work-out, pause and resume

00:01:53.616 --> 00:01:53.996 A:middle
events.

00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:56.996 A:middle
MotionActivityManager provides

00:01:56.996 --> 00:01:58.696 A:middle
access to the activity context

00:01:58.696 --> 00:02:00.006 A:middle
of the device; for example,

00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:02.106 A:middle
walking, running or automotive,

00:02:02.296 --> 00:02:06.276 A:middle
etc. And CMSensorRecorder

00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:07.976 A:middle
provides access to historic

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:08.826 A:middle
accelerometer data.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:13.576 A:middle
So that's a brief overview of

00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:14.616 A:middle
what the Core Motion framework

00:02:14.616 --> 00:02:15.156 A:middle
provides.

00:02:15.696 --> 00:02:17.166 A:middle
Next, let's take a closer look

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:18.196 A:middle
at authorization.

00:02:19.426 --> 00:02:21.456 A:middle
So of the APIs that I just

00:02:21.456 --> 00:02:23.906 A:middle
mentioned, these following four

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:25.636 A:middle
are sensitive due to the nature

00:02:25.636 --> 00:02:26.846 A:middle
of the private information that

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.106 A:middle
they expose about the user.

00:02:29.376 --> 00:02:31.936 A:middle
So to handle this, we have a

00:02:31.936 --> 00:02:33.426 A:middle
prompt that appears the first

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:34.806 A:middle
time you invoke one of the

00:02:34.806 --> 00:02:35.746 A:middle
sensitive APIs.

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.056 A:middle
Keep in mind that the first time

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:40.966 A:middle
you invoke the sensitive APIs, a

00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:42.336 A:middle
prompt will appear for users;

00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:44.056 A:middle
but after that first time, your

00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:45.106 A:middle
users will need to go into

00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:46.006 A:middle
Settings to change the

00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:47.216 A:middle
authorization state for your

00:02:47.216 --> 00:02:47.986 A:middle
applications.

00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:50.916 A:middle
Now, let's take a look at what

00:02:50.916 --> 00:02:51.996 A:middle
it looks like the first time you

00:02:51.996 --> 00:02:53.036 A:middle
call one of these APIs.

00:02:53.816 --> 00:02:55.406 A:middle
At this point, your users will

00:02:55.406 --> 00:02:56.346 A:middle
need to decide if they want to

00:02:56.346 --> 00:02:57.766 A:middle
grant access to the Motion

00:02:57.766 --> 00:02:59.576 A:middle
Fitness data; or deny access.

00:03:00.016 --> 00:03:01.566 A:middle
And as a developer, you're going

00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:02.676 A:middle
to want to handle the case where

00:03:02.676 --> 00:03:05.166 A:middle
they deny access.

00:03:05.286 --> 00:03:07.376 A:middle
Now, in the past, we've asked

00:03:07.376 --> 00:03:08.406 A:middle
you to do something like this

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:10.596 A:middle
where you call any of our APIs

00:03:10.596 --> 00:03:12.046 A:middle
that are sensitive.

00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:13.826 A:middle
In this case we're calling

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.756 A:middle
queryPedometerData; and then you

00:03:15.756 --> 00:03:17.346 A:middle
ignore the result that you get

00:03:17.346 --> 00:03:19.336 A:middle
back from the API and only look

00:03:19.336 --> 00:03:20.146 A:middle
at the error code.

00:03:21.026 --> 00:03:22.536 A:middle
And if the error code is not

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:24.376 A:middle
authorized, at this point, you

00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:25.536 A:middle
know your application's been

00:03:25.536 --> 00:03:26.886 A:middle
denied access to that motion and

00:03:26.886 --> 00:03:27.476 A:middle
fitness data.

00:03:28.646 --> 00:03:30.126 A:middle
Now, we realize that this is

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:30.846 A:middle
less than ideal.

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:33.196 A:middle
You need to jump through hoops

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:34.816 A:middle
to get access to your

00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:36.386 A:middle
authorization state, and once

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:37.656 A:middle
you get it, you can't tell

00:03:37.656 --> 00:03:39.316 A:middle
exactly why your app has been

00:03:39.316 --> 00:03:40.296 A:middle
denied access.

00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:43.326 A:middle
And that's why this year, we're

00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:44.636 A:middle
providing an Authorization

00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:45.326 A:middle
Status API.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.606 A:middle
This API is available in the

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:48.816 A:middle
same four classes that I

00:03:48.816 --> 00:03:50.086 A:middle
mentioned before, and it's

00:03:50.086 --> 00:03:52.076 A:middle
available on iOS and watchOS.

00:03:52.886 --> 00:03:54.366 A:middle
Let's take a closer look at the

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:56.226 A:middle
CMAuthorizationStatus value that

00:03:56.226 --> 00:03:57.666 A:middle
you'll get back from this API.

00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:01.596 A:middle
The first state, notDetermined,

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.566 A:middle
represents the state before the

00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:04.866 A:middle
user has been asked about

00:04:04.866 --> 00:04:05.856 A:middle
authorization in your

00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:06.466 A:middle
application.

00:04:07.026 --> 00:04:08.806 A:middle
Restricted represents the state

00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:11.386 A:middle
where the user is unable to

00:04:11.386 --> 00:04:12.756 A:middle
change the authorization state

00:04:12.916 --> 00:04:13.826 A:middle
for your application

00:04:13.826 --> 00:04:15.426 A:middle
specifically; and this can

00:04:15.426 --> 00:04:17.086 A:middle
happen when motion and fitness

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.546 A:middle
is disabled in privacy.

00:04:19.406 --> 00:04:20.496 A:middle
The next state -- denied --

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:21.596 A:middle
means what it sounds like.

00:04:21.776 --> 00:04:22.526 A:middle
Your application's been

00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:24.256 A:middle
specifically denied access by

00:04:24.256 --> 00:04:24.746 A:middle
the users.

00:04:25.156 --> 00:04:26.906 A:middle
And authorized means your app is

00:04:26.906 --> 00:04:28.026 A:middle
ready to access the user's

00:04:28.026 --> 00:04:29.006 A:middle
motion and fitness data.

00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:32.746 A:middle
Now, let's come back to the

00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:33.836 A:middle
authorization check that we were

00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:34.606 A:middle
looking at before.

00:04:34.856 --> 00:04:37.176 A:middle
One of the first best practices

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:38.796 A:middle
that I want to talk about is

00:04:39.126 --> 00:04:40.266 A:middle
making sure that you check for

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:42.006 A:middle
the availability of a given API

00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:44.006 A:middle
first before you ask for the

00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:44.946 A:middle
authorization status.

00:04:45.656 --> 00:04:47.036 A:middle
In this case, we're asking for a

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:47.896 A:middle
StepCountingAvailable.

00:04:48.816 --> 00:04:50.136 A:middle
And the next thing that you're

00:04:50.136 --> 00:04:51.476 A:middle
going to want to do is query for

00:04:51.476 --> 00:04:52.496 A:middle
the authorization status.

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:54.446 A:middle
And at this point, it's up to

00:04:54.446 --> 00:04:56.436 A:middle
you as a developer to decide how

00:04:56.506 --> 00:04:57.566 A:middle
you want to handle the

00:04:57.566 --> 00:04:59.196 A:middle
authorization that you get back

00:04:59.396 --> 00:05:00.176 A:middle
from the framework.

00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:01.966 A:middle
You now have a simple mechanism

00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:04.256 A:middle
for doing this on both iOS and

00:05:04.366 --> 00:05:04.876 A:middle
watchOS.

00:05:06.336 --> 00:05:08.896 A:middle
I encourage you to consider how

00:05:08.896 --> 00:05:09.956 A:middle
you can use the authorization

00:05:09.956 --> 00:05:11.776 A:middle
status app -- authorization

00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:13.266 A:middle
status API in your applications

00:05:13.486 --> 00:05:14.586 A:middle
-- and you should definitely use

00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:14.716 A:middle
it.

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:16.836 A:middle
Next, we're going to talk about

00:05:16.836 --> 00:05:18.066 A:middle
Historical Accelerometer.

00:05:19.056 --> 00:05:20.756 A:middle
Historical Accelerometer, also

00:05:20.756 --> 00:05:22.196 A:middle
known as CMSensorRecorder,

00:05:22.536 --> 00:05:24.336 A:middle
provide 50 hertz accelerometer

00:05:24.336 --> 00:05:25.926 A:middle
data; and we can record this for

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.256 A:middle
your applications while your

00:05:27.256 --> 00:05:28.356 A:middle
apps are in the background.

00:05:29.556 --> 00:05:31.426 A:middle
You can request up to 36 hours

00:05:31.426 --> 00:05:33.406 A:middle
of accelerometer data, and this

00:05:33.406 --> 00:05:34.716 A:middle
data will be stored on your

00:05:34.716 --> 00:05:36.386 A:middle
behalf for up to three days.

00:05:37.786 --> 00:05:39.696 A:middle
Now, Historical Accelerometer is

00:05:39.696 --> 00:05:41.176 A:middle
currently available on Apple

00:05:41.176 --> 00:05:43.476 A:middle
Watch, and today, I'm excited to

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:45.126 A:middle
announce that it's now available

00:05:45.126 --> 00:05:46.826 A:middle
on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.

00:05:47.886 --> 00:05:49.406 A:middle
This opens up a whole new set of

00:05:49.406 --> 00:05:50.996 A:middle
use cases for your applications,

00:05:51.216 --> 00:05:52.206 A:middle
and to get you thinking about

00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:53.626 A:middle
how you can use Historical

00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:55.376 A:middle
Accelerometer on iPhone, let's

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:56.316 A:middle
walk through one sample

00:05:56.316 --> 00:05:58.646 A:middle
application now.

00:05:59.056 --> 00:06:00.496 A:middle
So let's say you're a big

00:06:00.496 --> 00:06:02.366 A:middle
automotive enthusiast, and you

00:06:02.366 --> 00:06:03.726 A:middle
want to build an application to

00:06:03.726 --> 00:06:05.096 A:middle
enable you to track your car's

00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:06.736 A:middle
performance over a long-track

00:06:06.736 --> 00:06:06.926 A:middle
day.

00:06:07.736 --> 00:06:09.086 A:middle
How would we go about building

00:06:09.086 --> 00:06:09.306 A:middle
this?

00:06:09.746 --> 00:06:10.986 A:middle
Well, the first thing that we

00:06:10.986 --> 00:06:12.256 A:middle
want to figure out is when the

00:06:12.256 --> 00:06:14.526 A:middle
user is driving, and for that,

00:06:14.526 --> 00:06:15.726 A:middle
we can use Motion Activity.

00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:17.476 A:middle
Motion Activity provides an

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:19.436 A:middle
automotive state, and we can use

00:06:19.436 --> 00:06:20.566 A:middle
this to determine the periods in

00:06:20.566 --> 00:06:21.576 A:middle
which the user is driving.

00:06:22.996 --> 00:06:24.316 A:middle
Now, I want to take a brief

00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:25.636 A:middle
minute to talk about the

00:06:25.636 --> 00:06:26.706 A:middle
automotive detection.

00:06:27.336 --> 00:06:29.566 A:middle
In iOS 11, the automotive

00:06:29.566 --> 00:06:31.036 A:middle
detection has received special

00:06:31.036 --> 00:06:32.156 A:middle
attention to ensure

00:06:32.156 --> 00:06:33.626 A:middle
best-in-class performance.

00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:35.956 A:middle
This automotive state in Motion

00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:37.746 A:middle
Activity is the same state

00:06:37.746 --> 00:06:39.016 A:middle
that's being used to power Do

00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:40.386 A:middle
Not Disturb While Driving; and

00:06:40.386 --> 00:06:41.826 A:middle
it's also available for you to

00:06:41.826 --> 00:06:43.186 A:middle
use in your applications.

00:06:43.456 --> 00:06:44.496 A:middle
If, say, you wanted to

00:06:44.496 --> 00:06:46.066 A:middle
personalize your application's

00:06:46.066 --> 00:06:47.406 A:middle
UI while the user is driving.

00:06:48.426 --> 00:06:49.766 A:middle
Now, coming back to our

00:06:49.766 --> 00:06:51.156 A:middle
automotive performance tracking

00:06:51.156 --> 00:06:52.666 A:middle
application, the next thing we

00:06:52.666 --> 00:06:54.526 A:middle
want to do, is we want to gather

00:06:54.766 --> 00:06:55.776 A:middle
the accelerometer data.

00:06:56.256 --> 00:06:57.876 A:middle
And for that, we can use

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:58.546 A:middle
SensorRecorder.

00:06:58.846 --> 00:07:00.566 A:middle
We can gather the accelerometer

00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:02.056 A:middle
data for the periods in which

00:07:02.106 --> 00:07:03.336 A:middle
the user is driving, and

00:07:03.336 --> 00:07:05.276 A:middle
translate that into metrics for

00:07:05.276 --> 00:07:07.066 A:middle
the user, such as how many Gs

00:07:07.066 --> 00:07:07.946 A:middle
they were pulling through a

00:07:07.946 --> 00:07:10.376 A:middle
turn, or maximum lateral Gs or

00:07:10.376 --> 00:07:11.366 A:middle
longitudinal Gs.

00:07:12.006 --> 00:07:14.236 A:middle
Now, there are many different

00:07:14.236 --> 00:07:16.036 A:middle
ways you could consider building

00:07:16.256 --> 00:07:17.956 A:middle
this kind of application, but by

00:07:18.066 --> 00:07:19.816 A:middle
using the Motion APIs, you can

00:07:19.816 --> 00:07:20.786 A:middle
provide your users with a

00:07:20.786 --> 00:07:22.796 A:middle
low-power, all-day experience.

00:07:23.516 --> 00:07:26.206 A:middle
Now, there are a number of best

00:07:26.206 --> 00:07:28.036 A:middle
practices to keep in mind with

00:07:28.036 --> 00:07:29.196 A:middle
Historical Accelerometer.

00:07:29.766 --> 00:07:31.216 A:middle
The first is that you want to

00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:32.926 A:middle
choose the minimum duration that

00:07:32.926 --> 00:07:34.096 A:middle
makes sense for your

00:07:34.096 --> 00:07:34.836 A:middle
applications.

00:07:35.536 --> 00:07:37.046 A:middle
So for automotive performance

00:07:37.046 --> 00:07:38.786 A:middle
tracking application, we may not

00:07:38.786 --> 00:07:41.116 A:middle
need the full 36 hours of data

00:07:41.986 --> 00:07:43.546 A:middle
-- something more like 8 to 12

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:44.706 A:middle
hours would make more sense.

00:07:45.896 --> 00:07:47.326 A:middle
And the next best practice to

00:07:47.326 --> 00:07:48.516 A:middle
keep in mind is to consider

00:07:48.516 --> 00:07:50.506 A:middle
decimating or dropping samples

00:07:50.506 --> 00:07:52.386 A:middle
if you don't need the full 50

00:07:52.386 --> 00:07:53.626 A:middle
hertz accelerometer data.

00:07:54.326 --> 00:07:56.176 A:middle
These two suggestions, these two

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:58.206 A:middle
best practices, will reduce the

00:07:58.206 --> 00:07:59.316 A:middle
amount of processing that your

00:07:59.316 --> 00:08:00.906 A:middle
application is doing, and in

00:08:00.906 --> 00:08:02.256 A:middle
turn, save the user's battery

00:08:02.256 --> 00:08:02.666 A:middle
life.

00:08:03.656 --> 00:08:05.836 A:middle
Now, I encourage you to consider

00:08:06.086 --> 00:08:07.736 A:middle
how you can use Historical

00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:09.546 A:middle
Accelerometer on iPhone.

00:08:10.046 --> 00:08:13.636 A:middle
Next, let's talk about

00:08:13.636 --> 00:08:14.566 A:middle
DeviceMotion.

00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:16.686 A:middle
DeviceMotion is the name for the

00:08:16.766 --> 00:08:18.536 A:middle
sensor fusion algorithm that we

00:08:18.536 --> 00:08:19.826 A:middle
provide in the Core Motion

00:08:19.826 --> 00:08:20.306 A:middle
framework.

00:08:21.146 --> 00:08:23.106 A:middle
Now, there are a number of

00:08:23.106 --> 00:08:23.846 A:middle
things that go into

00:08:23.846 --> 00:08:24.686 A:middle
DeviceMotion.

00:08:25.966 --> 00:08:27.396 A:middle
The first sensor that we use in

00:08:27.396 --> 00:08:28.176 A:middle
DeviceMotion is the

00:08:28.176 --> 00:08:29.446 A:middle
accelerometer, and the

00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:30.806 A:middle
accelerometer enables us to

00:08:30.806 --> 00:08:31.776 A:middle
measure the accelerations

00:08:31.776 --> 00:08:33.336 A:middle
imparted by the user, as well as

00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:34.536 A:middle
the acceleration imparted by

00:08:34.536 --> 00:08:35.026 A:middle
gravity.

00:08:36.176 --> 00:08:37.466 A:middle
The gyroscope enables us to

00:08:37.466 --> 00:08:38.886 A:middle
precisely measure the rotation

00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:39.716 A:middle
rate of the device.

00:08:40.236 --> 00:08:41.946 A:middle
And the magnetometer allows us

00:08:41.946 --> 00:08:43.566 A:middle
to measure local fields around

00:08:43.566 --> 00:08:44.876 A:middle
the device as well as the

00:08:44.876 --> 00:08:45.906 A:middle
Earth's magnetic field.

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:48.886 A:middle
Now, when dealing with the raw

00:08:48.886 --> 00:08:49.866 A:middle
sensors, there's a number of

00:08:49.866 --> 00:08:51.096 A:middle
challenges to keep in mind.

00:08:51.956 --> 00:08:53.176 A:middle
With the accelerometer, it can

00:08:53.176 --> 00:08:54.916 A:middle
be difficult to distinguish from

00:08:54.916 --> 00:08:55.996 A:middle
the accelerations imparted by

00:08:55.996 --> 00:08:57.826 A:middle
the user; and from those

00:08:58.386 --> 00:09:00.166 A:middle
imparted by the force of

00:09:01.836 --> 00:09:02.276 A:middle
gravity.

00:09:02.376 --> 00:09:03.566 A:middle
With the gyroscope, we can have

00:09:03.566 --> 00:09:04.706 A:middle
bias in the measurements over

00:09:04.706 --> 00:09:06.986 A:middle
time, and with the magnetometer,

00:09:06.986 --> 00:09:07.756 A:middle
it can be difficult to

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:09.256 A:middle
distinguish between the local

00:09:09.256 --> 00:09:10.586 A:middle
fields and the Earth's magnetic

00:09:10.586 --> 00:09:10.936 A:middle
field.

00:09:11.326 --> 00:09:13.346 A:middle
And this is where DeviceMotion

00:09:13.346 --> 00:09:13.876 A:middle
comes in.

00:09:14.566 --> 00:09:16.306 A:middle
DeviceMotion provides 3D

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:17.716 A:middle
attitude tracking while the

00:09:17.716 --> 00:09:19.236 A:middle
device is undergoing free-space

00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:19.846 A:middle
motion.

00:09:20.636 --> 00:09:22.156 A:middle
And it does this by fusing

00:09:22.156 --> 00:09:23.826 A:middle
together all of the sensors to

00:09:23.826 --> 00:09:25.546 A:middle
relay the advantages of each,

00:09:25.676 --> 00:09:26.476 A:middle
while minimizing the

00:09:26.476 --> 00:09:27.286 A:middle
disadvantages.

00:09:28.246 --> 00:09:30.026 A:middle
And as a developer, what this

00:09:30.026 --> 00:09:31.856 A:middle
really means is it enables you

00:09:32.126 --> 00:09:34.066 A:middle
to focus on how you want to use

00:09:34.066 --> 00:09:35.466 A:middle
the motion data rather than the

00:09:35.466 --> 00:09:36.766 A:middle
mechanics of trying to get the

00:09:36.766 --> 00:09:38.036 A:middle
best from the sensors.

00:09:39.776 --> 00:09:41.016 A:middle
Now, we've talked about

00:09:41.016 --> 00:09:42.496 A:middle
DeviceMotion in a number of

00:09:42.496 --> 00:09:43.376 A:middle
previous sessions.

00:09:43.626 --> 00:09:44.796 A:middle
I encourage you to check them

00:09:44.796 --> 00:09:45.116 A:middle
out.

00:09:45.436 --> 00:09:46.606 A:middle
We go into details about the

00:09:46.636 --> 00:09:48.116 A:middle
sensors and the DeviceMotion

00:09:48.116 --> 00:09:48.756 A:middle
algorithms.

00:09:49.216 --> 00:09:51.036 A:middle
But today, we're going to think

00:09:51.036 --> 00:09:52.886 A:middle
about how we can use certain

00:09:52.886 --> 00:09:54.426 A:middle
aspects of DeviceMotion to

00:09:54.426 --> 00:09:55.696 A:middle
create immersive applications

00:09:55.696 --> 00:09:56.386 A:middle
for your users.

00:09:56.386 --> 00:10:00.666 A:middle
So as a developer, when you're

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:01.616 A:middle
first getting started with

00:10:01.616 --> 00:10:03.136 A:middle
DeviceMotion, the first thing

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:04.256 A:middle
that you need to consider are

00:10:04.256 --> 00:10:05.186 A:middle
the reference frames.

00:10:05.416 --> 00:10:07.076 A:middle
The reference frames determine

00:10:07.396 --> 00:10:08.906 A:middle
which sensors are used in the

00:10:08.906 --> 00:10:11.006 A:middle
fusion, and how attitude is

00:10:11.006 --> 00:10:11.886 A:middle
calculated for your

00:10:11.886 --> 00:10:12.656 A:middle
applications.

00:10:13.616 --> 00:10:14.786 A:middle
The first reference frame,

00:10:14.956 --> 00:10:17.046 A:middle
xArbitraryZVertical, fuses

00:10:17.046 --> 00:10:18.166 A:middle
together the accelerometer and

00:10:18.166 --> 00:10:19.406 A:middle
the gyroscope but does not use

00:10:19.406 --> 00:10:19.976 A:middle
the magnetometer.

00:10:20.716 --> 00:10:21.886 A:middle
And the last three reference

00:10:21.886 --> 00:10:23.536 A:middle
frames, xArbitraryCorrected,

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:25.076 A:middle
xMagneticNorth, and

00:10:25.076 --> 00:10:26.936 A:middle
xTrueNorthZVertical, use all

00:10:26.936 --> 00:10:27.626 A:middle
three sensors.

00:10:28.776 --> 00:10:30.216 A:middle
Now, let's talk about the first

00:10:30.216 --> 00:10:31.846 A:middle
reference frame in more detail.

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:34.786 A:middle
Let's say you've got an awesome

00:10:34.786 --> 00:10:35.876 A:middle
racing game where you're

00:10:35.876 --> 00:10:37.376 A:middle
currently using touch controls

00:10:37.596 --> 00:10:39.176 A:middle
to allow your users to steer in

00:10:39.176 --> 00:10:39.646 A:middle
the game.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:41.556 A:middle
This is great, but we could

00:10:41.556 --> 00:10:42.716 A:middle
provide a more immersive

00:10:42.716 --> 00:10:44.526 A:middle
experience using motion.

00:10:45.926 --> 00:10:47.956 A:middle
What we want to do is we want to

00:10:47.956 --> 00:10:50.146 A:middle
enable users to steer using

00:10:50.146 --> 00:10:51.526 A:middle
their device; so when they tilt

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:52.836 A:middle
their car -- tilt their device

00:10:52.836 --> 00:10:54.276 A:middle
to the left, the car will turn

00:10:55.836 --> 00:10:55.996 A:middle
left.

00:10:56.206 --> 00:10:57.496 A:middle
Now, as long as the device is

00:10:57.496 --> 00:10:59.466 A:middle
relatively static, we can use

00:10:59.466 --> 00:11:01.226 A:middle
the accelerometer to estimate

00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:03.556 A:middle
the force of gravity; and once

00:11:03.556 --> 00:11:05.186 A:middle
we have gravity, we can use that

00:11:05.186 --> 00:11:06.466 A:middle
to determine the tilt, or the

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:07.966 A:middle
angle offset from gravity.

00:11:08.616 --> 00:11:11.656 A:middle
One thing to keep in mind,

00:11:11.656 --> 00:11:13.126 A:middle
though, is that if you were

00:11:13.126 --> 00:11:14.776 A:middle
using the accelerometer on its

00:11:14.776 --> 00:11:17.126 A:middle
own, certain gestures can be

00:11:17.126 --> 00:11:17.786 A:middle
ambiguous.

00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:20.476 A:middle
Tilting the device to the right

00:11:20.856 --> 00:11:21.896 A:middle
can look the same to the

00:11:21.896 --> 00:11:23.506 A:middle
accelerometer as sliding the

00:11:23.506 --> 00:11:24.536 A:middle
device to the left.

00:11:25.306 --> 00:11:26.636 A:middle
Now, one way you could consider

00:11:26.636 --> 00:11:28.106 A:middle
dealing with this is by

00:11:28.106 --> 00:11:29.846 A:middle
averaging over the accelerometer

00:11:29.916 --> 00:11:30.236 A:middle
signal.

00:11:31.276 --> 00:11:32.886 A:middle
In doing so, you would reduce

00:11:32.936 --> 00:11:34.446 A:middle
the short-term effects from the

00:11:34.446 --> 00:11:35.916 A:middle
user and leave only the

00:11:35.916 --> 00:11:37.506 A:middle
long-term effects, such as the

00:11:37.506 --> 00:11:38.226 A:middle
force of gravity.

00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:40.786 A:middle
However, in doing this, you

00:11:40.786 --> 00:11:41.836 A:middle
would notice your application

00:11:41.836 --> 00:11:43.196 A:middle
would now respond more slowly.

00:11:43.336 --> 00:11:45.396 A:middle
And this is where DeviceMotion

00:11:45.396 --> 00:11:45.916 A:middle
comes in.

00:11:46.736 --> 00:11:48.516 A:middle
DeviceMotion means that your

00:11:48.516 --> 00:11:49.816 A:middle
application doesn't need to

00:11:49.816 --> 00:11:51.316 A:middle
build up filtering logic to get

00:11:51.316 --> 00:11:53.036 A:middle
great performance from sensors.

00:11:55.276 --> 00:11:57.846 A:middle
With the xArbitraryZVertical

00:11:57.846 --> 00:11:59.706 A:middle
reference frame, this is the

00:11:59.706 --> 00:12:00.786 A:middle
default reference frame that

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:02.276 A:middle
your application will receive if

00:12:02.276 --> 00:12:03.886 A:middle
you don't explicitly specify one

00:12:04.116 --> 00:12:05.616 A:middle
when you start DeviceMotion

00:12:05.616 --> 00:12:06.106 A:middle
updates.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:08.136 A:middle
And this reference frame is

00:12:08.136 --> 00:12:09.646 A:middle
great for use cases where you

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:10.936 A:middle
want to track the tip and the

00:12:10.936 --> 00:12:13.706 A:middle
tilt of the device.

00:12:13.706 --> 00:12:15.516 A:middle
And for our use case in the

00:12:15.516 --> 00:12:17.306 A:middle
game, the accelerometer and the

00:12:17.306 --> 00:12:18.596 A:middle
gyroscope are going to fuse

00:12:18.596 --> 00:12:19.976 A:middle
together to allow us to more

00:12:19.976 --> 00:12:21.486 A:middle
quickly and precisely track

00:12:21.486 --> 00:12:21.936 A:middle
gravity.

00:12:22.526 --> 00:12:24.256 A:middle
And once we have gravity, we can

00:12:24.256 --> 00:12:25.726 A:middle
translate that into tilt for our

00:12:25.726 --> 00:12:26.076 A:middle
game.

00:12:27.326 --> 00:12:28.926 A:middle
Now, to walk through exactly how

00:12:28.926 --> 00:12:30.596 A:middle
to do this, my co-worker Ahmad

00:12:30.596 --> 00:12:31.456 A:middle
is going to come to the stage a

00:12:31.456 --> 00:12:33.386 A:middle
bit later and show us.

00:12:33.936 --> 00:12:36.146 A:middle
This reference frame is also

00:12:36.146 --> 00:12:37.816 A:middle
great for use cases where you

00:12:37.816 --> 00:12:39.576 A:middle
want to track gestures from the

00:12:39.576 --> 00:12:39.976 A:middle
user.

00:12:40.546 --> 00:12:41.926 A:middle
I encourage you to check out our

00:12:41.926 --> 00:12:43.646 A:middle
sample application, SwingWatch.

00:12:44.356 --> 00:12:46.166 A:middle
SwingWatch is an app that runs

00:12:46.436 --> 00:12:47.906 A:middle
on the watch that uses

00:12:48.066 --> 00:12:49.696 A:middle
DeviceMotion to track when

00:12:49.696 --> 00:12:51.416 A:middle
you've made a forehand or a

00:12:51.416 --> 00:12:53.116 A:middle
backhand gesture during a tennis

00:12:53.156 --> 00:12:53.486 A:middle
game.

00:12:54.236 --> 00:12:55.336 A:middle
Both the sample code and the

00:12:55.336 --> 00:12:56.336 A:middle
session are online, and I

00:12:56.336 --> 00:12:58.146 A:middle
encourage you to check them out.

00:12:58.956 --> 00:13:00.936 A:middle
So, let's say you've got another

00:13:00.936 --> 00:13:01.346 A:middle
game.

00:13:02.096 --> 00:13:03.386 A:middle
Let's say it's a shooter game

00:13:03.586 --> 00:13:05.666 A:middle
where you allow the user to aim

00:13:05.736 --> 00:13:07.066 A:middle
using virtual thumb-sticks.

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:09.496 A:middle
This is great, but we could

00:13:09.496 --> 00:13:10.446 A:middle
provide a more immersive

00:13:10.446 --> 00:13:12.156 A:middle
experience using motion.

00:13:15.936 --> 00:13:17.976 A:middle
And what we want to do is we

00:13:17.976 --> 00:13:19.776 A:middle
want to determine where the user

00:13:19.776 --> 00:13:21.386 A:middle
is pointing their device and

00:13:21.386 --> 00:13:23.566 A:middle
have that translate into aiming

00:13:23.656 --> 00:13:25.306 A:middle
in the game; and for that, we

00:13:25.306 --> 00:13:26.346 A:middle
want to use attitude.

00:13:27.686 --> 00:13:29.496 A:middle
Attitude provides the rotation

00:13:29.496 --> 00:13:31.306 A:middle
from the reference frame, fixed

00:13:31.306 --> 00:13:32.186 A:middle
when you first start

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:34.086 A:middle
DeviceMotion updates, to where

00:13:34.086 --> 00:13:35.406 A:middle
the user is currently holding

00:13:35.406 --> 00:13:38.346 A:middle
the device in 3D space.

00:13:38.556 --> 00:13:39.946 A:middle
Now, one way you could consider

00:13:39.946 --> 00:13:41.966 A:middle
getting attitude is by taking

00:13:41.966 --> 00:13:43.826 A:middle
the integral of a raw gyroscope

00:13:43.826 --> 00:13:44.226 A:middle
signal.

00:13:44.846 --> 00:13:47.256 A:middle
Your sway would determine the

00:13:47.256 --> 00:13:47.746 A:middle
attitude.

00:13:48.236 --> 00:13:50.106 A:middle
However, this method for

00:13:50.106 --> 00:13:51.966 A:middle
determining attitude would drift

00:13:51.966 --> 00:13:53.926 A:middle
over time due to bias in the

00:13:53.926 --> 00:13:56.936 A:middle
gyroscope, and that's where the

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:58.616 A:middle
xArbitraryCorrectedZVertical

00:13:58.616 --> 00:13:59.606 A:middle
reference frame comes in.

00:14:00.196 --> 00:14:01.376 A:middle
This reference frame uses the

00:14:01.376 --> 00:14:03.076 A:middle
magnetometer to improve the

00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:04.686 A:middle
horizontal attitude estimation

00:14:04.956 --> 00:14:07.236 A:middle
that we provide; and as a

00:14:07.236 --> 00:14:08.626 A:middle
developer, what this reference

00:14:08.626 --> 00:14:09.886 A:middle
frame means to you is it

00:14:09.886 --> 00:14:11.546 A:middle
provides reliable attitude

00:14:11.546 --> 00:14:13.386 A:middle
performance with a fixed center

00:14:13.386 --> 00:14:13.916 A:middle
reference.

00:14:14.286 --> 00:14:16.206 A:middle
So in the game, your users can

00:14:16.206 --> 00:14:17.706 A:middle
move the device around and then

00:14:17.746 --> 00:14:19.046 A:middle
come back to a known center

00:14:19.046 --> 00:14:19.666 A:middle
location.

00:14:21.166 --> 00:14:22.546 A:middle
Now, there are many other ways

00:14:22.546 --> 00:14:23.756 A:middle
you could consider using this

00:14:23.756 --> 00:14:24.426 A:middle
reference frame.

00:14:25.046 --> 00:14:26.176 A:middle
Let's say you wanted to build a

00:14:26.176 --> 00:14:28.356 A:middle
360-degree photo and video

00:14:28.356 --> 00:14:29.236 A:middle
player application.

00:14:29.236 --> 00:14:30.906 A:middle
Your users would be able to move

00:14:30.906 --> 00:14:32.356 A:middle
their device around and then

00:14:32.356 --> 00:14:33.966 A:middle
bring it back towards the center

00:14:34.126 --> 00:14:35.276 A:middle
-- towards the dock overlooking

00:14:35.276 --> 00:14:35.646 A:middle
the lake.

00:14:37.286 --> 00:14:38.296 A:middle
Now, another way you could

00:14:38.296 --> 00:14:39.736 A:middle
consider using this reference

00:14:39.736 --> 00:14:41.366 A:middle
frame is for something like a

00:14:41.366 --> 00:14:42.766 A:middle
virtual-reality real estate

00:14:42.766 --> 00:14:44.646 A:middle
application where you want to

00:14:44.646 --> 00:14:46.636 A:middle
allow your users to look around

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:47.656 A:middle
at different parts of a room

00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:48.866 A:middle
just by moving their device.

00:14:50.486 --> 00:14:51.596 A:middle
Now, let's say you build this

00:14:51.596 --> 00:14:53.046 A:middle
application out, and your users

00:14:53.116 --> 00:14:55.066 A:middle
love it; but they want to get a

00:14:55.066 --> 00:14:56.356 A:middle
better sense of in which

00:14:56.356 --> 00:14:58.646 A:middle
direction the windows face, or

00:14:58.746 --> 00:14:59.736 A:middle
in which direction they can

00:14:59.736 --> 00:15:00.766 A:middle
expect the sun to rise.

00:15:01.096 --> 00:15:03.226 A:middle
And for that, we want a world

00:15:03.226 --> 00:15:03.676 A:middle
reference.

00:15:05.366 --> 00:15:07.076 A:middle
Now, you could consider using

00:15:07.076 --> 00:15:08.136 A:middle
the magnetometer for this.

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:09.466 A:middle
This would provide a world

00:15:09.466 --> 00:15:10.556 A:middle
reference and enable your

00:15:10.556 --> 00:15:11.906 A:middle
applications to orient with

00:15:11.906 --> 00:15:12.806 A:middle
respect to the world.

00:15:13.646 --> 00:15:14.966 A:middle
However, using the raw

00:15:14.966 --> 00:15:16.846 A:middle
magnetometer, you would find the

00:15:16.846 --> 00:15:17.946 A:middle
output susceptible to

00:15:17.946 --> 00:15:18.626 A:middle
disturbances.

00:15:19.556 --> 00:15:21.406 A:middle
Some of these are inherent to

00:15:21.406 --> 00:15:23.306 A:middle
the device, and some of these

00:15:23.306 --> 00:15:24.346 A:middle
are external to the device.

00:15:25.706 --> 00:15:26.936 A:middle
This is where the final two

00:15:26.936 --> 00:15:28.026 A:middle
reference frames come in.

00:15:28.566 --> 00:15:30.706 A:middle
These reference frames use the

00:15:30.706 --> 00:15:32.586 A:middle
magnetometer to orient the

00:15:32.586 --> 00:15:34.616 A:middle
device with respect to the

00:15:34.736 --> 00:15:36.956 A:middle
world, and these reference

00:15:36.956 --> 00:15:38.606 A:middle
frames handle magnetic

00:15:38.746 --> 00:15:40.966 A:middle
device-level effects; as well as

00:15:40.966 --> 00:15:42.396 A:middle
in challenging magnetometer

00:15:42.396 --> 00:15:44.266 A:middle
situations, we can stabilize the

00:15:44.266 --> 00:15:44.696 A:middle
output.

00:15:46.176 --> 00:15:48.046 A:middle
Now, choosing between these two

00:15:48.046 --> 00:15:49.656 A:middle
reference frames is going to be

00:15:49.656 --> 00:15:50.576 A:middle
based on the needs of your

00:15:50.576 --> 00:15:51.206 A:middle
application.

00:15:51.646 --> 00:15:52.886 A:middle
If you've already got data

00:15:53.076 --> 00:15:54.276 A:middle
that's referencing true north --

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:55.796 A:middle
for example, map data -- it

00:15:55.796 --> 00:15:57.166 A:middle
would make sense to use the

00:15:57.166 --> 00:15:58.786 A:middle
xTrueNorthZVertical reference

00:15:58.786 --> 00:15:59.106 A:middle
frame.

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:03.356 A:middle
Now, how could we consider using

00:16:03.356 --> 00:16:04.326 A:middle
these reference frames?

00:16:04.916 --> 00:16:07.106 A:middle
Well, one example is things like

00:16:07.106 --> 00:16:08.816 A:middle
stargazing applications, where

00:16:08.816 --> 00:16:09.846 A:middle
you want to allow your users to

00:16:09.846 --> 00:16:11.506 A:middle
point their device at a star in

00:16:11.506 --> 00:16:14.056 A:middle
the sky and identify it.

00:16:14.316 --> 00:16:14.896 A:middle
Another way you could

00:16:14.896 --> 00:16:15.636 A:middle
considering using these

00:16:15.636 --> 00:16:17.106 A:middle
reference frames are for things

00:16:17.106 --> 00:16:18.076 A:middle
like augmented reality

00:16:18.076 --> 00:16:19.756 A:middle
applications where you want to

00:16:19.756 --> 00:16:21.736 A:middle
fuse the camera data with a

00:16:21.736 --> 00:16:22.546 A:middle
world reference.

00:16:22.906 --> 00:16:24.196 A:middle
And for that, we encourage you

00:16:24.196 --> 00:16:25.106 A:middle
to check out ARKit.

00:16:25.496 --> 00:16:26.746 A:middle
ARKit's session follows

00:16:26.746 --> 00:16:27.876 A:middle
immediately after this one.

00:16:27.876 --> 00:16:32.196 A:middle
Now, let's come back to our

00:16:32.196 --> 00:16:33.516 A:middle
virtual-reality real estate

00:16:33.516 --> 00:16:34.116 A:middle
application.

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:35.886 A:middle
Let's say you built the

00:16:35.886 --> 00:16:37.276 A:middle
application out, and your users

00:16:37.276 --> 00:16:39.306 A:middle
love it, but you want to provide

00:16:39.306 --> 00:16:40.696 A:middle
them with more features.

00:16:41.186 --> 00:16:42.416 A:middle
Let's say you want to put

00:16:42.416 --> 00:16:44.166 A:middle
landmarks on the horizon in the

00:16:44.166 --> 00:16:45.296 A:middle
direction that they actually

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:45.576 A:middle
are.

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.166 A:middle
How would we go about doing

00:16:48.166 --> 00:16:48.346 A:middle
this?

00:16:49.096 --> 00:16:51.006 A:middle
Well, what we want is heading.

00:16:52.376 --> 00:16:54.266 A:middle
Heading gives us the direction

00:16:54.266 --> 00:16:55.376 A:middle
the device is pointing with

00:16:55.376 --> 00:16:56.346 A:middle
respect to north.

00:16:56.786 --> 00:16:58.226 A:middle
So when the device is pointing

00:16:58.306 --> 00:17:00.086 A:middle
straight towards north, heading

00:17:00.086 --> 00:17:03.076 A:middle
would return 0 degrees and as

00:17:03.076 --> 00:17:04.486 A:middle
the user rotates their device

00:17:04.546 --> 00:17:06.206 A:middle
around, the heading angle would

00:17:06.206 --> 00:17:06.586 A:middle
update.

00:17:08.106 --> 00:17:09.556 A:middle
Now, one way you could consider

00:17:09.556 --> 00:17:11.086 A:middle
getting heading is by using

00:17:11.086 --> 00:17:11.846 A:middle
CoreLocation.

00:17:12.316 --> 00:17:14.306 A:middle
CoreLocation provides a start

00:17:14.306 --> 00:17:17.006 A:middle
updating heading API that you

00:17:17.006 --> 00:17:18.796 A:middle
could then use the heading from

00:17:18.796 --> 00:17:20.446 A:middle
and fuse that in with the data

00:17:20.446 --> 00:17:21.476 A:middle
that you're already getting from

00:17:21.476 --> 00:17:22.236 A:middle
DeviceMotion.

00:17:24.366 --> 00:17:25.256 A:middle
One thing to keep in mind,

00:17:25.256 --> 00:17:26.966 A:middle
though, is that CoreLocation's

00:17:26.966 --> 00:17:28.926 A:middle
heading can fuse course.

00:17:29.846 --> 00:17:31.216 A:middle
Course is the direction of

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:32.066 A:middle
travel for the device.

00:17:32.896 --> 00:17:34.646 A:middle
Now, this may make sense for

00:17:34.646 --> 00:17:35.746 A:middle
things like turn-by-turn

00:17:35.746 --> 00:17:37.886 A:middle
navigation applications, but for

00:17:37.886 --> 00:17:39.226 A:middle
things like augmented reality,

00:17:39.436 --> 00:17:40.496 A:middle
this may make less sense.

00:17:40.846 --> 00:17:42.296 A:middle
I encourage you to check out

00:17:42.296 --> 00:17:43.666 A:middle
CoreLocation's section on

00:17:43.666 --> 00:17:45.266 A:middle
Thursday for more details.

00:17:46.596 --> 00:17:48.126 A:middle
Now, another way you could

00:17:48.126 --> 00:17:49.806 A:middle
consider getting heading is by

00:17:49.806 --> 00:17:51.376 A:middle
calculating it from the attitude

00:17:51.376 --> 00:17:53.276 A:middle
estimation that we provide in

00:17:53.276 --> 00:17:54.066 A:middle
DeviceMotion.

00:17:54.586 --> 00:17:56.266 A:middle
However, getting this right in

00:17:56.266 --> 00:17:57.476 A:middle
all circumstances is

00:17:57.476 --> 00:17:59.946 A:middle
non-trivial; and this is why

00:18:00.336 --> 00:18:01.876 A:middle
this year, we're adding heading

00:18:01.876 --> 00:18:03.716 A:middle
as a first-class property in

00:18:03.716 --> 00:18:04.546 A:middle
DeviceMotion.

00:18:05.896 --> 00:18:07.716 A:middle
Heading fuses together the

00:18:07.716 --> 00:18:09.276 A:middle
accelerometer, the gyroscope and

00:18:09.276 --> 00:18:09.896 A:middle
most importantly, the

00:18:09.896 --> 00:18:11.306 A:middle
magnetometer, to give us the

00:18:11.306 --> 00:18:12.736 A:middle
direction the device is pointing

00:18:12.736 --> 00:18:13.656 A:middle
with respect to north.

00:18:15.366 --> 00:18:16.746 A:middle
Keep in mind that heading is

00:18:16.746 --> 00:18:19.026 A:middle
only available on iOS, where the

00:18:19.026 --> 00:18:20.206 A:middle
magnetic field property is

00:18:20.206 --> 00:18:20.606 A:middle
available.

00:18:22.156 --> 00:18:23.576 A:middle
Now, let's take a closer look at

00:18:23.576 --> 00:18:23.976 A:middle
the API.

00:18:25.386 --> 00:18:27.066 A:middle
Heading is only valid for the

00:18:27.066 --> 00:18:28.986 A:middle
xMagneticNorth and xTrueNorth

00:18:28.986 --> 00:18:29.766 A:middle
reference frames.

00:18:30.126 --> 00:18:31.106 A:middle
For the other two reference

00:18:31.106 --> 00:18:32.146 A:middle
frames, you'll receive a

00:18:32.146 --> 00:18:33.326 A:middle
negative value back from

00:18:33.326 --> 00:18:36.426 A:middle
heading, and heading will give

00:18:36.426 --> 00:18:39.586 A:middle
you from 0 to 359 degrees from

00:18:39.586 --> 00:18:41.546 A:middle
the X axis that you've chosen in

00:18:41.546 --> 00:18:42.856 A:middle
your application, either

00:18:42.856 --> 00:18:44.356 A:middle
MagneticNorth or TrueNorth.

00:18:44.986 --> 00:18:48.016 A:middle
Now that we have heading, we

00:18:48.016 --> 00:18:49.776 A:middle
could use that to overlay the

00:18:49.776 --> 00:18:50.936 A:middle
Golden Gate Bridge on the

00:18:50.936 --> 00:18:52.606 A:middle
horizon in the direction that it

00:18:52.606 --> 00:18:52.916 A:middle
actually is.

00:18:55.946 --> 00:18:57.496 A:middle
Now, with DeviceMotion, there

00:18:57.496 --> 00:18:58.686 A:middle
are a number of best practices

00:18:58.686 --> 00:18:59.446 A:middle
to keep in mind.

00:19:00.266 --> 00:19:02.226 A:middle
The first is that you want to

00:19:02.226 --> 00:19:03.456 A:middle
make sure that you check for the

00:19:03.456 --> 00:19:04.546 A:middle
availability of a given

00:19:04.546 --> 00:19:06.196 A:middle
reference frame before you start

00:19:06.196 --> 00:19:06.746 A:middle
updates.

00:19:07.566 --> 00:19:09.646 A:middle
And to do that, you can use the

00:19:09.646 --> 00:19:10.966 A:middle
availableAttitudeReference

00:19:10.966 --> 00:19:11.586 A:middle
Frame's API.

00:19:12.216 --> 00:19:13.176 A:middle
This will return you a

00:19:13.336 --> 00:19:15.356 A:middle
CMAttitudeReferenceFrame bitmask

00:19:15.586 --> 00:19:17.016 A:middle
that you can then and, with the

00:19:17.016 --> 00:19:17.856 A:middle
reference frame that you are

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:19.136 A:middle
interested in, to determine

00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:19.756 A:middle
availability.

00:19:21.086 --> 00:19:22.736 A:middle
And the next thing to keep in

00:19:22.736 --> 00:19:23.866 A:middle
mind is that the choice of

00:19:23.866 --> 00:19:25.556 A:middle
reference frame is key for your

00:19:25.556 --> 00:19:26.326 A:middle
applications.

00:19:26.506 --> 00:19:28.416 A:middle
This is going to determine how

00:19:28.416 --> 00:19:29.876 A:middle
attitude is calculated in your

00:19:29.876 --> 00:19:32.246 A:middle
applications, as well as which

00:19:32.246 --> 00:19:34.056 A:middle
sensors go into the sensor

00:19:34.056 --> 00:19:34.686 A:middle
fusion.

00:19:36.286 --> 00:19:37.806 A:middle
Now, we've talked about a number

00:19:37.806 --> 00:19:39.686 A:middle
of things in DeviceMotion, but

00:19:39.686 --> 00:19:40.596 A:middle
let's get a little bit more

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:41.146 A:middle
practical.

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:45.126 A:middle
Let's take some of the concepts

00:19:45.266 --> 00:19:46.296 A:middle
that we've talked about in

00:19:46.296 --> 00:19:48.686 A:middle
DeviceMotion and put them into

00:19:48.686 --> 00:19:50.516 A:middle
practice using a game.

00:19:51.466 --> 00:19:53.076 A:middle
Badger with Attitude is a game

00:19:53.256 --> 00:19:54.246 A:middle
where we're going to apply

00:19:54.536 --> 00:19:56.776 A:middle
DeviceMotion to translate into

00:19:56.776 --> 00:19:58.616 A:middle
controls for the game, and for

00:19:58.616 --> 00:19:59.806 A:middle
that, I'd like to invite my

00:19:59.806 --> 00:20:01.516 A:middle
co-worker, Ahmad to the stage to

00:20:01.516 --> 00:20:02.326 A:middle
walk us through this.

00:20:03.516 --> 00:20:07.500 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:20:14.396 --> 00:20:15.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, John.

00:20:16.676 --> 00:20:17.576 A:middle
Hello, and welcome.

00:20:18.346 --> 00:20:19.406 A:middle
Today, I'm going to be taking

00:20:19.406 --> 00:20:21.246 A:middle
some of those concepts that John

00:20:21.246 --> 00:20:22.606 A:middle
just talked about and help you

00:20:22.606 --> 00:20:23.656 A:middle
put them through a practical

00:20:23.656 --> 00:20:24.126 A:middle
example.

00:20:24.876 --> 00:20:26.106 A:middle
My name is Ahmad, and I'm an

00:20:26.106 --> 00:20:27.256 A:middle
engineer on the Core Motion

00:20:27.256 --> 00:20:27.536 A:middle
team.

00:20:29.036 --> 00:20:30.296 A:middle
I'll be using the Badger app,

00:20:30.446 --> 00:20:31.666 A:middle
which has been developed by our

00:20:31.666 --> 00:20:32.946 A:middle
colleagues over at SceneKit.

00:20:33.546 --> 00:20:34.626 A:middle
You may have seen this app in

00:20:34.626 --> 00:20:35.456 A:middle
last year's session.

00:20:36.096 --> 00:20:37.476 A:middle
In it, you play a cute little

00:20:37.476 --> 00:20:38.686 A:middle
badger called Bob.

00:20:39.106 --> 00:20:41.156 A:middle
He sits in a mining cart rolling

00:20:41.156 --> 00:20:42.766 A:middle
down some tracks, selecting gems

00:20:42.766 --> 00:20:43.876 A:middle
and power-ups along the way.

00:20:44.466 --> 00:20:46.566 A:middle
So we're going to take this app

00:20:46.566 --> 00:20:48.886 A:middle
with existing swipe controls and

00:20:49.046 --> 00:20:50.946 A:middle
use DeviceMotion to transform it

00:20:51.376 --> 00:20:52.806 A:middle
to motion-based gestures.

00:20:53.236 --> 00:20:58.546 A:middle
Here's what we've got in store

00:20:58.546 --> 00:21:00.396 A:middle
for you today: First, we're

00:21:00.396 --> 00:21:01.556 A:middle
going to talk about the existing

00:21:01.556 --> 00:21:03.186 A:middle
controls and what we're trying

00:21:03.186 --> 00:21:03.926 A:middle
to accomplish.

00:21:04.816 --> 00:21:06.446 A:middle
Then we'll show you some of the

00:21:06.446 --> 00:21:08.126 A:middle
basics of using DeviceMotion.

00:21:08.906 --> 00:21:10.456 A:middle
And finally, the algorithms we

00:21:10.456 --> 00:21:12.046 A:middle
use to detect those gestures.

00:21:12.586 --> 00:21:16.206 A:middle
So the Badger app allows you to

00:21:16.206 --> 00:21:17.746 A:middle
swipe your finger up across the

00:21:17.746 --> 00:21:19.206 A:middle
screen to make the badger jump,

00:21:20.186 --> 00:21:21.166 A:middle
and if you swipe your finger

00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:22.956 A:middle
down, the badger ducks and hides

00:21:22.956 --> 00:21:24.226 A:middle
inside the card to avoid the

00:21:24.226 --> 00:21:24.746 A:middle
obstacles.

00:21:25.876 --> 00:21:27.366 A:middle
And swiping left or right will

00:21:27.366 --> 00:21:29.306 A:middle
make the badger swing to reach

00:21:29.306 --> 00:21:30.196 A:middle
out for those gems.

00:21:31.406 --> 00:21:33.176 A:middle
If you've worked on beautiful

00:21:33.176 --> 00:21:34.346 A:middle
graphics like these, it's a

00:21:34.346 --> 00:21:35.356 A:middle
shame to have to hide them

00:21:35.356 --> 00:21:36.516 A:middle
behind your finger while you

00:21:36.516 --> 00:21:37.086 A:middle
play the game.

00:21:38.516 --> 00:21:39.596 A:middle
So let's use the phone as our

00:21:39.596 --> 00:21:42.456 A:middle
controller here and have the

00:21:42.456 --> 00:21:43.806 A:middle
user fully immersed in the

00:21:43.806 --> 00:21:45.156 A:middle
experience that we've built for

00:21:47.136 --> 00:21:47.266 A:middle
them.

00:21:47.456 --> 00:21:48.806 A:middle
So first, we'll detect if the

00:21:48.806 --> 00:21:50.656 A:middle
user has rotated the device

00:21:50.686 --> 00:21:52.226 A:middle
towards them to make the badger

00:21:52.226 --> 00:21:52.636 A:middle
jump up.

00:21:54.456 --> 00:21:55.856 A:middle
A slight bump in the device

00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:57.336 A:middle
downwards will make the badger

00:21:57.336 --> 00:21:58.906 A:middle
squat and hide in the cart.

00:21:59.796 --> 00:22:02.346 A:middle
And tilting the device left or

00:22:02.346 --> 00:22:04.226 A:middle
right will make the badger lean

00:22:04.226 --> 00:22:04.786 A:middle
either way.

00:22:05.336 --> 00:22:09.256 A:middle
Now I want you to focus on those

00:22:09.256 --> 00:22:11.646 A:middle
couple of points and think about

00:22:11.646 --> 00:22:12.966 A:middle
them when you're looking at the

00:22:12.966 --> 00:22:15.126 A:middle
sample code later, or thinking

00:22:15.126 --> 00:22:16.556 A:middle
about incorporating motion into

00:22:16.556 --> 00:22:17.366 A:middle
your application.

00:22:17.876 --> 00:22:20.646 A:middle
As John has mentioned earlier,

00:22:20.726 --> 00:22:22.236 A:middle
Core Motion allows you to

00:22:22.316 --> 00:22:23.386 A:middle
interact directly with the

00:22:23.386 --> 00:22:23.896 A:middle
sensors.

00:22:24.776 --> 00:22:25.966 A:middle
Let's take the accelerometer,

00:22:25.966 --> 00:22:26.636 A:middle
for example.

00:22:27.926 --> 00:22:29.616 A:middle
That input may look fine as long

00:22:29.616 --> 00:22:31.246 A:middle
as the user is semi-stationary,

00:22:31.506 --> 00:22:32.946 A:middle
but if you start walking around

00:22:32.946 --> 00:22:34.846 A:middle
or get on a bus, then you're

00:22:34.846 --> 00:22:35.776 A:middle
going to have to account for

00:22:35.776 --> 00:22:37.236 A:middle
these additional accelerations.

00:22:38.286 --> 00:22:39.756 A:middle
So with DeviceMotion, we've

00:22:39.756 --> 00:22:41.216 A:middle
taken other sensors like the

00:22:41.216 --> 00:22:43.046 A:middle
gyro and the magnetometer that

00:22:43.046 --> 00:22:44.296 A:middle
complement the accelerometer

00:22:44.296 --> 00:22:46.346 A:middle
really well, and we fuse those

00:22:46.346 --> 00:22:48.576 A:middle
inputs for you so we can

00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:50.016 A:middle
minimize those environmental

00:22:50.016 --> 00:22:51.876 A:middle
factors and let you focus on

00:22:51.876 --> 00:22:53.746 A:middle
capturing those motion controls

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:56.446 A:middle
rather than how to process the

00:22:57.606 --> 00:22:58.286 A:middle
sensor input.

00:22:58.896 --> 00:23:01.276 A:middle
The DeviceMotion APIs allow you

00:23:01.276 --> 00:23:03.336 A:middle
to query for samples in two

00:23:03.336 --> 00:23:06.126 A:middle
different ways, the push and the

00:23:06.126 --> 00:23:06.996 A:middle
pull mechanisms.

00:23:07.376 --> 00:23:09.396 A:middle
Let's take a close look at those

00:23:10.106 --> 00:23:10.176 A:middle
two.

00:23:12.196 --> 00:23:13.886 A:middle
The push mechanism is a great

00:23:13.886 --> 00:23:15.576 A:middle
way for you to detect a discrete

00:23:15.576 --> 00:23:17.336 A:middle
gesture across a small window of

00:23:17.336 --> 00:23:17.656 A:middle
time.

00:23:19.046 --> 00:23:21.216 A:middle
In the SwingWatch app from last

00:23:21.216 --> 00:23:23.716 A:middle
year's session, we used the push

00:23:23.716 --> 00:23:25.376 A:middle
mechanism so that the framework

00:23:25.376 --> 00:23:27.226 A:middle
will push to us updates as they

00:23:27.226 --> 00:23:28.906 A:middle
are available at a fixed

00:23:29.206 --> 00:23:29.666 A:middle
interval.

00:23:31.026 --> 00:23:32.056 A:middle
Then we would capture those

00:23:32.056 --> 00:23:34.256 A:middle
updates and detect if the user

00:23:34.256 --> 00:23:35.746 A:middle
swung their arm to perform a

00:23:35.746 --> 00:23:36.906 A:middle
backhand or a forehand.

00:23:38.936 --> 00:23:40.696 A:middle
This is what the API looks like.

00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:43.076 A:middle
You use the CMMotionManager's

00:23:43.436 --> 00:23:44.746 A:middle
start DeviceMotion updates

00:23:44.746 --> 00:23:46.626 A:middle
function; you provide a

00:23:46.626 --> 00:23:48.076 A:middle
reference frame of interest,

00:23:49.466 --> 00:23:51.606 A:middle
provide an operation cue for

00:23:51.606 --> 00:23:53.206 A:middle
your motionHandler to run on as

00:23:53.206 --> 00:23:54.556 A:middle
soon as those samples are ready.

00:23:57.156 --> 00:24:00.416 A:middle
However, if you want to know

00:24:00.416 --> 00:24:01.486 A:middle
what the current state of the

00:24:01.486 --> 00:24:04.126 A:middle
device is, then you want to use

00:24:04.126 --> 00:24:05.226 A:middle
the pull mechanism here.

00:24:05.836 --> 00:24:07.266 A:middle
As we'll show you later on in

00:24:07.266 --> 00:24:09.086 A:middle
the Badger app for the tilt

00:24:09.156 --> 00:24:11.366 A:middle
gesture, we want to make the

00:24:11.366 --> 00:24:13.366 A:middle
Badger lean at the same angle

00:24:13.366 --> 00:24:14.406 A:middle
that the phone is in.

00:24:15.316 --> 00:24:17.526 A:middle
So we ensure we provide the

00:24:17.526 --> 00:24:19.386 A:middle
responsive and smooth experience

00:24:20.016 --> 00:24:21.426 A:middle
for our graphical application.

00:24:23.056 --> 00:24:24.996 A:middle
The API for the pull mechanism

00:24:24.996 --> 00:24:25.826 A:middle
is a bit simpler.

00:24:26.416 --> 00:24:26.836 A:middle
You call

00:24:26.836 --> 00:24:28.756 A:middle
startDeviceMotionUpdates, and

00:24:28.756 --> 00:24:30.036 A:middle
you provide the reference frame;

00:24:31.006 --> 00:24:32.156 A:middle
and whenever you're ready, you

00:24:32.156 --> 00:24:33.376 A:middle
can pull for the latest

00:24:33.376 --> 00:24:34.916 A:middle
DeviceMotion sample from the

00:24:34.916 --> 00:24:35.366 A:middle
framework.

00:24:35.856 --> 00:24:39.226 A:middle
We'll be releasing the sample

00:24:39.226 --> 00:24:40.446 A:middle
code for use, so you'll be able

00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:42.516 A:middle
to take a look at it later, but

00:24:42.516 --> 00:24:43.736 A:middle
let's focus on the Core Motion

00:24:43.736 --> 00:24:44.336 A:middle
parts for now.

00:24:44.956 --> 00:24:47.376 A:middle
So to get start with them for

00:24:47.376 --> 00:24:49.216 A:middle
the Core Motion framework and

00:24:49.216 --> 00:24:50.616 A:middle
then instantiate an instance of

00:24:50.616 --> 00:24:51.696 A:middle
the CMMotionManager.

00:24:52.936 --> 00:24:54.796 A:middle
Then we'll check if DeviceMotion

00:24:54.796 --> 00:24:56.236 A:middle
updates are available on this

00:24:56.236 --> 00:24:56.756 A:middle
platform.

00:24:57.266 --> 00:25:00.026 A:middle
And if you recall from John's

00:25:00.026 --> 00:25:02.126 A:middle
talk, the tip and tilt gestures

00:25:02.126 --> 00:25:03.806 A:middle
that we're interested in track

00:25:03.806 --> 00:25:05.406 A:middle
where gravity is in the device

00:25:05.406 --> 00:25:05.656 A:middle
frame.

00:25:06.386 --> 00:25:08.116 A:middle
So we'll be using the

00:25:08.116 --> 00:25:09.896 A:middle
xArbitraryZVertical reference

00:25:09.896 --> 00:25:11.626 A:middle
frame, and we'll check if it's

00:25:11.626 --> 00:25:12.646 A:middle
available on the platform.

00:25:13.606 --> 00:25:15.616 A:middle
You may have noticed I did not

00:25:15.906 --> 00:25:17.526 A:middle
check for the authorization

00:25:17.526 --> 00:25:18.686 A:middle
here, and that's because I'm

00:25:18.686 --> 00:25:20.096 A:middle
using the MotionManager API,

00:25:20.416 --> 00:25:22.506 A:middle
which does not access sensitive

00:25:22.506 --> 00:25:22.796 A:middle
data.

00:25:24.766 --> 00:25:27.896 A:middle
For the rest of the talk, we'll

00:25:27.896 --> 00:25:29.866 A:middle
assume the device is in the

00:25:29.906 --> 00:25:31.116 A:middle
[inaudible] orientation, but in

00:25:31.116 --> 00:25:32.246 A:middle
the sample code, we'll show you

00:25:32.246 --> 00:25:34.306 A:middle
how to detect and handle other

00:25:34.306 --> 00:25:35.406 A:middle
device orientations.

00:25:38.956 --> 00:25:41.126 A:middle
For the first gesture, when

00:25:41.336 --> 00:25:42.976 A:middle
rotating the device towards you

00:25:43.186 --> 00:25:45.296 A:middle
makes the badger jump up, we

00:25:45.296 --> 00:25:47.366 A:middle
want to capture the magnitude of

00:25:47.366 --> 00:25:49.156 A:middle
that rotation rate along the

00:25:49.156 --> 00:25:50.986 A:middle
horizontal axis of the phone.

00:25:51.736 --> 00:25:53.206 A:middle
In this case, it's the Y-axis.

00:25:55.816 --> 00:25:57.286 A:middle
So we'll be looking at the

00:25:57.286 --> 00:25:59.836 A:middle
rotation rate property from the

00:25:59.836 --> 00:26:00.906 A:middle
DeviceMotion object.

00:26:01.486 --> 00:26:02.946 A:middle
And we chose that specifically

00:26:02.946 --> 00:26:04.736 A:middle
because we're not interested in

00:26:04.736 --> 00:26:06.376 A:middle
the current angle the device is

00:26:06.376 --> 00:26:08.056 A:middle
making, but rather a quick

00:26:08.056 --> 00:26:09.006 A:middle
change in that angle.

00:26:10.286 --> 00:26:12.046 A:middle
So if we use the rotation rate,

00:26:12.096 --> 00:26:14.246 A:middle
we'll be able to detect a quick

00:26:14.316 --> 00:26:16.036 A:middle
pulse and make the badger jump

00:26:16.036 --> 00:26:16.646 A:middle
accordingly.

00:26:17.136 --> 00:26:19.676 A:middle
This is a gesture that we're

00:26:19.676 --> 00:26:21.786 A:middle
detecting across a small period

00:26:21.786 --> 00:26:23.156 A:middle
of time, so we're going to be

00:26:23.156 --> 00:26:26.346 A:middle
using the push mechanism for it.

00:26:26.616 --> 00:26:27.606 A:middle
Let's see how that will look in

00:26:27.606 --> 00:26:27.976 A:middle
the code.

00:26:28.606 --> 00:26:31.106 A:middle
To start off, we'll set the

00:26:31.106 --> 00:26:32.666 A:middle
update interval to 50 hertz.

00:26:33.176 --> 00:26:34.176 A:middle
And you want to be careful when

00:26:34.176 --> 00:26:34.736 A:middle
you set that.

00:26:35.466 --> 00:26:36.496 A:middle
You want the samples to be

00:26:36.496 --> 00:26:38.006 A:middle
coming in fast enough so that

00:26:38.006 --> 00:26:39.406 A:middle
you can capture that gesture;

00:26:39.876 --> 00:26:41.126 A:middle
but not too fast that you're

00:26:41.126 --> 00:26:42.626 A:middle
increasing your computational

00:26:42.976 --> 00:26:44.206 A:middle
and memory requirements.

00:26:45.656 --> 00:26:47.716 A:middle
Then we'll start DeviceMotion

00:26:47.716 --> 00:26:49.696 A:middle
updates using the push

00:26:49.696 --> 00:26:51.416 A:middle
mechanism, provide our

00:26:51.416 --> 00:26:53.166 A:middle
xArbitraryZVertical reference

00:26:53.166 --> 00:26:56.216 A:middle
frame, a queue, and I'm using a

00:26:56.216 --> 00:26:58.586 A:middle
standard operation cue here, and

00:26:58.586 --> 00:26:59.796 A:middle
finally, our motionHandler.

00:27:02.636 --> 00:27:04.186 A:middle
This is what our motionHandler

00:27:04.186 --> 00:27:04.686 A:middle
will look like.

00:27:04.946 --> 00:27:06.426 A:middle
It will get called as soon as

00:27:06.426 --> 00:27:07.206 A:middle
samples are ready.

00:27:07.926 --> 00:27:08.966 A:middle
The first thing we'll do is

00:27:08.966 --> 00:27:11.606 A:middle
check for any errors and then

00:27:11.606 --> 00:27:13.076 A:middle
grab that rotation rate from the

00:27:13.076 --> 00:27:15.426 A:middle
DeviceMotion object, and look at

00:27:15.696 --> 00:27:17.516 A:middle
the Y-component that we were

00:27:17.516 --> 00:27:18.776 A:middle
interested in.

00:27:19.336 --> 00:27:21.016 A:middle
Then we store that in a buffer,

00:27:21.416 --> 00:27:22.436 A:middle
and I'm using the circular

00:27:22.436 --> 00:27:24.296 A:middle
buffer here, so as soon as the

00:27:24.296 --> 00:27:25.656 A:middle
samples are coming in, we'll

00:27:25.656 --> 00:27:29.566 A:middle
accumulate more of them.

00:27:29.966 --> 00:27:31.226 A:middle
Since we're using the SceneKit

00:27:31.226 --> 00:27:33.266 A:middle
renderer for this application, I

00:27:33.266 --> 00:27:34.126 A:middle
chose the renderer's

00:27:34.126 --> 00:27:35.336 A:middle
updateAtTime function.

00:27:35.826 --> 00:27:37.256 A:middle
This will get called just before

00:27:37.296 --> 00:27:40.046 A:middle
you render a new scene, and this

00:27:40.046 --> 00:27:41.286 A:middle
is the ideal place for me to

00:27:41.286 --> 00:27:42.396 A:middle
check for the state of that

00:27:42.396 --> 00:27:44.576 A:middle
buffer and then update the game.

00:27:45.106 --> 00:27:47.986 A:middle
And I'll leave it up to you to

00:27:47.986 --> 00:27:48.746 A:middle
find out where in the

00:27:48.746 --> 00:27:50.136 A:middle
application is the best place to

00:27:50.136 --> 00:27:51.126 A:middle
do that.

00:27:52.766 --> 00:27:54.426 A:middle
And then I simply check if the

00:27:54.426 --> 00:27:55.816 A:middle
mean of that buffer has crossed

00:27:55.816 --> 00:27:57.336 A:middle
a certain threshold and make the

00:27:57.336 --> 00:27:58.306 A:middle
badger jump.

00:27:59.676 --> 00:28:01.286 A:middle
Keep in mind this threshold is

00:28:01.336 --> 00:28:03.216 A:middle
tunable and adjustable to your

00:28:03.216 --> 00:28:04.256 A:middle
app's specific needs.

00:28:08.316 --> 00:28:10.446 A:middle
Next, we'll take a look at the

00:28:10.446 --> 00:28:12.166 A:middle
second control, where bumping

00:28:12.166 --> 00:28:13.746 A:middle
the device downwards will make

00:28:13.746 --> 00:28:14.976 A:middle
the badger duck.

00:28:16.386 --> 00:28:18.216 A:middle
For this one, we want to measure

00:28:18.216 --> 00:28:20.996 A:middle
the user acceleration along the

00:28:20.996 --> 00:28:22.136 A:middle
gravity vector.

00:28:25.076 --> 00:28:26.636 A:middle
So we'll be looking at the user

00:28:26.636 --> 00:28:29.116 A:middle
acceleration property, and here

00:28:29.116 --> 00:28:31.526 A:middle
we chose that because even if

00:28:31.526 --> 00:28:33.326 A:middle
the device is slightly tilted or

00:28:33.326 --> 00:28:35.166 A:middle
rotated at an angle, the user

00:28:35.166 --> 00:28:36.536 A:middle
acceleration is going to still

00:28:36.536 --> 00:28:38.436 A:middle
look the same regardless of the

00:28:38.436 --> 00:28:39.036 A:middle
attitude.

00:28:43.316 --> 00:28:45.546 A:middle
So this is one of the gestures

00:28:45.546 --> 00:28:47.126 A:middle
again that we're detecting over

00:28:47.126 --> 00:28:48.446 A:middle
a window of time, so we'll use

00:28:48.446 --> 00:28:49.706 A:middle
the push mechanism as well.

00:28:51.386 --> 00:28:52.546 A:middle
Since we're already set up for

00:28:52.546 --> 00:28:54.576 A:middle
the push mechanism, we'll head

00:28:54.576 --> 00:28:56.246 A:middle
back to our motionHandler, where

00:28:56.246 --> 00:28:57.646 A:middle
we were storing those rotation

00:28:57.646 --> 00:28:58.496 A:middle
rates previously.

00:28:59.006 --> 00:29:02.106 A:middle
But this time, we'll put out the

00:29:02.106 --> 00:29:03.806 A:middle
gravity property out of the

00:29:03.806 --> 00:29:07.116 A:middle
DeviceMotion object and the user

00:29:07.116 --> 00:29:08.146 A:middle
acceleration as well.

00:29:08.686 --> 00:29:11.916 A:middle
We compute the magnitude of that

00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:13.716 A:middle
user acceleration along the

00:29:13.716 --> 00:29:17.536 A:middle
gravity vector and store that in

00:29:17.536 --> 00:29:17.896 A:middle
a buffer.

00:29:18.626 --> 00:29:21.306 A:middle
And once the mean of that buffer

00:29:21.306 --> 00:29:22.666 A:middle
crosses a certain threshold,

00:29:23.236 --> 00:29:24.696 A:middle
then we'll make the badger duck

00:29:24.696 --> 00:29:27.366 A:middle
down and hide in the cart.

00:29:28.136 --> 00:29:29.826 A:middle
So we've taken a look at two

00:29:29.826 --> 00:29:31.886 A:middle
controls where we were

00:29:31.886 --> 00:29:33.506 A:middle
monitoring motion across a small

00:29:33.506 --> 00:29:35.266 A:middle
window of time and we used the

00:29:35.266 --> 00:29:36.346 A:middle
push mechanism for that.

00:29:37.216 --> 00:29:38.716 A:middle
Let's take a look at our final

00:29:38.766 --> 00:29:40.976 A:middle
control, where our requirements

00:29:40.976 --> 00:29:43.816 A:middle
are slightly different.

00:29:44.826 --> 00:29:48.046 A:middle
For the tilt control, in the

00:29:48.046 --> 00:29:49.686 A:middle
simple case where the device is

00:29:49.686 --> 00:29:52.976 A:middle
held in a vertical position, you

00:29:52.976 --> 00:29:54.206 A:middle
can break down the gravity

00:29:54.206 --> 00:29:56.236 A:middle
vector into its x-component and

00:29:56.236 --> 00:29:59.236 A:middle
its y-component; and by applying

00:29:59.236 --> 00:30:00.816 A:middle
simple trigonometry, you can

00:30:00.816 --> 00:30:01.646 A:middle
arrive at the tilt.

00:30:03.006 --> 00:30:05.086 A:middle
But since we want this gesture

00:30:05.086 --> 00:30:06.476 A:middle
to be slightly more flexible,

00:30:07.186 --> 00:30:08.636 A:middle
we're going to break gravity

00:30:08.636 --> 00:30:10.306 A:middle
into its y-component; and its

00:30:10.306 --> 00:30:12.586 A:middle
component in the x-z plane of

00:30:12.586 --> 00:30:13.216 A:middle
the device.

00:30:14.066 --> 00:30:15.386 A:middle
This will allow us to tilt the

00:30:15.386 --> 00:30:19.826 A:middle
phone even if the device is

00:30:19.826 --> 00:30:21.286 A:middle
slightly rotated at an angle.

00:30:22.576 --> 00:30:23.856 A:middle
What's different about this

00:30:23.856 --> 00:30:25.326 A:middle
control is that we want to know

00:30:25.766 --> 00:30:27.296 A:middle
the current state of the device

00:30:27.366 --> 00:30:28.766 A:middle
and not a discrete motion that

00:30:28.766 --> 00:30:29.156 A:middle
occurred.

00:30:30.536 --> 00:30:33.486 A:middle
This will allow us to make the

00:30:33.486 --> 00:30:35.416 A:middle
badger lean at the same angle

00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:37.166 A:middle
the device is leaning in and

00:30:37.166 --> 00:30:38.616 A:middle
provide a very responsive

00:30:38.616 --> 00:30:39.286 A:middle
experience.

00:30:39.786 --> 00:30:42.416 A:middle
And for those reasons, we'll be

00:30:42.416 --> 00:30:44.546 A:middle
using the pull mechanism for

00:30:45.026 --> 00:30:47.076 A:middle
this control.

00:30:47.146 --> 00:30:48.366 A:middle
Since we're already set up for

00:30:48.366 --> 00:30:50.656 A:middle
the push mechanism, the

00:30:50.656 --> 00:30:51.996 A:middle
framework is ready for us to

00:30:51.996 --> 00:30:54.396 A:middle
pull for samples at any point in

00:30:54.396 --> 00:30:54.716 A:middle
time.

00:30:56.716 --> 00:30:58.606 A:middle
So we'll go back to our renderer

00:30:58.606 --> 00:30:59.226 A:middle
function.

00:30:59.456 --> 00:31:00.626 A:middle
If you recall, this is getting

00:31:00.626 --> 00:31:02.356 A:middle
called just before you render a

00:31:02.356 --> 00:31:02.886 A:middle
new scene.

00:31:03.616 --> 00:31:05.406 A:middle
That makes it a perfect place

00:31:05.406 --> 00:31:06.926 A:middle
for me to pull for the latest

00:31:06.926 --> 00:31:09.076 A:middle
sample, make a calculation, and

00:31:09.076 --> 00:31:12.516 A:middle
then update the graphics.

00:31:12.516 --> 00:31:13.756 A:middle
So we'll ask the MotionManager

00:31:13.756 --> 00:31:14.986 A:middle
for the latest DeviceMotion

00:31:14.986 --> 00:31:18.016 A:middle
sample, grab the gravity

00:31:18.016 --> 00:31:22.096 A:middle
property out of it, compute the

00:31:22.096 --> 00:31:23.546 A:middle
vector and the x-z plane, and

00:31:23.976 --> 00:31:28.446 A:middle
arrive at the tilt as the atan

00:31:28.446 --> 00:31:30.246 A:middle
between that x-z-component and

00:31:30.246 --> 00:31:31.056 A:middle
the y-component.

00:31:31.546 --> 00:31:34.686 A:middle
Don't forget to let the

00:31:34.686 --> 00:31:36.176 A:middle
framework know that you're no

00:31:36.176 --> 00:31:37.076 A:middle
longer interested in

00:31:37.076 --> 00:31:39.106 A:middle
DeviceMotion updates if they

00:31:39.106 --> 00:31:40.186 A:middle
were previously active.

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:42.556 A:middle
This is a great thing to do when

00:31:42.556 --> 00:31:44.166 A:middle
your game is paused or has ended

00:31:45.126 --> 00:31:46.786 A:middle
to make sure you're not wasting

00:31:46.786 --> 00:31:47.856 A:middle
more battery than you need.

00:31:48.846 --> 00:31:50.246 A:middle
So here you see the results.

00:31:50.866 --> 00:31:52.426 A:middle
The user is able to play the

00:31:52.426 --> 00:31:54.766 A:middle
game by tilting the device from

00:31:54.766 --> 00:31:57.326 A:middle
side to side to make the badger

00:31:57.326 --> 00:32:00.036 A:middle
lean either way, and tipping the

00:32:00.036 --> 00:32:01.436 A:middle
device towards them makes the

00:32:01.436 --> 00:32:05.936 A:middle
badger jump up, and finally, a

00:32:05.936 --> 00:32:07.086 A:middle
small push of the device

00:32:07.086 --> 00:32:08.446 A:middle
downwards will make the badger

00:32:08.446 --> 00:32:10.026 A:middle
squat and hide inside the cart.

00:32:10.496 --> 00:32:13.546 A:middle
It's pretty cool, we've taken an

00:32:13.606 --> 00:32:15.576 A:middle
app with swipe controls and used

00:32:15.576 --> 00:32:17.926 A:middle
DeviceMotion to replace them

00:32:17.926 --> 00:32:18.856 A:middle
with motion-based ones.

00:32:27.386 --> 00:32:29.126 A:middle
I'm excited to see how far you

00:32:29.126 --> 00:32:30.636 A:middle
can push the DeviceMotion APIs.

00:32:35.516 --> 00:32:44.576 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:32:45.076 --> 00:32:46.196 A:middle
So to wrap up some of the key

00:32:46.196 --> 00:32:47.246 A:middle
points that we talked about

00:32:47.306 --> 00:32:50.276 A:middle
today, we encourage you to look

00:32:50.276 --> 00:32:52.356 A:middle
at the authorization API and

00:32:52.356 --> 00:32:53.106 A:middle
check for your app's

00:32:53.106 --> 00:32:55.616 A:middle
authorization if you're using

00:32:55.616 --> 00:32:57.226 A:middle
one of the sensitive APIs.

00:32:59.666 --> 00:33:00.986 A:middle
While you might have your use

00:33:00.986 --> 00:33:02.926 A:middle
case for using the sensor data

00:33:02.926 --> 00:33:05.166 A:middle
directly, we encourage you to

00:33:05.166 --> 00:33:07.626 A:middle
look at the DeviceMotion APIs,

00:33:08.016 --> 00:33:09.176 A:middle
because our sensor fusion

00:33:09.176 --> 00:33:10.916 A:middle
algorithms handle the most

00:33:10.916 --> 00:33:11.526 A:middle
common case.

00:33:11.936 --> 00:33:13.026 A:middle
It eliminates those

00:33:13.026 --> 00:33:14.966 A:middle
environmental factors so that

00:33:14.966 --> 00:33:17.126 A:middle
you are able to focus on the

00:33:17.126 --> 00:33:18.496 A:middle
motion controls of your user.

00:33:20.546 --> 00:33:23.346 A:middle
The APIs provide you a smooth

00:33:23.346 --> 00:33:24.936 A:middle
and consistent experience across

00:33:24.936 --> 00:33:26.826 A:middle
all our supported devices, and

00:33:28.056 --> 00:33:29.806 A:middle
we've made enhancements this

00:33:29.806 --> 00:33:31.566 A:middle
release to make sure that when

00:33:31.566 --> 00:33:33.136 A:middle
you query for those updates, you

00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:33.896 A:middle
do that in a very

00:33:33.896 --> 00:33:34.796 A:middle
power-efficient manner.

00:33:34.796 --> 00:33:40.566 A:middle
Remember the two different ways

00:33:41.076 --> 00:33:43.466 A:middle
to query for updates: Use the

00:33:43.466 --> 00:33:45.226 A:middle
push when you want to detect a

00:33:45.226 --> 00:33:46.846 A:middle
gesture across a small window of

00:33:46.916 --> 00:33:49.786 A:middle
time, and use the pull when

00:33:49.786 --> 00:33:51.816 A:middle
responsiveness is key and you

00:33:51.816 --> 00:33:52.756 A:middle
want to know what the current

00:33:52.756 --> 00:33:57.436 A:middle
state of the device is.

00:33:58.116 --> 00:33:59.196 A:middle
Here are a couple of the

00:33:59.196 --> 00:34:00.356 A:middle
sessions that we think you might

00:34:00.356 --> 00:34:01.196 A:middle
be interested in.

00:34:02.256 --> 00:34:04.436 A:middle
Please check them out, and if

00:34:04.436 --> 00:34:05.366 A:middle
you're interested in learning

00:34:05.366 --> 00:34:06.796 A:middle
more about the Badger app, check

00:34:06.796 --> 00:34:07.826 A:middle
out last year's SceneKit

00:34:07.826 --> 00:34:08.246 A:middle
session.

00:34:09.676 --> 00:34:11.086 A:middle
If you follow this link, you'll

00:34:11.086 --> 00:34:13.446 A:middle
be able to get at the sample

00:34:13.446 --> 00:34:14.496 A:middle
code and other Core Motion

00:34:14.496 --> 00:34:15.286 A:middle
documentation.

00:34:15.816 --> 00:34:19.476 A:middle
We thank you all for being here,

00:34:19.476 --> 00:34:20.596 A:middle
and have a wonderful evening.
