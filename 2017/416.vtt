00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:21.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello!

00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:27.686 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:28.916 A:middle
Thanks for being here.

00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:32.366 A:middle
Thanks for spending part of your

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.206 A:middle
WWDC with us, talking about

00:00:34.476 --> 00:00:36.116 A:middle
teaching with Swift Playgrounds.

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.886 A:middle
My name's Bill Dudney, I'll be

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:39.466 A:middle
joined shortly by my colleague,

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.316 A:middle
Elizabeth, to talk about

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.076 A:middle
teaching with Swift Playgrounds.

00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:44.906 A:middle
So, you might have noticed, over

00:00:44.906 --> 00:00:46.546 A:middle
the last few years we started

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.116 A:middle
with Hour of Code, and even some

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:49.656 A:middle
initiatives before that, that

00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:51.526 A:middle
the whole world is now talking

00:00:51.526 --> 00:00:53.606 A:middle
about people learning about

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:55.416 A:middle
computational thinking, about

00:00:55.416 --> 00:00:56.376 A:middle
how to program.

00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.276 A:middle
In India, in Asia, and Africa,

00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:00.746 A:middle
and the United States.

00:01:00.896 --> 00:01:02.276 A:middle
There's big school systems like

00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:03.876 A:middle
New York and Chicago talking

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:05.346 A:middle
about teaching all of their kids

00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:05.946 A:middle
how to code.

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:08.356 A:middle
Even heffalumps are learning how

00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:08.796 A:middle
to code.

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:10.856 A:middle
Everywhere, everybody is

00:01:10.856 --> 00:01:11.856 A:middle
learning how to code.

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:14.536 A:middle
And, we are really excited about

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:14.836 A:middle
that.

00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:17.146 A:middle
It's such a fantastic time to be

00:01:17.146 --> 00:01:19.426 A:middle
in a place where, to be in a

00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:20.746 A:middle
time, where everyone is starting

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:21.746 A:middle
to talk about coding.

00:01:21.746 --> 00:01:24.956 A:middle
So, our talk today is divided

00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:26.416 A:middle
into two major sections.

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:27.286 A:middle
The first one, I'm going to

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:28.686 A:middle
cover, talking about teaching,

00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:29.996 A:middle
and then Elizabeth is going to

00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:31.166 A:middle
talk about designing and

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.416 A:middle
implementing playgrounds.

00:01:33.096 --> 00:01:34.406 A:middle
But, those two sections have

00:01:34.446 --> 00:01:35.946 A:middle
three main pillars in them.

00:01:35.946 --> 00:01:38.876 A:middle
Goal, passion, and audience.

00:01:39.686 --> 00:01:41.606 A:middle
So, let's get started with

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:43.586 A:middle
teaching, and specifically about

00:01:43.586 --> 00:01:44.236 A:middle
the goal.

00:01:44.606 --> 00:01:46.636 A:middle
Now, as a teacher, you of course

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:47.586 A:middle
have to have a goal.

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:48.996 A:middle
What information is it that you

00:01:48.996 --> 00:01:50.616 A:middle
want to impart to your learners.

00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:52.916 A:middle
But, equally important, is your

00:01:52.916 --> 00:01:53.836 A:middle
learner's goal.

00:01:54.206 --> 00:01:55.496 A:middle
What is it that your learner is

00:01:55.496 --> 00:01:56.446 A:middle
trying to get out of that

00:01:56.446 --> 00:01:56.946 A:middle
content?

00:01:57.276 --> 00:02:00.116 A:middle
They need their goal to be front

00:02:00.116 --> 00:02:01.766 A:middle
and center of the content so

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:02.996 A:middle
that they stay motivated,

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:04.276 A:middle
because while learning to

00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:06.476 A:middle
program is not hard, it does

00:02:06.476 --> 00:02:07.506 A:middle
take hard work.

00:02:08.146 --> 00:02:11.986 A:middle
So, a place where I'm sure many

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:14.566 A:middle
of us have been with mathematics

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:17.226 A:middle
is to either love it, or not,

00:02:17.226 --> 00:02:19.296 A:middle
and I'm sure we all have friends

00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:20.116 A:middle
who don't.

00:02:20.516 --> 00:02:22.116 A:middle
As programmers, probably most of

00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:24.446 A:middle
us are into mathematics.

00:02:24.446 --> 00:02:25.706 A:middle
We've at least played with it,

00:02:25.706 --> 00:02:26.846 A:middle
and done some stuff with it.

00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:28.626 A:middle
The people who don't get it

00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:31.296 A:middle
though, are often, or who aren't

00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:33.316 A:middle
excited by mathematics are often

00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:35.316 A:middle
turned off by it, by some

00:02:35.316 --> 00:02:36.556 A:middle
experience where they end up

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:38.126 A:middle
with this long list of

00:02:38.126 --> 00:02:38.616 A:middle
functions.

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:42.166 A:middle
Polynomials, trig, exponentials,

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:43.846 A:middle
logarithms, their inverses.

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:45.506 A:middle
Solving for "x."

00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:48.176 A:middle
I remember, when I was younger,

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:50.206 A:middle
and sitting in my geometry class

00:02:50.206 --> 00:02:52.256 A:middle
with my teacher, Mr. Carlin, I

00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:54.246 A:middle
would ask him, probably once a

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:57.266 A:middle
week, I was a real pest, "When

00:02:57.266 --> 00:02:59.976 A:middle
am I ever going to use this?"

00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:01.566 A:middle
And, he would look at me and

00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:03.606 A:middle
say, "Please stop asking me that

00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:03.996 A:middle
question."

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:06.286 A:middle
And, eventually, after I've

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:07.716 A:middle
pestered him enough, he said,

00:03:07.806 --> 00:03:09.506 A:middle
"Look, you're probably never

00:03:09.506 --> 00:03:11.226 A:middle
going to use this, but it's

00:03:11.226 --> 00:03:13.796 A:middle
really cool anyway," and that

00:03:13.796 --> 00:03:15.396 A:middle
sort of flipped a bit in my head

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:17.276 A:middle
to go from looking at math as

00:03:17.276 --> 00:03:19.476 A:middle
utilitarian, to looking at math

00:03:19.476 --> 00:03:20.926 A:middle
as something that's beautiful

00:03:20.926 --> 00:03:22.546 A:middle
and fun to mess with, like a

00:03:22.546 --> 00:03:24.076 A:middle
puzzle to solve.

00:03:24.406 --> 00:03:26.106 A:middle
And so, that really struck me,

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:28.346 A:middle
and it turned my direction away

00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:29.766 A:middle
from being frustrated with not

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:30.796 A:middle
having some practical

00:03:30.796 --> 00:03:32.966 A:middle
application for it, to enjoying

00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:34.496 A:middle
it just to solve puzzles.

00:03:34.496 --> 00:03:36.376 A:middle
Now, of course, little did Mr.

00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:37.326 A:middle
Carlin know, that I would

00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:39.436 A:middle
eventually become a nerd, and

00:03:39.626 --> 00:03:41.106 A:middle
deal with geometry all the time,

00:03:41.106 --> 00:03:42.526 A:middle
so thank you, Mr. Carlin, for

00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:44.156 A:middle
teaching me geometry despite my

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:44.716 A:middle
resistance.

00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:50.106 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:51.776 A:middle
So I have a couple of examples

00:03:51.776 --> 00:03:53.396 A:middle
that I use to try to explain

00:03:53.396 --> 00:03:54.746 A:middle
this concept to people, because

00:03:54.746 --> 00:03:56.376 A:middle
I think it's so important that

00:03:56.376 --> 00:03:57.596 A:middle
we think through this, when

00:03:57.596 --> 00:03:58.946 A:middle
we're thinking about teaching.

00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:00.576 A:middle
Now, imagine you're trying to

00:04:00.576 --> 00:04:02.696 A:middle
learn how to do art.

00:04:03.406 --> 00:04:05.786 A:middle
But instead of being artistic,

00:04:05.786 --> 00:04:07.156 A:middle
and spreading paint around a

00:04:07.156 --> 00:04:09.196 A:middle
canvas, instead, you're

00:04:09.696 --> 00:04:12.026 A:middle
encouraged, or forced, to study

00:04:12.406 --> 00:04:14.136 A:middle
the texture of colors, or the

00:04:14.136 --> 00:04:15.976 A:middle
look of the color, or the shape

00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:18.006 A:middle
of the brush, but never able to

00:04:18.006 --> 00:04:18.946 A:middle
apply that paint.

00:04:19.216 --> 00:04:20.726 A:middle
It would be really hard to stay

00:04:20.726 --> 00:04:22.386 A:middle
focused on learning to become an

00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:24.286 A:middle
artist when you can't do art.

00:04:24.616 --> 00:04:26.726 A:middle
People want to create, they want

00:04:26.726 --> 00:04:28.056 A:middle
to build things, or they want to

00:04:28.056 --> 00:04:28.786 A:middle
make things.

00:04:29.286 --> 00:04:30.986 A:middle
And, if you had to study that,

00:04:30.986 --> 00:04:32.226 A:middle
it would be very difficult to

00:04:32.226 --> 00:04:33.416 A:middle
get through it.

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:34.896 A:middle
So much better to let people,

00:04:34.896 --> 00:04:36.126 A:middle
when they're learning to paint

00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:38.336 A:middle
to make a mess, smear the paint

00:04:38.336 --> 00:04:39.456 A:middle
all over the place without

00:04:39.456 --> 00:04:41.276 A:middle
concern, really, for what it

00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:41.796 A:middle
looks like.

00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:43.396 A:middle
You can worry about that later.

00:04:44.056 --> 00:04:45.186 A:middle
Same thing with music.

00:04:45.186 --> 00:04:46.646 A:middle
Imagine if you had to know what

00:04:46.646 --> 00:04:49.066 A:middle
every dot, every line, every arc

00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:51.206 A:middle
on this diagram meant before you

00:04:51.206 --> 00:04:52.906 A:middle
could pick up a guitar, or start

00:04:52.906 --> 00:04:55.896 A:middle
playing with your piano.

00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:57.166 A:middle
It would be very difficult to

00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:58.026 A:middle
get through all that.

00:04:58.736 --> 00:05:00.606 A:middle
So, I encourage people who are

00:05:00.606 --> 00:05:02.136 A:middle
thinking about teaching to start

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:02.946 A:middle
with a question.

00:05:03.446 --> 00:05:05.106 A:middle
That question is what drives the

00:05:05.106 --> 00:05:06.066 A:middle
learner's goal.

00:05:06.396 --> 00:05:08.986 A:middle
From that question, the learner

00:05:08.986 --> 00:05:10.986 A:middle
drives internal motivation to

00:05:10.986 --> 00:05:12.986 A:middle
achieve the hard work of

00:05:12.986 --> 00:05:13.916 A:middle
learning the material you're

00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:15.006 A:middle
trying to get across.

00:05:15.866 --> 00:05:17.356 A:middle
Which brings us next, to the

00:05:17.356 --> 00:05:18.006 A:middle
audience.

00:05:18.646 --> 00:05:20.476 A:middle
It is so important that we as

00:05:20.566 --> 00:05:21.756 A:middle
teachers think through the

00:05:21.756 --> 00:05:23.536 A:middle
audience that we're aiming to

00:05:23.536 --> 00:05:24.006 A:middle
reach.

00:05:24.386 --> 00:05:25.716 A:middle
Are they brand new coders?

00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:27.386 A:middle
Do they understand anything with

00:05:27.386 --> 00:05:27.776 A:middle
coding?

00:05:28.066 --> 00:05:29.406 A:middle
Or, are they moderately

00:05:29.406 --> 00:05:30.526 A:middle
experienced and they're trying

00:05:30.526 --> 00:05:32.096 A:middle
to gain more insight into some

00:05:32.096 --> 00:05:33.376 A:middle
particular piece of material?

00:05:33.816 --> 00:05:34.916 A:middle
You need to know who your

00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:36.676 A:middle
audience is and then make your

00:05:36.676 --> 00:05:38.676 A:middle
content communicate to them.

00:05:40.536 --> 00:05:41.996 A:middle
What I often see happening is

00:05:42.026 --> 00:05:44.796 A:middle
people taking syntax and other

00:05:44.796 --> 00:05:47.056 A:middle
things from a computer science

00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:49.166 A:middle
degree in college and then sort

00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:50.866 A:middle
of moving it down to a level so

00:05:50.866 --> 00:05:52.796 A:middle
younger people can understand

00:05:52.796 --> 00:05:52.926 A:middle
it.

00:05:52.926 --> 00:05:54.516 A:middle
So, you end up with this huge

00:05:54.576 --> 00:05:56.246 A:middle
cloud of concepts that you have

00:05:56.246 --> 00:05:57.976 A:middle
to get down, all these syntax

00:05:57.976 --> 00:05:58.396 A:middle
items.

00:05:58.756 --> 00:06:00.166 A:middle
Now, of course, it's very

00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:02.006 A:middle
important that you understand

00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:04.516 A:middle
syntax, you can't code without

00:06:04.516 --> 00:06:06.526 A:middle
knowing what syntax is, so in

00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:07.686 A:middle
Learn to Code, the way we

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:09.416 A:middle
approach that, is that we build

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:11.016 A:middle
this engaging world with these

00:06:11.016 --> 00:06:12.706 A:middle
great characters and these silly

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.766 A:middle
animations, and beautiful audio

00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:17.766 A:middle
to engage the learner so that

00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:19.046 A:middle
they'll go through the hard work

00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:20.676 A:middle
of learning what a for loop is.

00:06:20.926 --> 00:06:22.276 A:middle
Here's an example of one puzzle

00:06:22.276 --> 00:06:23.646 A:middle
that we have that takes Byte

00:06:23.646 --> 00:06:24.866 A:middle
around the four sides of this

00:06:24.866 --> 00:06:26.246 A:middle
world, picking up gems.

00:06:27.726 --> 00:06:29.036 A:middle
In order to do that, you of

00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:30.336 A:middle
course use a for loop, and we

00:06:30.336 --> 00:06:31.896 A:middle
have that stated at the top of

00:06:31.896 --> 00:06:33.646 A:middle
the page, but that's not the

00:06:33.646 --> 00:06:34.216 A:middle
goal.

00:06:34.216 --> 00:06:35.676 A:middle
The learner's goal is to pick up

00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:37.216 A:middle
these items and to solve the

00:06:37.216 --> 00:06:37.786 A:middle
puzzle.

00:06:37.786 --> 00:06:39.546 A:middle
And so, we use that goal to

00:06:39.546 --> 00:06:41.376 A:middle
drive an internal motivation to

00:06:41.376 --> 00:06:43.266 A:middle
go and learn what a for loop is.

00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:45.626 A:middle
The next step is often to dive

00:06:45.626 --> 00:06:47.596 A:middle
into something like algorithms

00:06:47.596 --> 00:06:48.536 A:middle
and data structures.

00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:52.216 A:middle
I love all these algorithms.

00:06:53.556 --> 00:06:54.716 A:middle
Half of these names, I looked

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:56.196 A:middle
and thought, Hmm, I wonder what

00:06:56.196 --> 00:06:57.366 A:middle
that is, and I almost got

00:06:57.366 --> 00:06:58.566 A:middle
distracted from prepping my

00:06:58.566 --> 00:06:59.996 A:middle
slides by digging into what is

00:06:59.996 --> 00:07:00.556 A:middle
Soundex.

00:07:00.876 --> 00:07:00.943 A:middle
So--

[ Applause ]

00:07:07.546 --> 00:07:08.786 A:middle
I don't know how many of you

00:07:08.786 --> 00:07:09.876 A:middle
have interacted with younger

00:07:09.876 --> 00:07:12.626 A:middle
people, but I doubt very

00:07:12.626 --> 00:07:14.196 A:middle
seriously-- well, many of you

00:07:14.196 --> 00:07:15.336 A:middle
are much younger than me, I

00:07:15.336 --> 00:07:17.316 A:middle
know, but I'm talking about

00:07:17.316 --> 00:07:19.056 A:middle
young learners in school.

00:07:19.826 --> 00:07:21.006 A:middle
How many of them have come to

00:07:21.006 --> 00:07:22.676 A:middle
you with a bucket of integers

00:07:22.676 --> 00:07:24.116 A:middle
and said, "You know, I really

00:07:24.116 --> 00:07:25.236 A:middle
wish you would help me sort

00:07:25.286 --> 00:07:25.726 A:middle
these."

00:07:27.556 --> 00:07:28.636 A:middle
That's never happened.

00:07:29.056 --> 00:07:30.916 A:middle
No one wants to learn about

00:07:30.916 --> 00:07:32.626 A:middle
sorting, they have a goal and

00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:33.966 A:middle
sorting will help them achieve

00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:35.226 A:middle
that goal, so you want to focus

00:07:35.226 --> 00:07:38.246 A:middle
on the audience's goals and then

00:07:38.246 --> 00:07:39.766 A:middle
help them achieve those goals.

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:41.936 A:middle
So, again back here to Learn to

00:07:41.936 --> 00:07:43.406 A:middle
Code, when we're talking about

00:07:43.406 --> 00:07:44.576 A:middle
algorithmic learning and

00:07:44.576 --> 00:07:46.326 A:middle
computational thinking, or when

00:07:46.326 --> 00:07:47.726 A:middle
we're thinking about using those

00:07:47.726 --> 00:07:50.516 A:middle
concepts to teach people, we

00:07:50.516 --> 00:07:52.026 A:middle
build this content like this

00:07:52.026 --> 00:07:53.466 A:middle
same simple puzzle that we saw

00:07:53.466 --> 00:07:54.846 A:middle
earlier, that's drawing the

00:07:54.846 --> 00:07:56.536 A:middle
learner in to thinking about

00:07:56.536 --> 00:07:58.286 A:middle
what an algorithm is, without

00:07:58.286 --> 00:07:59.386 A:middle
even using the word.

00:08:00.116 --> 00:08:01.856 A:middle
Then, later when we get close to

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:04.116 A:middle
the end of Learn to Code 1, we

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:05.276 A:middle
approach this puzzle.

00:08:06.446 --> 00:08:08.476 A:middle
This puzzle is a challenge page

00:08:08.736 --> 00:08:10.606 A:middle
and says to the learner, Hey, go

00:08:10.606 --> 00:08:11.096 A:middle
nuts.

00:08:11.196 --> 00:08:12.626 A:middle
Solve this in any way that you

00:08:12.626 --> 00:08:14.516 A:middle
want to in the most efficient

00:08:14.516 --> 00:08:16.036 A:middle
way that you see possible.

00:08:16.586 --> 00:08:18.476 A:middle
But, this is after a long time

00:08:18.476 --> 00:08:19.636 A:middle
of solving these puzzles where

00:08:19.636 --> 00:08:21.306 A:middle
they start to understand and

00:08:21.406 --> 00:08:23.046 A:middle
think algorithmically, so they

00:08:23.046 --> 00:08:24.346 A:middle
look at this and think, Oh,

00:08:24.346 --> 00:08:25.686 A:middle
there's two diamonds, or there's

00:08:25.686 --> 00:08:27.716 A:middle
two gems, and there's two things

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:28.346 A:middle
I need to flip.

00:08:28.346 --> 00:08:31.056 A:middle
And, that's just programming the

00:08:31.056 --> 00:08:31.796 A:middle
easy parts.

00:08:32.586 --> 00:08:33.896 A:middle
In the beginning, when I started

00:08:33.896 --> 00:08:35.596 A:middle
programming, I would not have

00:08:35.596 --> 00:08:37.776 A:middle
built the WWDC app, properly.

00:08:37.906 --> 00:08:39.116 A:middle
I wouldn't have made a table

00:08:39.116 --> 00:08:41.136 A:middle
view controller and a cell and a

00:08:41.136 --> 00:08:41.646 A:middle
model.

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:42.966 A:middle
I would just dump all the code

00:08:42.966 --> 00:08:43.926 A:middle
into the view controller,

00:08:44.496 --> 00:08:46.906 A:middle
because I read MVC when I first

00:08:46.906 --> 00:08:48.336 A:middle
got started, and I had no idea

00:08:48.336 --> 00:08:49.006 A:middle
what that meant.

00:08:49.426 --> 00:08:50.736 A:middle
Modeling is difficult, the

00:08:50.736 --> 00:08:52.796 A:middle
syntax and the algorithms, and

00:08:52.796 --> 00:08:54.526 A:middle
so forth are the straightforward

00:08:54.526 --> 00:08:54.786 A:middle
part.

00:08:56.006 --> 00:08:57.246 A:middle
So, another thing that I notice

00:08:57.246 --> 00:08:58.926 A:middle
that people get bogged down in

00:08:58.926 --> 00:08:59.866 A:middle
when they're thinking about

00:08:59.866 --> 00:09:01.896 A:middle
teaching this stuff is, to focus

00:09:01.896 --> 00:09:02.916 A:middle
on details.

00:09:03.066 --> 00:09:04.206 A:middle
Now, of course, the details,

00:09:04.206 --> 00:09:05.376 A:middle
they're really important.

00:09:06.076 --> 00:09:07.736 A:middle
Several years ago, I thought, I

00:09:07.736 --> 00:09:09.566 A:middle
really want to learn to do 3D

00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:10.196 A:middle
programming.

00:09:10.196 --> 00:09:11.316 A:middle
I've always thought it's really

00:09:11.316 --> 00:09:13.766 A:middle
cool, I love how fast it is, and

00:09:13.766 --> 00:09:14.826 A:middle
the parallel nature of it.

00:09:15.426 --> 00:09:16.836 A:middle
So, I started diving into Open

00:09:16.836 --> 00:09:17.286 A:middle
GL.

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:19.726 A:middle
Bought a couple of books, and

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.276 A:middle
without question, every one of

00:09:21.276 --> 00:09:22.676 A:middle
those books had this diagram in

00:09:22.676 --> 00:09:22.786 A:middle
it.

00:09:22.786 --> 00:09:24.336 A:middle
So, I'm going to give you a

00:09:24.336 --> 00:09:25.596 A:middle
couple of seconds to look at

00:09:25.596 --> 00:09:26.286 A:middle
this diagram.

00:09:26.286 --> 00:09:27.386 A:middle
Study it hard, there'll be a

00:09:27.386 --> 00:09:27.806 A:middle
test.

00:09:36.596 --> 00:09:38.336 A:middle
Now, here's a picture of a dog

00:09:38.426 --> 00:09:39.386 A:middle
playing with a computer.

00:09:42.186 --> 00:09:43.536 A:middle
Which one did you get more out

00:09:43.536 --> 00:09:43.766 A:middle
of?

00:09:53.106 --> 00:09:53.966 A:middle
So, when you're first getting

00:09:53.966 --> 00:09:55.506 A:middle
started with 3D graphics,

00:09:55.506 --> 00:09:57.066 A:middle
looking at this diagram, it's

00:09:57.066 --> 00:09:58.556 A:middle
very hard to make heads or tails

00:09:58.556 --> 00:09:59.376 A:middle
of it, you might as well be

00:09:59.376 --> 00:09:59.976 A:middle
looking at a picture of a puppy.

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:03.506 A:middle
Instead, what we want to do, is

00:10:03.506 --> 00:10:04.676 A:middle
focus on fun.

00:10:05.036 --> 00:10:06.926 A:middle
3D graphics is amazing.

00:10:07.016 --> 00:10:08.576 A:middle
If I were teaching 3D graphics,

00:10:08.576 --> 00:10:10.486 A:middle
I would start with fun stuff,

00:10:10.486 --> 00:10:13.786 A:middle
like Byte doing his silly dance,

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:14.666 A:middle
right?

00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:16.596 A:middle
He's fantastic, this is so

00:10:16.596 --> 00:10:16.976 A:middle
great.

00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:19.916 A:middle
Now, of course, everything in

00:10:19.916 --> 00:10:22.366 A:middle
that diagram-- vertex shaders

00:10:22.366 --> 00:10:24.416 A:middle
and primitive processing and so

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:25.656 A:middle
forth-- all of that is really

00:10:25.656 --> 00:10:26.946 A:middle
important to getting every

00:10:26.946 --> 00:10:29.526 A:middle
single frame that you see happen

00:10:29.526 --> 00:10:31.396 A:middle
on the screen, onto the screen.

00:10:31.396 --> 00:10:32.926 A:middle
But, you never want to start

00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:33.276 A:middle
there.

00:10:33.606 --> 00:10:35.396 A:middle
You want to start with fun stuff

00:10:35.396 --> 00:10:36.846 A:middle
to get people motivated instead

00:10:36.846 --> 00:10:39.336 A:middle
of bogging them down in details.

00:10:40.976 --> 00:10:42.726 A:middle
Finally, passion.

You, as a teacher, as a

00:10:46.496 --> 00:10:48.306 A:middle

particular things.

00:10:49.806 --> 00:10:51.776 A:middle
You love some piece of computer

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.526 A:middle

00:10:53.526 --> 00:10:55.306 A:middle
about UIKit, or ARKit, or

whatever, and you want to teach

00:10:57.016 --> 00:10:57.266 A:middle
that.

00:10:57.726 --> 00:11:00.846 A:middle
Bring that passion in to how you

00:11:00.846 --> 00:11:02.016 A:middle
approach the teaching.

00:11:02.426 --> 00:11:03.746 A:middle
You want to light the fire of

that passion in the people

00:11:05.146 --> 00:11:06.376 A:middle
you're trying to reach because

00:11:06.376 --> 00:11:08.016 A:middle
that's what will give them the

00:11:08.326 --> 00:11:09.706 A:middle
internal motivation to do the

those ideals: goal, audience,

00:12:23.966 --> 00:12:25.016 A:middle
beginnings of coding.

00:12:25.626 --> 00:12:27.906 A:middle
A Swift Playground is

00:12:27.906 --> 00:12:29.736 A:middle
essentially a collection of

00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:31.596 A:middle
pages, like this one.

00:12:32.156 --> 00:12:35.036 A:middle
You can see on the left hand

00:12:35.036 --> 00:12:36.656 A:middle
side, the prose section.

00:12:36.656 --> 00:12:39.996 A:middle
At the top are the instructions,

00:12:40.236 --> 00:12:42.496 A:middle
the story, whatever concept

00:12:42.496 --> 00:12:43.646 A:middle
you're trying to get across to

00:12:43.646 --> 00:12:44.296 A:middle
your learners.

00:12:45.016 --> 00:12:45.966 A:middle
This is where you're going to

00:12:46.046 --> 00:12:47.176 A:middle
teach them what they're about to

00:12:47.176 --> 00:12:47.586 A:middle
do.

00:12:48.096 --> 00:12:50.656 A:middle
On the bottom, on the right hand

00:12:50.656 --> 00:12:53.056 A:middle
side is the user code section.

00:12:53.566 --> 00:12:54.646 A:middle
This is the fun part where

00:12:54.646 --> 00:12:55.336 A:middle
they're really going to be

00:12:55.336 --> 00:12:57.736 A:middle
creating, manipulating, trying

00:12:57.846 --> 00:12:58.976 A:middle
out what you've taught them.

00:12:59.426 --> 00:13:02.696 A:middle
And then on the right hand side,

00:13:03.146 --> 00:13:03.996 A:middle
the live view.

00:13:05.066 --> 00:13:05.866 A:middle
This is where you're going to

00:13:05.866 --> 00:13:07.696 A:middle
bring your passion to this.

00:13:08.326 --> 00:13:09.996 A:middle
Look how fun this world looks.

00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:11.276 A:middle
I want to dive right in there

00:13:11.476 --> 00:13:12.916 A:middle
and learn how to code in Byte's

00:13:12.916 --> 00:13:13.316 A:middle
world.

00:13:13.656 --> 00:13:15.366 A:middle
It's colorful, it's exciting.

00:13:15.746 --> 00:13:17.076 A:middle
This is where the learner's code

00:13:17.076 --> 00:13:18.456 A:middle
is going to execute, where

00:13:18.456 --> 00:13:19.386 A:middle
they're going to see what

00:13:19.416 --> 00:13:20.376 A:middle
they've created.

00:13:20.616 --> 00:13:22.166 A:middle
This is your point, to get them

00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:23.636 A:middle
interested in whatever it is

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:26.896 A:middle
you're trying to teach them.

00:13:27.116 --> 00:13:28.506 A:middle
In addition to these collection

00:13:28.506 --> 00:13:30.016 A:middle
of pages that make up a Swift

00:13:30.016 --> 00:13:31.616 A:middle
Playground, there are a few

00:13:31.616 --> 00:13:33.176 A:middle
other features that you can add

00:13:33.606 --> 00:13:35.296 A:middle
to make your experiences really

00:13:35.296 --> 00:13:35.766 A:middle
gripping.

00:13:40.226 --> 00:13:42.276 A:middle
There we go.

00:13:42.506 --> 00:13:43.746 A:middle
One of the first ones is

00:13:43.816 --> 00:13:44.486 A:middle
Cutscenes.

00:13:44.896 --> 00:13:45.776 A:middle
If you're familiar with the

00:13:45.776 --> 00:13:47.176 A:middle
Learn to Codes, then you'll

00:13:47.176 --> 00:13:48.206 A:middle
probably have seen some of

00:13:48.206 --> 00:13:48.506 A:middle
these.

00:13:49.246 --> 00:13:50.576 A:middle
We typically add them at the

00:13:50.576 --> 00:13:53.056 A:middle
beginning of new chapters, or

00:13:53.056 --> 00:13:54.936 A:middle
new sections, to introduce a

00:13:54.936 --> 00:13:57.666 A:middle
concept in a fun, animated way.

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:00.956 A:middle
These are written in HTML, and

00:14:00.956 --> 00:14:02.406 A:middle
they're a good way to introduce

00:14:02.406 --> 00:14:04.196 A:middle
a new topic before you dive

00:14:04.256 --> 00:14:05.286 A:middle
straight into the code.

00:14:05.446 --> 00:14:06.286 A:middle
Give the learner a sense of

00:14:06.286 --> 00:14:06.956 A:middle
where it is they're going.

00:14:10.386 --> 00:14:12.496 A:middle
You can also add hints to your

00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:13.116 A:middle
playground books.

00:14:14.236 --> 00:14:16.266 A:middle
These are so important for

00:14:16.266 --> 00:14:18.486 A:middle
giving the learner a contextual

00:14:18.766 --> 00:14:20.316 A:middle
sense of where they're going

00:14:20.316 --> 00:14:20.866 A:middle
wrong.

00:14:21.616 --> 00:14:22.256 A:middle
You can do a bit of

00:14:22.256 --> 00:14:23.576 A:middle
introspecting on the learner's

00:14:23.576 --> 00:14:25.096 A:middle
code in order to figure out

00:14:25.326 --> 00:14:27.036 A:middle
exactly what mistake they might

00:14:27.036 --> 00:14:28.176 A:middle
have made, and offer them

00:14:28.346 --> 00:14:29.126 A:middle
tailored help.

00:14:29.626 --> 00:14:31.216 A:middle
It's incredibly engaging to have

00:14:31.216 --> 00:14:32.916 A:middle
software understand what you

00:14:32.916 --> 00:14:34.656 A:middle
need specifically instead of a

00:14:34.656 --> 00:14:36.396 A:middle
one size fits all sort of

00:14:36.396 --> 00:14:37.086 A:middle
experience.

00:14:38.016 --> 00:14:39.016 A:middle
So, use hints.

00:14:39.806 --> 00:14:41.016 A:middle
One thing to keep in mind with

00:14:41.016 --> 00:14:42.196 A:middle
hints is that some learners

00:14:42.196 --> 00:14:44.476 A:middle
really don't like the extra

00:14:44.626 --> 00:14:45.686 A:middle
help, they want to do it

00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:46.286 A:middle
themselves.

00:14:46.566 --> 00:14:47.876 A:middle
So don't put essential

00:14:47.876 --> 00:14:49.246 A:middle
information to solving the

00:14:49.246 --> 00:14:50.116 A:middle
problem in here.

00:14:50.396 --> 00:14:51.956 A:middle
Make these real hints for those

00:14:51.956 --> 00:14:54.396 A:middle
who need them.

00:14:54.606 --> 00:14:56.586 A:middle
If hints aren't enough, you can

00:14:56.586 --> 00:14:58.276 A:middle
also add solutions to your

00:14:58.276 --> 00:14:59.246 A:middle
playground pages.

00:14:59.996 --> 00:15:01.146 A:middle
These are essential.

00:15:01.556 --> 00:15:02.756 A:middle
Think about the first time you

00:15:02.756 --> 00:15:03.636 A:middle
were trying to learn a new

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:04.386 A:middle
technology.

00:15:05.036 --> 00:15:06.246 A:middle
Could you do it just with

00:15:06.246 --> 00:15:07.936 A:middle
someone explaining conceptually?

00:15:08.196 --> 00:15:09.176 A:middle
Or, did you need to look at a

00:15:09.176 --> 00:15:10.256 A:middle
reference example?

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:12.776 A:middle
These are so helpful for your

00:15:12.776 --> 00:15:14.076 A:middle
learners that get stuck and

00:15:14.076 --> 00:15:15.336 A:middle
aren't sure of the syntax,

00:15:15.406 --> 00:15:16.696 A:middle
aren't sure how to go on.

00:15:17.036 --> 00:15:18.656 A:middle
The solution gives them that

00:15:18.656 --> 00:15:19.576 A:middle
help they need.

00:15:19.826 --> 00:15:20.676 A:middle
Otherwise they might get

00:15:20.676 --> 00:15:21.916 A:middle
frustrated and leave your

00:15:21.916 --> 00:15:23.116 A:middle
playground book entirely.

00:15:23.676 --> 00:15:28.616 A:middle
You can also add assessments at

00:15:28.706 --> 00:15:28.886 A:middle
the end.

00:15:29.816 --> 00:15:31.686 A:middle
These typically pop up once the

00:15:31.686 --> 00:15:33.546 A:middle
learner has completed the task

00:15:33.826 --> 00:15:34.626 A:middle
that you've set them.

00:15:35.546 --> 00:15:37.106 A:middle
You can also customize these

00:15:37.366 --> 00:15:38.926 A:middle
depending on how your learner

00:15:38.926 --> 00:15:39.856 A:middle
has solved the puzzle.

00:15:40.416 --> 00:15:41.986 A:middle
Maybe you wanted them to use for

00:15:41.986 --> 00:15:43.436 A:middle
loops, but they used repeated

00:15:43.436 --> 00:15:44.476 A:middle
code instead.

00:15:44.956 --> 00:15:46.346 A:middle
Now's your chance to suggest to

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:48.246 A:middle
them, great job, you completed

00:15:48.246 --> 00:15:50.426 A:middle
the puzzle, but maybe next time,

00:15:50.426 --> 00:15:51.406 A:middle
use a for loop instead.

00:15:51.996 --> 00:15:53.256 A:middle
It's a little bit better of a

00:15:53.306 --> 00:15:53.796 A:middle
paradigm.

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:58.236 A:middle
Alright. So we're all set,

00:15:58.286 --> 00:15:58.656 A:middle
right?

00:15:59.056 --> 00:16:00.886 A:middle
We know about pages, we know

00:16:00.886 --> 00:16:03.176 A:middle
about assessments and hints,

00:16:03.816 --> 00:16:04.786 A:middle
it's coding time.

00:16:06.206 --> 00:16:08.316 A:middle
Not so. We went ahead to the

00:16:08.316 --> 00:16:09.046 A:middle
drawing board.

00:16:10.066 --> 00:16:10.596 A:middle
Literally.

00:16:11.436 --> 00:16:12.666 A:middle
These are some of my actual

00:16:12.666 --> 00:16:14.366 A:middle
notes in the actual notebook

00:16:14.396 --> 00:16:16.086 A:middle
that I keep when I'm designing

00:16:16.086 --> 00:16:17.026 A:middle
for Swift Playgrounds.

00:16:17.596 --> 00:16:19.676 A:middle
Quick sketches, just getting

00:16:19.676 --> 00:16:21.406 A:middle
thoughts out of my brain onto

00:16:21.406 --> 00:16:21.976 A:middle
the paper.

00:16:22.376 --> 00:16:23.646 A:middle
I might have a thought while I'm

00:16:23.976 --> 00:16:25.646 A:middle
riding the shuttle, or in the

00:16:25.646 --> 00:16:27.046 A:middle
shower, and I just want to get

00:16:27.046 --> 00:16:28.276 A:middle
that down somewhere so that I

00:16:28.276 --> 00:16:29.566 A:middle
can iterate on it later.

00:16:30.446 --> 00:16:32.356 A:middle
Starting out writing code, is a

00:16:32.356 --> 00:16:33.836 A:middle
really expensive way to

00:16:33.836 --> 00:16:34.456 A:middle
prototype.

00:16:34.876 --> 00:16:36.206 A:middle
You might spend weeks getting a

00:16:36.206 --> 00:16:38.176 A:middle
cool working demo ready, and

00:16:38.176 --> 00:16:39.476 A:middle
then show it to a potential

00:16:39.476 --> 00:16:41.266 A:middle
learner, and they are totally

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:43.136 A:middle
lost, or they think it's boring.

00:16:43.526 --> 00:16:44.786 A:middle
Well, now you're stuck and you

00:16:44.786 --> 00:16:46.686 A:middle
have to redo all of those weeks

00:16:46.686 --> 00:16:47.426 A:middle
of coding work.

00:16:48.096 --> 00:16:50.586 A:middle
Instead, start with cheap

00:16:50.806 --> 00:16:51.566 A:middle
prototyping.

00:16:52.046 --> 00:16:53.796 A:middle
It's just as easy to show a set

00:16:53.796 --> 00:16:55.836 A:middle
of storyboards on a whiteboard,

00:16:55.836 --> 00:16:58.266 A:middle
or in a KeyNote even, to some

00:16:58.266 --> 00:16:59.576 A:middle
potential learners, to some of

00:16:59.576 --> 00:17:01.296 A:middle
your colleagues to get feedback

00:17:01.296 --> 00:17:02.576 A:middle
in that initial stage.

00:17:06.416 --> 00:17:07.916 A:middle
So we're all set now.

00:17:08.106 --> 00:17:10.116 A:middle
We've got the main parts of the

00:17:10.116 --> 00:17:11.996 A:middle
playground book in mind, we

00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:13.106 A:middle
understand we want to start out

00:17:13.106 --> 00:17:15.596 A:middle
with cheap, fast prototyping, so

00:17:15.596 --> 00:17:17.336 A:middle
now let's take those ideals that

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:19.236 A:middle
Bill taught us about, and put

00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:21.266 A:middle
them into practice.

00:17:21.266 --> 00:17:23.036 A:middle
What is the learner's goal?

00:17:23.116 --> 00:17:25.126 A:middle
I want to take a minute here to

00:17:25.126 --> 00:17:27.016 A:middle
help you separate in your minds

00:17:27.326 --> 00:17:28.506 A:middle
the actual different goals that

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:29.236 A:middle
are going on.

00:17:29.946 --> 00:17:31.746 A:middle
There's your goal as the author.

00:17:32.016 --> 00:17:33.146 A:middle
What do you want your learner to

00:17:33.146 --> 00:17:35.496 A:middle
get out of the whole playground,

00:17:35.936 --> 00:17:38.026 A:middle
and of each individual page?

00:17:38.676 --> 00:17:39.736 A:middle
Those are separate goals.

00:17:40.666 --> 00:17:42.346 A:middle
Your learner, as well, has a

00:17:42.346 --> 00:17:44.966 A:middle
goal on a per-page basis, and

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.496 A:middle
throughout the whole playground

00:17:46.496 --> 00:17:46.786 A:middle
book.

00:17:47.526 --> 00:17:49.046 A:middle
For example, in Cipher, a

00:17:49.046 --> 00:17:50.536 A:middle
cryptography-focused playground,

00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:52.046 A:middle
we released recently, the

00:17:52.046 --> 00:17:53.776 A:middle
learner's goal is to solve the

00:17:53.776 --> 00:17:55.326 A:middle
mystery over the course of the

00:17:55.326 --> 00:17:55.916 A:middle
pages.

00:17:55.916 --> 00:17:57.256 A:middle
They find this encrypted note

00:17:57.496 --> 00:17:58.506 A:middle
and want to figure out what it

00:17:58.506 --> 00:17:58.906 A:middle
means.

00:17:59.736 --> 00:18:01.746 A:middle
My goal as the author is to get

00:18:01.746 --> 00:18:03.476 A:middle
them interested in cryptography

00:18:03.476 --> 00:18:05.046 A:middle
and give them a few new words,

00:18:05.156 --> 00:18:07.086 A:middle
plain text, ciphertext, just to

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.526 A:middle
spark that interest in a

00:18:08.526 --> 00:18:09.526 A:middle
potential discipline.

00:18:10.496 --> 00:18:12.686 A:middle
So, keep those goals in mind and

00:18:12.686 --> 00:18:14.036 A:middle
figure out how you can make them

00:18:14.256 --> 00:18:16.156 A:middle
intermarry in the best way, to

00:18:16.156 --> 00:18:17.496 A:middle
fully support your learner in

00:18:17.496 --> 00:18:18.226 A:middle
their experience.

00:18:18.746 --> 00:18:22.386 A:middle
So now, let's walk through some

00:18:22.386 --> 00:18:23.856 A:middle
potential goals that you might

00:18:23.856 --> 00:18:25.516 A:middle
have, and that we often use in

00:18:25.516 --> 00:18:29.316 A:middle
Swift Playgrounds on each page.

00:18:29.546 --> 00:18:30.196 A:middle
Completing a task.

00:18:31.126 --> 00:18:32.316 A:middle
This one's probably the most

00:18:32.316 --> 00:18:33.846 A:middle
familiar to a lot of you.

00:18:34.086 --> 00:18:35.336 A:middle
We use this a lot in the Learn

00:18:35.336 --> 00:18:35.836 A:middle
to Codes.

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:38.416 A:middle
Collect all the gems, flip two

00:18:38.416 --> 00:18:40.626 A:middle
switches, and collect one gem,

00:18:40.856 --> 00:18:42.086 A:middle
place the expert in the right

00:18:42.086 --> 00:18:42.416 A:middle
area.

00:18:43.166 --> 00:18:44.506 A:middle
These are easy for the learner

00:18:44.506 --> 00:18:45.876 A:middle
to understand what you want them

00:18:45.876 --> 00:18:46.496 A:middle
to do.

00:18:46.726 --> 00:18:47.776 A:middle
They have a clear starting

00:18:47.776 --> 00:18:49.826 A:middle
point, a clear ending point, and

00:18:49.986 --> 00:18:51.036 A:middle
these are easy for you to

00:18:51.036 --> 00:18:52.526 A:middle
assess, and offer that

00:18:52.566 --> 00:18:53.506 A:middle
personalized-- those

00:18:53.506 --> 00:18:55.046 A:middle
personalized hints and

00:18:55.196 --> 00:18:58.096 A:middle
assessments at the end.

00:18:58.096 --> 00:18:58.706 A:middle
Experiment.

00:18:59.506 --> 00:19:00.936 A:middle
I love these kind of pages,

00:19:00.936 --> 00:19:02.486 A:middle
because I like to play around

00:19:02.486 --> 00:19:03.496 A:middle
with the code I'm given.

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:05.596 A:middle
These are a really good way to

00:19:05.596 --> 00:19:07.316 A:middle
introduce learners to something

00:19:07.316 --> 00:19:09.506 A:middle
complex, to give them a sense of

00:19:09.506 --> 00:19:11.416 A:middle
where they're going before they

00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:12.696 A:middle
dive in to the code.

00:19:13.776 --> 00:19:15.566 A:middle
We often use this by showing a

00:19:15.566 --> 00:19:17.886 A:middle
whole big block of code, maybe

00:19:17.886 --> 00:19:19.406 A:middle
new functions the learner hasn't

00:19:19.406 --> 00:19:21.566 A:middle
seen yet, maybe new variables,

00:19:21.566 --> 00:19:23.446 A:middle
even new concepts, and then we

00:19:23.446 --> 00:19:24.796 A:middle
minimize the amount of code

00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:26.216 A:middle
that's actually editable to

00:19:26.216 --> 00:19:27.866 A:middle
them, so they're not overwhelmed

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:29.596 A:middle
by seeing, whoa, this is a lot

00:19:29.596 --> 00:19:30.376 A:middle
of new stuff.

00:19:30.766 --> 00:19:32.566 A:middle
Instead, they can pick out the

00:19:32.566 --> 00:19:33.186 A:middle
parts.

00:19:33.186 --> 00:19:34.696 A:middle
"I know how to change a color, I

00:19:34.696 --> 00:19:36.366 A:middle
know how to change a radius to

00:19:36.366 --> 00:19:36.646 A:middle
negative."

00:19:36.646 --> 00:19:38.746 A:middle
And, they can experiment, and

00:19:38.926 --> 00:19:40.306 A:middle
have fun with this thing that

00:19:40.306 --> 00:19:41.556 A:middle
they're about to dive more

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:42.436 A:middle
deeply into.

00:19:44.376 --> 00:19:45.926 A:middle
Practicing a new skill.

00:19:46.036 --> 00:19:48.816 A:middle
I'm hoping you all practice a

00:19:48.816 --> 00:19:49.846 A:middle
new skill right now.

00:19:50.506 --> 00:19:52.586 A:middle
Bill taught us about goal,

00:19:52.586 --> 00:19:54.996 A:middle
audience, and passion, and I'm

00:19:54.996 --> 00:19:56.236 A:middle
reiterating that to you now.

00:19:56.426 --> 00:19:57.386 A:middle
So, that hopefully when you

00:19:57.386 --> 00:19:59.186 A:middle
leave this room, you have those

00:19:59.226 --> 00:20:00.716 A:middle
three concepts in your mind.

00:20:02.396 --> 00:20:04.656 A:middle
Learners won't grok a concept

00:20:04.756 --> 00:20:06.286 A:middle
immediately, the first time.

00:20:06.636 --> 00:20:07.986 A:middle
You might wish they would, but

00:20:07.986 --> 00:20:09.256 A:middle
I'm sure through experience;

00:20:09.316 --> 00:20:10.496 A:middle
think back to when you first

00:20:10.496 --> 00:20:11.566 A:middle
learned a new, complicated

00:20:11.566 --> 00:20:11.936 A:middle
thing.

00:20:12.346 --> 00:20:13.286 A:middle
Could you have written a

00:20:13.286 --> 00:20:14.886 A:middle
definition, explained it to one

00:20:14.886 --> 00:20:16.266 A:middle
of your colleagues immediately?

00:20:16.726 --> 00:20:18.466 A:middle
No, you needed to practice that

00:20:18.466 --> 00:20:20.066 A:middle
skill, to use it in different

00:20:20.066 --> 00:20:22.146 A:middle
contexts so that you can then go

00:20:22.376 --> 00:20:23.896 A:middle
and apply that to some new

00:20:23.896 --> 00:20:24.336 A:middle
place.

00:20:25.456 --> 00:20:26.736 A:middle
So, really important to include

00:20:26.736 --> 00:20:28.226 A:middle
these types of pages in your

00:20:28.226 --> 00:20:29.446 A:middle
playground book.

00:20:30.916 --> 00:20:32.606 A:middle
Think about a concept.

00:20:33.896 --> 00:20:35.236 A:middle
This one is sort of different.

00:20:35.956 --> 00:20:37.636 A:middle
We talk a lot about code and the

00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:39.566 A:middle
learner code on each page, but

00:20:39.566 --> 00:20:41.176 A:middle
often in the Learn to Codes and

00:20:41.176 --> 00:20:42.486 A:middle
the challenges in all of your

00:20:42.536 --> 00:20:43.646 A:middle
playground books, you're

00:20:43.646 --> 00:20:45.386 A:middle
introducing something totally

00:20:45.616 --> 00:20:46.106 A:middle
new.

00:20:46.516 --> 00:20:48.016 A:middle
In the cryptography playground,

00:20:48.016 --> 00:20:49.526 A:middle
I'm introducing all of

00:20:49.526 --> 00:20:50.646 A:middle
cryptography, and there's

00:20:50.696 --> 00:20:52.036 A:middle
complicated words like

00:20:52.086 --> 00:20:54.216 A:middle
ciphertext and key and message.

00:20:54.616 --> 00:20:56.276 A:middle
That's a lot of new information

00:20:56.276 --> 00:20:57.636 A:middle
for a learner to take in.

00:20:58.266 --> 00:20:59.256 A:middle
And, you want to make sure you

00:20:59.256 --> 00:21:00.406 A:middle
give them that space.

00:21:00.886 --> 00:21:04.956 A:middle
To read, understand, and reflect

00:21:05.436 --> 00:21:06.526 A:middle
on what you're telling them.

00:21:07.356 --> 00:21:08.866 A:middle
We have several pages that don't

00:21:08.866 --> 00:21:10.606 A:middle
have any user coding on a page,

00:21:11.026 --> 00:21:12.276 A:middle
because those pages are

00:21:12.406 --> 00:21:13.316 A:middle
concept-heavy.

00:21:13.696 --> 00:21:14.896 A:middle
And, we want to give the learner

00:21:15.976 --> 00:21:18.256 A:middle
that space.

00:21:18.456 --> 00:21:19.806 A:middle
Finally, create.

00:21:20.336 --> 00:21:21.686 A:middle
These pages are awesome.

00:21:22.206 --> 00:21:23.226 A:middle
This is where you really get to

00:21:23.226 --> 00:21:24.826 A:middle
show your skills, show what

00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:25.516 A:middle
you've learned.

00:21:26.296 --> 00:21:28.126 A:middle
We've given you, the author, all

00:21:28.126 --> 00:21:30.426 A:middle
the tools you need, and now the

00:21:30.426 --> 00:21:32.456 A:middle
learner is able to go nuts.

00:21:33.246 --> 00:21:34.526 A:middle
They know how to change colors,

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:36.296 A:middle
they know how to add functions,

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:37.846 A:middle
they can make the robot dance,

00:21:37.846 --> 00:21:38.876 A:middle
but they couldn't before.

00:21:39.416 --> 00:21:40.566 A:middle
This is their chance to really

00:21:40.566 --> 00:21:42.656 A:middle
explore, and to feel empowered.

00:21:42.656 --> 00:21:44.126 A:middle
This is why they came to coding.

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:45.926 A:middle
Why did you all come to coding?

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:47.366 A:middle
Probably to do something.

00:21:47.366 --> 00:21:48.176 A:middle
To learn something.

00:21:48.176 --> 00:21:49.326 A:middle
To create something.

00:21:49.806 --> 00:21:51.176 A:middle
Keep that in mind, that that's

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:52.396 A:middle
likely what's in your learners'

00:21:52.396 --> 00:21:53.166 A:middle
minds too.

00:21:53.306 --> 00:21:54.146 A:middle
That they want to create

00:21:54.216 --> 00:21:54.696 A:middle
something.

00:21:55.106 --> 00:21:56.006 A:middle
And so, give them that

00:21:56.006 --> 00:21:56.716 A:middle
opportunity.

00:21:57.446 --> 00:21:59.346 A:middle
Include a wide variety of these

00:21:59.456 --> 00:22:00.676 A:middle
types of pages in your

00:22:00.676 --> 00:22:02.126 A:middle
playgrounds, and you'll keep

00:22:02.126 --> 00:22:03.356 A:middle
your learners engaged,

00:22:03.536 --> 00:22:04.936 A:middle
interested, and excited for

00:22:04.936 --> 00:22:06.346 A:middle
what's coming next.

00:22:08.116 --> 00:22:09.746 A:middle
So, how do we do all of this?

00:22:09.936 --> 00:22:12.226 A:middle
How do we get the learner to

00:22:12.226 --> 00:22:12.936 A:middle
these places?

00:22:12.936 --> 00:22:14.276 A:middle
How to create these pages?

00:22:15.156 --> 00:22:17.296 A:middle
Well, in Swift Playgrounds

00:22:17.296 --> 00:22:19.086 A:middle
itself, you have several prose

00:22:19.116 --> 00:22:22.386 A:middle
tools available to you.

00:22:22.596 --> 00:22:24.706 A:middle
Number one is glossary entries.

00:22:25.956 --> 00:22:27.446 A:middle
These are incredibly important

00:22:27.566 --> 00:22:29.006 A:middle
especially when thinking about

00:22:29.006 --> 00:22:30.196 A:middle
your audience.

00:22:30.466 --> 00:22:31.456 A:middle
Another one of those big,

00:22:31.456 --> 00:22:32.146 A:middle
important points.

00:22:33.206 --> 00:22:35.426 A:middle
Algorithm might be a simple word

00:22:35.516 --> 00:22:37.266 A:middle
for all of you, many of you.

00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:38.706 A:middle
You're coders, you're

00:22:38.706 --> 00:22:40.416 A:middle
programmers, you've been around

00:22:40.416 --> 00:22:42.586 A:middle
the block, and you know what an

00:22:42.586 --> 00:22:43.306 A:middle
algorithm is.

00:22:44.076 --> 00:22:45.706 A:middle
But, a beginner, who's brand new

00:22:45.706 --> 00:22:47.256 A:middle
to coding, that's a difficult

00:22:47.256 --> 00:22:47.626 A:middle
word.

00:22:48.076 --> 00:22:49.626 A:middle
Something they can't just intuit

00:22:49.626 --> 00:22:50.646 A:middle
from reading the rest of your

00:22:50.646 --> 00:22:51.156 A:middle
prose.

00:22:51.576 --> 00:22:53.016 A:middle
And so, offering this glossary

00:22:53.016 --> 00:22:54.686 A:middle
entry, which is triggered in

00:22:54.686 --> 00:22:55.866 A:middle
Swift Playgrounds just by

00:22:55.866 --> 00:22:57.026 A:middle
tapping on that differently

00:22:57.026 --> 00:22:58.756 A:middle
colored word, gives them the

00:22:58.756 --> 00:23:00.806 A:middle
support they need to keep on

00:23:00.806 --> 00:23:01.996 A:middle
with your playground book.

00:23:02.836 --> 00:23:04.486 A:middle
Keep in mind, you, as the

00:23:04.486 --> 00:23:05.966 A:middle
author, are not going to be

00:23:05.966 --> 00:23:07.386 A:middle
there to pop out of the page,

00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:08.956 A:middle
and tell your learner something

00:23:08.956 --> 00:23:09.886 A:middle
when they're having trouble.

00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:11.996 A:middle
You need to communicate solely

00:23:11.996 --> 00:23:13.156 A:middle
via the medium of text.

00:23:13.916 --> 00:23:15.136 A:middle
And so, you want to use all the

00:23:15.136 --> 00:23:16.806 A:middle
tools at your disposal to give

00:23:16.806 --> 00:23:18.206 A:middle
extra help where it's needed,

00:23:18.686 --> 00:23:20.536 A:middle
and support your learner in

00:23:20.536 --> 00:23:21.046 A:middle
their process.

00:23:21.986 --> 00:23:23.816 A:middle
A great way to figure out what

00:23:23.816 --> 00:23:25.436 A:middle
kinds of glossary entries you're

00:23:25.436 --> 00:23:27.196 A:middle
going to need is by user

00:23:27.196 --> 00:23:27.786 A:middle
testing.

00:23:28.306 --> 00:23:29.776 A:middle
Put this in the prototyping

00:23:29.776 --> 00:23:31.186 A:middle
stage when you get some prose

00:23:31.186 --> 00:23:32.406 A:middle
written down in front of

00:23:32.406 --> 00:23:34.526 A:middle
learners, and listen to them.

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:35.566 A:middle
What words don't they

00:23:35.566 --> 00:23:36.236 A:middle
understand?

00:23:36.546 --> 00:23:37.846 A:middle
What concept did they clearly

00:23:37.846 --> 00:23:39.136 A:middle
not get because they skipped

00:23:39.136 --> 00:23:40.366 A:middle
over a vocab word?

00:23:40.576 --> 00:23:41.706 A:middle
And, include these in your

00:23:41.706 --> 00:23:42.556 A:middle
glossary entries.

00:23:43.956 --> 00:23:46.436 A:middle
It's also worth noting, that, if

00:23:46.436 --> 00:23:47.296 A:middle
you're localizing your

00:23:47.296 --> 00:23:48.756 A:middle
playground, you can add

00:23:48.756 --> 00:23:50.346 A:middle
additional glossary entries in

00:23:50.346 --> 00:23:51.916 A:middle
different localized languages.

00:23:52.336 --> 00:23:53.466 A:middle
So, that if there's something

00:23:53.686 --> 00:23:55.226 A:middle
jargon-y that maybe an English

00:23:55.226 --> 00:23:56.676 A:middle
speaker would understand, you

00:23:56.676 --> 00:23:58.336 A:middle
can offer a glossary entry to

00:23:58.396 --> 00:24:00.066 A:middle
that in another language.

00:24:00.586 --> 00:24:02.356 A:middle
So, keep that in mind.

00:24:03.946 --> 00:24:07.276 A:middle
Take a minute to read this

00:24:07.316 --> 00:24:07.976 A:middle
definition.

00:24:14.546 --> 00:24:15.946 A:middle
You all feel confident about

00:24:15.946 --> 00:24:17.016 A:middle
substitution ciphers?

00:24:17.406 --> 00:24:18.416 A:middle
You could send me a message

00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:20.126 A:middle
right now in substitution cipher

00:24:20.126 --> 00:24:21.076 A:middle
with a shift of 3?

00:24:21.616 --> 00:24:24.326 A:middle
What about if I also gave you

00:24:24.326 --> 00:24:25.246 A:middle
this diagram?

00:24:26.496 --> 00:24:28.026 A:middle
This is much more valuable.

00:24:28.866 --> 00:24:30.116 A:middle
It's helpful to have both,

00:24:30.226 --> 00:24:30.916 A:middle
definitely.

00:24:31.106 --> 00:24:32.416 A:middle
The diagram on its own wouldn't

00:24:32.416 --> 00:24:34.306 A:middle
do it, but just the prose

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:36.406 A:middle
without this visual, impactful

00:24:36.616 --> 00:24:37.116 A:middle
picture?

00:24:37.756 --> 00:24:38.986 A:middle
Is not going to cut it either.

00:24:40.196 --> 00:24:42.506 A:middle
It's so helpful to have visual

00:24:42.536 --> 00:24:44.146 A:middle
aids in explaining difficult

00:24:44.146 --> 00:24:44.856 A:middle
concepts.

00:24:45.446 --> 00:24:48.176 A:middle
Do keep in mind, that if you add

00:24:48.176 --> 00:24:49.776 A:middle
visual aids, which you can add

00:24:49.776 --> 00:24:51.656 A:middle
in that prose section, right in

00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:53.056 A:middle
the prose, that you want to make

00:24:53.056 --> 00:24:54.446 A:middle
sure they have accessibility

00:24:54.446 --> 00:24:56.526 A:middle
labels, so that your users using

00:24:56.526 --> 00:24:58.216 A:middle
VoiceOver have just as rich of

00:24:58.216 --> 00:25:00.046 A:middle
an experience as those who are

00:25:00.046 --> 00:25:00.976 A:middle
not using VoiceOver.

00:25:05.196 --> 00:25:06.576 A:middle
Here's a wall of text.

00:25:07.516 --> 00:25:08.736 A:middle
Lots of stuff going on here.

00:25:09.796 --> 00:25:11.516 A:middle
Luckily, there's a callout.

00:25:12.386 --> 00:25:13.726 A:middle
I know which part of this I need

00:25:13.726 --> 00:25:14.596 A:middle
to pay attention to.

00:25:14.906 --> 00:25:16.286 A:middle
Right here, new awesome

00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:16.846 A:middle
function.

00:25:17.176 --> 00:25:17.946 A:middle
I'm ready to go.

00:25:18.916 --> 00:25:20.316 A:middle
In a lot of our user testing,

00:25:21.236 --> 00:25:23.196 A:middle
users, no matter what age group,

00:25:23.426 --> 00:25:25.336 A:middle
what experience level, often

00:25:25.336 --> 00:25:26.436 A:middle
skim the prose.

00:25:26.786 --> 00:25:27.866 A:middle
They want to get right into

00:25:27.866 --> 00:25:29.766 A:middle
coding, they don't care about

00:25:29.766 --> 00:25:31.206 A:middle
all the awesome instructions

00:25:31.206 --> 00:25:32.646 A:middle
you've given, you've slaved over

00:25:32.646 --> 00:25:33.146 A:middle
for weeks.

00:25:33.696 --> 00:25:34.986 A:middle
They just want to get in there

00:25:34.986 --> 00:25:36.086 A:middle
and write some code.

00:25:36.086 --> 00:25:37.216 A:middle
And so, support that.

00:25:37.656 --> 00:25:39.986 A:middle
Give people their tl;dr, too

00:25:39.986 --> 00:25:41.396 A:middle
long; didn't read it version, in

00:25:41.396 --> 00:25:43.006 A:middle
the middle so they can get right

00:25:43.006 --> 00:25:43.386 A:middle
in there.

00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:46.416 A:middle
Still, offer them that prose

00:25:46.466 --> 00:25:47.636 A:middle
support, around it.

00:25:48.096 --> 00:25:49.466 A:middle
If your learner does dive right

00:25:49.546 --> 00:25:50.646 A:middle
in, tries out new awesome

00:25:50.646 --> 00:25:52.096 A:middle
function, and it doesn't do what

00:25:52.096 --> 00:25:54.036 A:middle
they expected, they need to be

00:25:54.036 --> 00:25:56.076 A:middle
able to come back and read about

00:25:56.076 --> 00:25:57.696 A:middle
it, and find out what it does.

00:25:58.836 --> 00:26:00.016 A:middle
It's all about supporting your

00:26:00.016 --> 00:26:01.616 A:middle
learner in every aspect you

00:26:01.616 --> 00:26:02.926 A:middle
think they might need support.

00:26:06.656 --> 00:26:09.066 A:middle
Finally, the shortcut bar.

00:26:10.276 --> 00:26:11.996 A:middle
This might not seem like a prose

00:26:11.996 --> 00:26:14.246 A:middle
tool, but it's incredibly

00:26:14.246 --> 00:26:14.866 A:middle
important.

00:26:15.156 --> 00:26:16.716 A:middle
And you, as the authors, have

00:26:16.716 --> 00:26:18.456 A:middle
control over what appears in

00:26:18.456 --> 00:26:19.396 A:middle
this shortcut bar.

00:26:20.146 --> 00:26:21.336 A:middle
This is how your learner is

00:26:21.336 --> 00:26:22.486 A:middle
going to start coding.

00:26:22.746 --> 00:26:23.796 A:middle
This is how they're doing it on

00:26:23.796 --> 00:26:24.476 A:middle
an iPad.

00:26:24.736 --> 00:26:26.696 A:middle
Tapping functions, tapping

00:26:26.876 --> 00:26:27.706 A:middle
keywords.

00:26:28.096 --> 00:26:30.096 A:middle
This is their main toolbox.

00:26:30.836 --> 00:26:34.216 A:middle
So, make it easy to use.

00:26:34.366 --> 00:26:36.866 A:middle
Only include relevant choices.

00:26:37.546 --> 00:26:39.166 A:middle
If your learner's on page tw0 of

00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:40.616 A:middle
your playground book, and you

00:26:40.616 --> 00:26:42.686 A:middle
have functions from page six and

00:26:42.686 --> 00:26:44.166 A:middle
seven in that shortcut bar,

00:26:44.816 --> 00:26:46.116 A:middle
that's going to be exhausting

00:26:46.116 --> 00:26:46.696 A:middle
and distracting.

00:26:46.696 --> 00:26:47.956 A:middle
They're going to have to scroll

00:26:47.956 --> 00:26:49.826 A:middle
through, finally get to the

00:26:49.826 --> 00:26:50.936 A:middle
functions they wanted for this

00:26:50.936 --> 00:26:52.476 A:middle
page, and wonder why they had

00:26:52.476 --> 00:26:53.606 A:middle
all these extra functions in the

00:26:53.606 --> 00:26:53.936 A:middle
middle.

00:26:54.686 --> 00:26:55.946 A:middle
It might even be confusing.

00:26:56.526 --> 00:26:57.596 A:middle
Maybe they thought they needed

00:26:57.596 --> 00:26:58.806 A:middle
to use those other functions.

00:26:59.156 --> 00:27:00.186 A:middle
But, they don't, and now they're

00:27:00.186 --> 00:27:00.866 A:middle
not sure.

00:27:00.916 --> 00:27:01.726 A:middle
And, you haven't gotten your

00:27:01.726 --> 00:27:03.176 A:middle
point across as well as you

00:27:04.066 --> 00:27:06.566 A:middle
might have.

00:27:06.766 --> 00:27:08.676 A:middle
Use concise method names.

00:27:09.756 --> 00:27:11.166 A:middle
This one can be a little tough,

00:27:11.456 --> 00:27:13.136 A:middle
because sometimes the method's

00:27:13.136 --> 00:27:14.386 A:middle
got to say what it's got to say,

00:27:14.936 --> 00:27:15.686 A:middle
but do your best.

00:27:16.676 --> 00:27:18.786 A:middle
The one I have here, "shift word

00:27:18.786 --> 00:27:21.306 A:middle
by," easy, fits on the screen,

00:27:21.866 --> 00:27:22.886 A:middle
and it's easy for the learner to

00:27:22.886 --> 00:27:23.636 A:middle
understand.

00:27:24.366 --> 00:27:25.706 A:middle
Important to keep your audience

00:27:25.706 --> 00:27:27.006 A:middle
in mind here too, in terms of

00:27:27.226 --> 00:27:28.806 A:middle
what kind of vocabulary you're

00:27:28.806 --> 00:27:30.296 A:middle
using in these method names.

00:27:30.636 --> 00:27:31.926 A:middle
Your word choice is just as

00:27:31.926 --> 00:27:33.446 A:middle
important as the concepts you're

00:27:33.446 --> 00:27:36.576 A:middle
leading them through.

00:27:36.796 --> 00:27:39.256 A:middle
And, finally, please provide

00:27:39.256 --> 00:27:40.446 A:middle
common keywords.

00:27:41.226 --> 00:27:42.836 A:middle
We all love autocomplete.

00:27:43.566 --> 00:27:44.706 A:middle
Your learner will love it if

00:27:44.706 --> 00:27:46.486 A:middle
they can just tap "func", tap

00:27:46.736 --> 00:27:48.286 A:middle
"var", tap "if" to put it in

00:27:48.316 --> 00:27:48.456 A:middle
there.

00:27:49.136 --> 00:27:50.716 A:middle
Don't make them type those over

00:27:50.716 --> 00:27:51.226 A:middle
and over.

00:27:51.616 --> 00:27:52.496 A:middle
You want to focus on the

00:27:52.496 --> 00:27:53.666 A:middle
learning, and one of the most

00:27:53.666 --> 00:27:55.346 A:middle
important things about focusing

00:27:55.346 --> 00:27:57.326 A:middle
on the learning is not having

00:27:57.356 --> 00:27:59.876 A:middle
ancillary busyness going on in

00:27:59.876 --> 00:28:01.586 A:middle
your mind of remembering, was it

00:28:01.586 --> 00:28:03.366 A:middle
"func" with a capital F, does

00:28:03.366 --> 00:28:04.816 A:middle
the "var"-- do I need a space

00:28:04.816 --> 00:28:06.336 A:middle
before and after the equals?

00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:07.516 A:middle
Things like that.

00:28:07.606 --> 00:28:08.766 A:middle
You don't want to have to deal

00:28:08.766 --> 00:28:09.616 A:middle
with that, and your learner

00:28:09.616 --> 00:28:10.156 A:middle
doesn't either.

00:28:10.796 --> 00:28:12.766 A:middle
So, just provide these helpful

00:28:12.836 --> 00:28:14.766 A:middle
things in the shortcut bar, and

00:28:14.766 --> 00:28:15.746 A:middle
your learner will be able to

00:28:15.746 --> 00:28:17.246 A:middle
focus on what you really want to

00:28:17.246 --> 00:28:18.386 A:middle
teach them, and that's what

00:28:18.386 --> 00:28:18.766 A:middle
matters.

00:28:19.296 --> 00:28:21.476 A:middle
So, we've talked about the

00:28:21.476 --> 00:28:22.426 A:middle
learner, a lot.

00:28:22.506 --> 00:28:25.156 A:middle
And, that brings us to the

00:28:25.156 --> 00:28:26.806 A:middle
second overarching point.

00:28:27.256 --> 00:28:28.456 A:middle
Who is your learner?

00:28:29.146 --> 00:28:30.106 A:middle
Are they a beginner?

00:28:30.686 --> 00:28:31.616 A:middle
Are they advanced?

00:28:32.396 --> 00:28:33.756 A:middle
Are you writing a computational

00:28:33.756 --> 00:28:35.566 A:middle
biology playground, and showing

00:28:35.566 --> 00:28:36.436 A:middle
it to biologists?

00:28:36.926 --> 00:28:37.896 A:middle
Or, showing it to computer

00:28:37.896 --> 00:28:38.556 A:middle
scientists?

00:28:39.286 --> 00:28:40.566 A:middle
Those people are going to bring

00:28:40.616 --> 00:28:42.146 A:middle
totally different backgrounds

00:28:42.146 --> 00:28:43.276 A:middle
and experience levels.

00:28:43.576 --> 00:28:44.666 A:middle
And, you really need to get to

00:28:44.666 --> 00:28:46.496 A:middle
know your learner and understand

00:28:46.496 --> 00:28:47.856 A:middle
where they're coming from to

00:28:47.856 --> 00:28:49.746 A:middle
provide them the best, richest,

00:28:50.016 --> 00:28:51.056 A:middle
most supportive learning

00:28:51.056 --> 00:28:51.666 A:middle
experience.

00:28:52.356 --> 00:28:54.386 A:middle
I'm going to walk you through

00:28:54.386 --> 00:28:56.596 A:middle
some examples now, of pages from

00:28:56.596 --> 00:28:58.376 A:middle
our playground books where we

00:28:58.376 --> 00:29:00.296 A:middle
had goals in mind, but we also

00:29:00.296 --> 00:29:01.506 A:middle
had to keep our audience

00:29:01.576 --> 00:29:02.966 A:middle
strongly in the forefront.

00:29:05.876 --> 00:29:07.626 A:middle
This is a page from Learn to

00:29:07.626 --> 00:29:09.716 A:middle
Code 3, where we're asking the

00:29:09.716 --> 00:29:11.236 A:middle
learner to add a background

00:29:11.236 --> 00:29:12.356 A:middle
image to the screen.

00:29:12.916 --> 00:29:14.996 A:middle
We say it right there.

00:29:15.726 --> 00:29:17.006 A:middle
Set a background image.

00:29:17.006 --> 00:29:17.876 A:middle
Add it to the screen.

00:29:17.876 --> 00:29:19.946 A:middle
And, that's because this is

00:29:19.946 --> 00:29:21.146 A:middle
targeted at a beginner.

00:29:21.806 --> 00:29:23.846 A:middle
Complete a task-style goal, like

00:29:23.846 --> 00:29:25.396 A:middle
we talked about from before, and

00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:26.386 A:middle
beginner audience.

00:29:27.406 --> 00:29:29.336 A:middle
Set a background image, alright,

00:29:30.296 --> 00:29:31.156 A:middle
I'm primed.

00:29:31.266 --> 00:29:33.346 A:middle
And now, right here, this is how

00:29:33.346 --> 00:29:33.816 A:middle
you do it.

00:29:34.086 --> 00:29:36.346 A:middle
scene.backgroundImage equals

00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:37.216 A:middle
"image literal."

00:29:37.606 --> 00:29:39.216 A:middle
I give the learner the syntax,

00:29:39.686 --> 00:29:40.946 A:middle
because, again, this is targeted

00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:42.606 A:middle
at a beginner who's not going to

00:29:42.606 --> 00:29:44.196 A:middle
have all that far-reaching

00:29:44.196 --> 00:29:45.966 A:middle
computer science knowledge, not

00:29:45.966 --> 00:29:47.106 A:middle
even that far-reaching.

00:29:47.106 --> 00:29:48.326 A:middle
To us, this seems simple.

00:29:48.366 --> 00:29:49.236 A:middle
Everyone knows that

00:29:49.236 --> 00:29:50.696 A:middle
"backgroundImage" is the name of

00:29:50.696 --> 00:29:51.366 A:middle
that property.

00:29:51.826 --> 00:29:52.726 A:middle
But a beginner doesn't.

00:29:53.326 --> 00:29:54.526 A:middle
And since we're all content

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:56.526 A:middle
matter experts, it's really hard

00:29:56.526 --> 00:29:58.296 A:middle
to put ourselves in the shoes of

00:29:58.296 --> 00:29:59.946 A:middle
a beginner who isn't familiar

00:29:59.946 --> 00:30:00.606 A:middle
with the syntax.

00:30:01.476 --> 00:30:02.996 A:middle
That's why user testing is so

00:30:02.996 --> 00:30:03.616 A:middle
important.

00:30:03.756 --> 00:30:04.796 A:middle
To figure out what kind of

00:30:04.796 --> 00:30:06.486 A:middle
logical leaps you're making,

00:30:06.816 --> 00:30:08.036 A:middle
that your learner needs to be

00:30:08.036 --> 00:30:09.416 A:middle
walked through a little more

00:30:09.416 --> 00:30:09.946 A:middle
slowly.

00:30:10.516 --> 00:30:13.276 A:middle
We then give them extremely

00:30:13.276 --> 00:30:14.526 A:middle
explicit instructions.

00:30:15.106 --> 00:30:17.186 A:middle
Write the syntax we just gave

00:30:17.186 --> 00:30:19.206 A:middle
you, and then choose "image

00:30:19.206 --> 00:30:20.526 A:middle
literal" from the shortcut bar.

00:30:20.836 --> 00:30:21.966 A:middle
Again, we're offering them the

00:30:21.966 --> 00:30:23.176 A:middle
appropriate shortcuts in the

00:30:23.176 --> 00:30:24.666 A:middle
bar, and then choose a

00:30:24.666 --> 00:30:25.416 A:middle
background image.

00:30:26.046 --> 00:30:27.536 A:middle
By now, you are probably all,

00:30:27.536 --> 00:30:29.316 A:middle
like, I know, background image,

00:30:29.506 --> 00:30:30.566 A:middle
I'm good, move on.

00:30:30.936 --> 00:30:32.166 A:middle
But, a beginner needs this

00:30:32.216 --> 00:30:32.626 A:middle
support.

00:30:34.046 --> 00:30:35.096 A:middle
Finally, we even offer a

00:30:35.096 --> 00:30:35.466 A:middle
comment.

00:30:35.766 --> 00:30:37.126 A:middle
This is where you do it, this is

00:30:37.126 --> 00:30:38.216 A:middle
where you write the code.

00:30:38.506 --> 00:30:39.716 A:middle
Set background image.

00:30:42.496 --> 00:30:44.656 A:middle
Let's take a look at a page with

00:30:44.656 --> 00:30:46.376 A:middle
a similar goal, completing a

00:30:46.376 --> 00:30:48.296 A:middle
task, but with a totally

00:30:48.296 --> 00:30:49.636 A:middle
different audience in mind.

00:30:51.026 --> 00:30:52.676 A:middle
These are your advanced

00:30:52.786 --> 00:30:53.266 A:middle
learners.

00:30:54.696 --> 00:30:56.286 A:middle
We still have a goal statement,

00:30:56.786 --> 00:30:58.116 A:middle
but it's far more broad.

00:30:58.906 --> 00:31:00.036 A:middle
Use a breadth-first search

00:31:00.036 --> 00:31:02.056 A:middle
algorithm to complete the maze.

00:31:02.626 --> 00:31:04.076 A:middle
There are any number of ways

00:31:04.076 --> 00:31:05.146 A:middle
that I could complete this.

00:31:05.376 --> 00:31:06.466 A:middle
And, I have to have a lot of

00:31:06.466 --> 00:31:07.876 A:middle
knowledge in my brain already to

00:31:07.906 --> 00:31:09.316 A:middle
even understand what that goal

00:31:09.316 --> 00:31:10.726 A:middle
statement means.

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:14.916 A:middle
We still offer instructions, but

00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:17.396 A:middle
again, they're more broad, more

00:31:17.396 --> 00:31:18.086 A:middle
open-ended.

00:31:19.326 --> 00:31:20.846 A:middle
Start by adding all the tiles to

00:31:20.846 --> 00:31:21.506 A:middle
the queue.

00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:24.626 A:middle
Pop those tiles.

00:31:25.106 --> 00:31:27.946 A:middle
And there you go.

00:31:28.686 --> 00:31:32.226 A:middle
And then, in the user code

00:31:32.226 --> 00:31:34.296 A:middle
section, we just offer an empty

00:31:34.296 --> 00:31:37.166 A:middle
function and ask the user to use

00:31:37.166 --> 00:31:38.616 A:middle
their knowledge that they

00:31:38.616 --> 00:31:40.076 A:middle
already have, that we've taught

00:31:40.106 --> 00:31:41.776 A:middle
them a little bit of, to do

00:31:41.776 --> 00:31:42.036 A:middle
this.

00:31:42.496 --> 00:31:44.636 A:middle
Totally open-ended, overwhelming

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:46.126 A:middle
for a beginner, but for an

00:31:46.126 --> 00:31:48.006 A:middle
advanced learner, they know what

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:48.476 A:middle
to do.

00:31:48.476 --> 00:31:49.736 A:middle
They know how to complete this

00:31:49.736 --> 00:31:51.666 A:middle
task, and move on with the page.

00:31:56.046 --> 00:31:57.136 A:middle
What about a different style of

00:31:57.196 --> 00:31:57.686 A:middle
page?

00:31:59.336 --> 00:32:00.506 A:middle
Thinking about a concept.

00:32:02.316 --> 00:32:04.276 A:middle
In this one, we introduce Blink,

00:32:04.966 --> 00:32:06.226 A:middle
related to Conway's Game of

00:32:06.226 --> 00:32:07.876 A:middle
Life, which is essentially a

00:32:07.876 --> 00:32:09.696 A:middle
cell simulator, where cells live

00:32:09.696 --> 00:32:11.126 A:middle
and die depending on how many

00:32:11.126 --> 00:32:12.756 A:middle
neighbors they have around them.

00:32:13.346 --> 00:32:14.736 A:middle
It's a pretty complicated idea,

00:32:15.336 --> 00:32:16.576 A:middle
that can be broken down into

00:32:16.576 --> 00:32:17.296 A:middle
simple rules.

00:32:18.296 --> 00:32:19.816 A:middle
We give the learner a fair

00:32:19.816 --> 00:32:20.946 A:middle
amount of text here, because

00:32:20.946 --> 00:32:22.086 A:middle
we're introducing something

00:32:22.086 --> 00:32:22.626 A:middle
totally new.

00:32:22.626 --> 00:32:24.666 A:middle
And, that's part of our job, is

00:32:24.666 --> 00:32:26.696 A:middle
to explain that in detail, for

00:32:26.696 --> 00:32:27.636 A:middle
those who are interested.

00:32:29.026 --> 00:32:31.126 A:middle
We do have a goal statement, but

00:32:31.126 --> 00:32:33.556 A:middle
it's embedded, and the goal is

00:32:33.556 --> 00:32:35.186 A:middle
just to really understand these

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:36.376 A:middle
algorithms, to think.

00:32:36.766 --> 00:32:38.416 A:middle
There's no clear end point, no

00:32:38.416 --> 00:32:40.886 A:middle
time where the page tells you

00:32:40.886 --> 00:32:41.876 A:middle
you're ready to move on.

00:32:42.296 --> 00:32:44.156 A:middle
It's up to you, to understand

00:32:44.156 --> 00:32:45.776 A:middle
this, play around with the live

00:32:45.776 --> 00:32:47.616 A:middle
view, which you'll see in a

00:32:48.516 --> 00:32:48.676 A:middle
minute.

00:32:48.826 --> 00:32:49.956 A:middle
And, understand when you're

00:32:49.956 --> 00:32:50.936 A:middle
ready, as the learner.

00:32:51.416 --> 00:32:54.796 A:middle
We still offer this sort of

00:32:55.116 --> 00:32:56.866 A:middle
tl;dr version in the middle.

00:32:57.026 --> 00:32:58.206 A:middle
If you didn't want to read all

00:32:58.206 --> 00:33:00.016 A:middle
that prose at the top, here are

00:33:00.016 --> 00:33:01.336 A:middle
the rules of the simulation.

00:33:01.566 --> 00:33:02.546 A:middle
You can kind of get where you're

00:33:02.546 --> 00:33:03.416 A:middle
going with these.

00:33:04.016 --> 00:33:05.026 A:middle
So, it's somewhat similar

00:33:05.026 --> 00:33:06.596 A:middle
structure to completing a task,

00:33:06.906 --> 00:33:08.426 A:middle
but a totally different learner

00:33:08.426 --> 00:33:10.066 A:middle
goal, and author goal.

00:33:10.616 --> 00:33:15.886 A:middle
And then, finally, we have, kind

00:33:15.886 --> 00:33:17.516 A:middle
of instructions, at the bottom.

00:33:17.926 --> 00:33:19.026 A:middle
They're embedded, again.

00:33:19.506 --> 00:33:21.346 A:middle
Experiment with stepping through

00:33:21.346 --> 00:33:22.706 A:middle
the simulation, which we've

00:33:22.746 --> 00:33:24.166 A:middle
provided on the live view side.

00:33:24.766 --> 00:33:26.706 A:middle
Try it out, and then when you're

00:33:26.706 --> 00:33:28.656 A:middle
ready, go on to the next page to

00:33:28.656 --> 00:33:29.796 A:middle
explore what you'll be doing

00:33:29.796 --> 00:33:31.716 A:middle
with it.

00:33:31.926 --> 00:33:32.986 A:middle
What's the audience of this

00:33:32.986 --> 00:33:33.556 A:middle
page?

00:33:34.716 --> 00:33:35.656 A:middle
Is it advanced?

00:33:36.116 --> 00:33:39.266 A:middle
Beginner? Are they science

00:33:39.326 --> 00:33:39.796 A:middle
students?

00:33:40.206 --> 00:33:40.966 A:middle
Are they artists?

00:33:42.086 --> 00:33:42.866 A:middle
The way you're going to figure

00:33:42.866 --> 00:33:44.326 A:middle
that out is, you have your

00:33:44.326 --> 00:33:46.046 A:middle
target audience in mind, and

00:33:46.046 --> 00:33:47.536 A:middle
then you need to do user

00:33:47.536 --> 00:33:48.206 A:middle
testing.

00:33:48.646 --> 00:33:49.986 A:middle
Find out if this is too

00:33:49.986 --> 00:33:51.116 A:middle
complicated for them.

00:33:51.576 --> 00:33:52.946 A:middle
Figure out what words need to be

00:33:52.946 --> 00:33:54.896 A:middle
defined, what concepts need to

00:33:54.896 --> 00:33:56.766 A:middle
be explained more, or perhaps

00:33:56.766 --> 00:33:56.916 A:middle
less.

00:33:57.666 --> 00:33:58.706 A:middle
Don't underestimate your

00:33:58.706 --> 00:33:58.976 A:middle
audience either.

00:34:05.796 --> 00:34:07.376 A:middle
Is it coding time yet?

00:34:08.456 --> 00:34:10.366 A:middle
We've got all these ideas, we

00:34:10.366 --> 00:34:12.376 A:middle
understand the goal, the

00:34:12.376 --> 00:34:13.106 A:middle
audience.

00:34:13.606 --> 00:34:14.476 A:middle
We know all the parts of the

00:34:14.476 --> 00:34:15.896 A:middle
playground page, backward and

00:34:15.896 --> 00:34:16.426 A:middle
forward.

00:34:16.906 --> 00:34:18.706 A:middle
Surely, it must be coding time

00:34:18.706 --> 00:34:19.116 A:middle
now.

00:34:19.706 --> 00:34:23.906 A:middle
Not yet. I've moved from my

00:34:23.906 --> 00:34:25.436 A:middle
little notebook to my

00:34:25.436 --> 00:34:27.146 A:middle
whiteboard, but that's it.

00:34:27.146 --> 00:34:29.596 A:middle
I have expanded my ideas

00:34:29.596 --> 00:34:29.976 A:middle
somewhat.

00:34:29.976 --> 00:34:33.606 A:middle
I have some prose written down,

00:34:33.606 --> 00:34:35.476 A:middle
I have the coding section, I

00:34:35.476 --> 00:34:36.796 A:middle
have transitions.

00:34:37.336 --> 00:34:39.256 A:middle
Also, in this format, I can talk

00:34:39.256 --> 00:34:40.806 A:middle
to some of my co-workers in the

00:34:40.806 --> 00:34:40.996 A:middle
office.

00:34:41.556 --> 00:34:43.046 A:middle
Hey, Alex, does this make any

00:34:43.046 --> 00:34:43.626 A:middle
sense to you?

00:34:43.626 --> 00:34:45.416 A:middle
What do you think?

00:34:45.646 --> 00:34:46.876 A:middle
Is this a cool idea, Bill?

00:34:46.876 --> 00:34:49.626 A:middle
Would your kids like this?

00:34:49.836 --> 00:34:50.936 A:middle
It's really important to get

00:34:50.936 --> 00:34:53.016 A:middle
feedback from your actual users,

00:34:53.426 --> 00:34:54.596 A:middle
and from your colleagues, your

00:34:54.706 --> 00:34:55.116 A:middle
peers.

00:34:55.646 --> 00:34:57.086 A:middle
This is your prototyping phase,

00:34:57.086 --> 00:34:58.846 A:middle
to figure out what works and

00:34:58.846 --> 00:34:59.366 A:middle
what doesn't.

00:35:00.436 --> 00:35:01.886 A:middle
So, no, it is not coding time

00:35:01.886 --> 00:35:01.976 A:middle
yet.

00:35:06.796 --> 00:35:09.336 A:middle
So, we've talked through goal

00:35:09.336 --> 00:35:11.126 A:middle
and audience, and it's time to

00:35:11.126 --> 00:35:12.806 A:middle
talk about passion.

00:35:13.396 --> 00:35:15.296 A:middle
Passion is so important.

00:35:16.586 --> 00:35:17.556 A:middle
This should be threaded

00:35:17.556 --> 00:35:18.736 A:middle
throughout all your other

00:35:18.736 --> 00:35:20.136 A:middle
playground prototyping and

00:35:20.136 --> 00:35:20.696 A:middle
thinking.

00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:22.646 A:middle
Why are you even doing this?

00:35:22.646 --> 00:35:23.506 A:middle
Why are you writing a

00:35:23.506 --> 00:35:24.176 A:middle
playground?

00:35:24.766 --> 00:35:25.976 A:middle
It's because you're passionate

00:35:25.976 --> 00:35:27.076 A:middle
about something that you want to

00:35:27.076 --> 00:35:28.676 A:middle
share, that you want to teach to

00:35:28.676 --> 00:35:29.316 A:middle
someone else.

00:35:30.746 --> 00:35:31.946 A:middle
If you're not passionate about

00:35:31.946 --> 00:35:33.026 A:middle
what you're writing a playground

00:35:33.026 --> 00:35:34.396 A:middle
about, why are you doing it?

00:35:34.396 --> 00:35:37.966 A:middle
And that, that not passion is

00:35:37.966 --> 00:35:39.406 A:middle
going to show through, and your

00:35:39.406 --> 00:35:40.766 A:middle
learner's not care either.

00:35:41.426 --> 00:35:42.696 A:middle
So, bringing your passion to

00:35:42.696 --> 00:35:44.246 A:middle
this is so important.

00:35:44.746 --> 00:35:46.536 A:middle
How can you do this?

00:35:47.596 --> 00:35:49.436 A:middle
Well, let's take a look at the

00:35:49.436 --> 00:35:50.136 A:middle
live view.

00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:53.156 A:middle
I said this before, this is

00:35:53.156 --> 00:35:54.656 A:middle
where the learner is going to

00:35:54.656 --> 00:35:56.586 A:middle
get to experience their code

00:35:56.586 --> 00:35:57.106 A:middle
running.

00:35:57.576 --> 00:35:58.686 A:middle
This is where they're going to

00:35:58.686 --> 00:36:00.196 A:middle
get excited about creating,

00:36:00.196 --> 00:36:01.436 A:middle
about what they've made.

00:36:02.026 --> 00:36:03.406 A:middle
So, this is your chance to make

00:36:03.406 --> 00:36:05.056 A:middle
that experience as visually

00:36:05.056 --> 00:36:07.026 A:middle
exciting, as auditorily

00:36:07.026 --> 00:36:09.676 A:middle
exciting, as exciting period,

00:36:10.006 --> 00:36:10.826 A:middle
for your users.

00:36:11.816 --> 00:36:13.106 A:middle
Here's Learn to Code, where we

00:36:13.106 --> 00:36:14.506 A:middle
have this adorable character,

00:36:14.696 --> 00:36:16.616 A:middle
this cool, game-style world.

00:36:17.166 --> 00:36:18.546 A:middle
This appeals to a lot of people.

00:36:19.456 --> 00:36:20.896 A:middle
Gets them excited about jumping

00:36:20.896 --> 00:36:21.866 A:middle
into this world and writing

00:36:21.866 --> 00:36:21.956 A:middle
code.

00:36:25.046 --> 00:36:26.356 A:middle
Here's another example of

00:36:26.356 --> 00:36:26.946 A:middle
spirals.

00:36:27.756 --> 00:36:29.966 A:middle
I had so much fun working on

00:36:30.026 --> 00:36:31.196 A:middle
this, I would get totally

00:36:31.196 --> 00:36:33.096 A:middle
distracted trying to de-bug by

00:36:33.096 --> 00:36:34.906 A:middle
just creating cool new spirals

00:36:34.906 --> 00:36:36.166 A:middle
and modifying variables.

00:36:36.796 --> 00:36:37.976 A:middle
That's a great sign.

00:36:38.006 --> 00:36:40.216 A:middle
If you enjoy going through the

00:36:40.216 --> 00:36:42.426 A:middle
tasks in your playground book,

00:36:42.426 --> 00:36:44.956 A:middle
your learners probably will too.

00:36:44.956 --> 00:36:46.076 A:middle
And, on the other hand, if

00:36:46.076 --> 00:36:47.716 A:middle
you're bored by the exercises,

00:36:48.016 --> 00:36:48.986 A:middle
if you wonder why you're

00:36:48.986 --> 00:36:51.106 A:middle
teaching this, how are you going

00:36:51.106 --> 00:36:52.316 A:middle
to get your learner motivated to

00:36:52.316 --> 00:36:53.106 A:middle
go through them either?

00:36:53.706 --> 00:36:55.156 A:middle
You have to be excited about

00:36:55.156 --> 00:36:56.696 A:middle
what you're doing, to bring your

00:36:56.696 --> 00:36:58.016 A:middle
passion to those views.

00:36:58.386 --> 00:37:00.786 A:middle
Here's another cool example,

00:37:00.886 --> 00:37:01.976 A:middle
totally different style.

00:37:02.536 --> 00:37:03.676 A:middle
This is, Blink.

00:37:04.196 --> 00:37:05.666 A:middle
From that page of text you saw

00:37:05.666 --> 00:37:06.166 A:middle
earlier.

00:37:06.916 --> 00:37:08.076 A:middle
We have all that text, but we

00:37:08.076 --> 00:37:09.206 A:middle
also have this rich,

00:37:09.396 --> 00:37:11.356 A:middle
interactive, live view on the

00:37:11.356 --> 00:37:12.856 A:middle
right hand side, where the

00:37:12.856 --> 00:37:13.686 A:middle
learner can play with the

00:37:13.686 --> 00:37:15.136 A:middle
algorithm, they can use touch

00:37:15.136 --> 00:37:18.146 A:middle
gestures to interact with it.

00:37:18.486 --> 00:37:19.866 A:middle
This is the place where passion

00:37:20.386 --> 00:37:20.976 A:middle
can really shine.

00:37:26.936 --> 00:37:30.856 A:middle
So. We have the marriage of

00:37:30.996 --> 00:37:32.746 A:middle
teaching that Bill talked to you

00:37:32.746 --> 00:37:35.356 A:middle
about, and designing that I

00:37:35.356 --> 00:37:36.176 A:middle
talked to you about.

00:37:37.026 --> 00:37:39.186 A:middle
It's so important to keep these

00:37:39.186 --> 00:37:40.706 A:middle
in mind, the teaching aspect,

00:37:40.706 --> 00:37:41.536 A:middle
what you're trying to get

00:37:41.536 --> 00:37:44.186 A:middle
across, and how you're designing

00:37:44.186 --> 00:37:44.326 A:middle
it.

00:37:44.586 --> 00:37:45.766 A:middle
How you're prototyping it.

00:37:46.016 --> 00:37:47.336 A:middle
Who you're talking to for help,

00:37:47.576 --> 00:37:49.286 A:middle
how often you're user testing.

00:37:49.746 --> 00:37:53.026 A:middle
With these two-- when these

00:37:53.026 --> 00:37:55.346 A:middle
powers combine, we are Captain

00:37:55.346 --> 00:37:56.266 A:middle
Amazing Teacher.

00:37:56.916 --> 00:38:03.526 A:middle
So. Get ready for it.

00:38:03.796 --> 00:38:04.836 A:middle
Coding time.

[ Applause ]

00:38:11.966 --> 00:38:13.896 A:middle
Once you have your prototype, or

00:38:13.896 --> 00:38:15.546 A:middle
excuse me, storyboard figured

00:38:15.546 --> 00:38:15.876 A:middle
out.

00:38:15.876 --> 00:38:17.756 A:middle
Once you've solicited feedback,

00:38:17.916 --> 00:38:19.846 A:middle
talked to your users, talked to

00:38:19.846 --> 00:38:21.016 A:middle
whoever wanted you to make this

00:38:21.066 --> 00:38:22.176 A:middle
playground in the first place,

00:38:22.176 --> 00:38:23.096 A:middle
if it wasn't you.

00:38:23.416 --> 00:38:24.536 A:middle
You've gotten all those things

00:38:24.536 --> 00:38:25.996 A:middle
together, you know what you want

00:38:25.996 --> 00:38:27.566 A:middle
your hints to be, you know what

00:38:27.566 --> 00:38:28.776 A:middle
you want your success messages

00:38:28.776 --> 00:38:29.796 A:middle
to be, how you're going to

00:38:29.796 --> 00:38:30.996 A:middle
assist your learner in all the

00:38:30.996 --> 00:38:31.816 A:middle
best ways.

00:38:31.816 --> 00:38:33.946 A:middle
You've got a storyboard, now it

00:38:33.946 --> 00:38:35.306 A:middle
is time for you to write code,

00:38:35.306 --> 00:38:36.936 A:middle
and make that awesome playground

00:38:36.936 --> 00:38:38.316 A:middle
idea a reality.

00:38:38.986 --> 00:38:40.196 A:middle
And, you don't need me to teach

00:38:40.196 --> 00:38:43.116 A:middle
you how to code.

00:38:43.376 --> 00:38:45.906 A:middle
So, you can probably all say it

00:38:45.906 --> 00:38:47.876 A:middle
with me now at this point, but

00:38:47.876 --> 00:38:49.606 A:middle
the three things to take away

00:38:49.606 --> 00:38:53.276 A:middle
from this presentation are goal,

00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:59.546 A:middle
audience, and passion.

00:39:00.026 --> 00:39:00.766 A:middle
That's right.

00:39:01.746 --> 00:39:03.286 A:middle
And so, with those things in

00:39:03.286 --> 00:39:05.506 A:middle
mind, I say to you all, go

00:39:05.506 --> 00:39:06.976 A:middle
forth, and teach.

There were some related--

00:39:28.426 --> 00:39:29.766 A:middle
awesome related sessions this

00:39:29.766 --> 00:39:32.136 A:middle
year, which have all passed, but

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:33.286 A:middle
you can watch them online.

00:39:33.786 --> 00:39:36.346 A:middle
And so, thank you all so much

00:39:36.346 --> 00:39:36.886 A:middle
for coming.

00:39:37.356 --> 00:39:39.136 A:middle

your homes.

00:39:39.716 --> 00:39:41.466 A:middle
And I can't wait to see you all

00:39:41.466 --> 00:39:43.346 A:middle
next year at WWDC 2018.
