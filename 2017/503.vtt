[ Crowd Sounds ]

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:27.616 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone and thank

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:29.046 A:middle
you for coming to this session.

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.276 A:middle
My name is Athar Shah.

00:00:31.276 --> 00:00:33.016 A:middle
And I'm a manager here at Apple

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:34.356 A:middle
in the core media software team.

00:00:34.356 --> 00:00:36.336 A:middle
And we at Apple are really

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:37.756 A:middle
excited to talk to you today

00:00:37.756 --> 00:00:39.456 A:middle
about two new media

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:40.216 A:middle
technologies.

00:00:41.226 --> 00:00:42.386 A:middle
In particular, we're going to be

00:00:42.386 --> 00:00:44.816 A:middle
talking about a new codec for

00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:46.266 A:middle
video and image compression

00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:50.076 A:middle
called HEVC and a file format

00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:51.646 A:middle
for images that we're adopting

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:52.866 A:middle
called HEIF.

00:00:54.206 --> 00:00:55.276 A:middle
But before we get into the

00:00:55.276 --> 00:00:57.566 A:middle
details, if you've downloaded

00:00:57.806 --> 00:00:59.666 A:middle
the developer seed, the latest

00:00:59.696 --> 00:01:01.566 A:middle
build, then on certain iOS

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:03.956 A:middle
devices you are already

00:01:03.956 --> 00:01:06.226 A:middle
capturing and using these new

00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:08.056 A:middle
technologies and file formats.

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:10.356 A:middle
And if you pay close attention,

00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:13.036 A:middle
you'll notice that these files

00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:15.036 A:middle
are a lot smaller than they used

00:01:15.036 --> 00:01:15.916 A:middle
to be.

00:01:16.026 --> 00:01:17.596 A:middle
Later on in the presentation,

00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:18.886 A:middle
Gavin will talk to you about the

00:01:18.886 --> 00:01:22.406 A:middle
specifics of our platforms and

00:01:22.406 --> 00:01:23.916 A:middle
how we support these

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:25.636 A:middle
technologies in hardware and in

00:01:25.636 --> 00:01:26.196 A:middle
software.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.106 A:middle
So we're going to be going over

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:34.516 A:middle
the landscape of media as it is

00:01:34.576 --> 00:01:36.406 A:middle
today, why we need to change.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.956 A:middle
We'll talk about what are HEVC

00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:41.716 A:middle
and HEIF and why we decided to

00:01:41.716 --> 00:01:43.036 A:middle
adopt them here at Apple.

00:01:43.476 --> 00:01:45.676 A:middle
And then finally, we'll give an

00:01:45.676 --> 00:01:48.506 A:middle
overview of how we've adopted

00:01:48.506 --> 00:01:49.696 A:middle
these technologies within the

00:01:49.696 --> 00:01:52.216 A:middle
Apple ecosystem and then also

00:01:52.396 --> 00:01:54.006 A:middle
provide some guidance on how you

00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:55.286 A:middle
can take advantage of these

00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:57.176 A:middle
within your apps for your use

00:01:57.176 --> 00:01:57.556 A:middle
cases.

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:03.356 A:middle
So let's talk about media today.

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:06.546 A:middle
The world is becoming more and

00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:07.396 A:middle
more visual.

00:02:07.846 --> 00:02:10.406 A:middle
And both consumers and producers

00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:12.836 A:middle
are generating more and more

00:02:13.336 --> 00:02:15.116 A:middle
video and media related content.

00:02:15.996 --> 00:02:17.966 A:middle
Not only that, the content is

00:02:18.026 --> 00:02:20.176 A:middle
taking new forms like high

00:02:20.176 --> 00:02:23.926 A:middle
resolution 4K video, HDR video,

00:02:24.246 --> 00:02:26.346 A:middle
wide color or wide gamut video

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:26.936 A:middle
and so on.

00:02:28.336 --> 00:02:29.686 A:middle
The nature of media is also

00:02:29.686 --> 00:02:32.966 A:middle
changing with, you know, our

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:34.096 A:middle
personal favorite being live

00:02:34.096 --> 00:02:35.396 A:middle
photos but there's lots of

00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:36.806 A:middle
content out there, short-form

00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:38.436 A:middle
video and so one.

00:02:39.436 --> 00:02:41.156 A:middle
Bandwidth continues to be at a

00:02:41.156 --> 00:02:41.786 A:middle
premium.

00:02:42.046 --> 00:02:43.836 A:middle
And certain applications and use

00:02:43.876 --> 00:02:45.726 A:middle
cases like over-the-top video

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:48.146 A:middle
delivery and wireless networks

00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:50.556 A:middle
place a premium on the amount of

00:02:50.556 --> 00:02:51.106 A:middle
bandwidth.

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:53.016 A:middle
And anything we can do to reduce

00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:54.086 A:middle
the bandwidth requirements

00:02:54.086 --> 00:02:55.236 A:middle
really helps out those use

00:02:55.236 --> 00:02:55.726 A:middle
cases.

00:02:57.166 --> 00:03:00.236 A:middle
So we've been using H.264 and

00:03:00.236 --> 00:03:01.506 A:middle
JPEG for a while.

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:03.406 A:middle
There are limits to what these

00:03:03.506 --> 00:03:06.246 A:middle
codecs can do in this evolving

00:03:06.246 --> 00:03:07.376 A:middle
landscape with these new

00:03:07.376 --> 00:03:08.086 A:middle
challenges.

00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:11.156 A:middle
And that leads us to HEVC.

00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:13.016 A:middle
We were looking for a

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:15.146 A:middle
next-generation codec that we

00:03:15.146 --> 00:03:18.076 A:middle
could use both for movies and

00:03:18.076 --> 00:03:19.396 A:middle
for photos or images.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:20.926 A:middle
And we were looking for

00:03:20.926 --> 00:03:22.056 A:middle
something that was going to give

00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:24.476 A:middle
us significant benefits over

00:03:24.476 --> 00:03:27.826 A:middle
what exists today.

00:03:27.986 --> 00:03:30.896 A:middle
So having evaluated our options,

00:03:31.016 --> 00:03:32.986 A:middle
we decided to select HEVC.

00:03:32.986 --> 00:03:36.956 A:middle
HEVC stands for High Efficiency

00:03:36.956 --> 00:03:37.756 A:middle
Video Coding.

00:03:38.376 --> 00:03:39.626 A:middle
It is a state-of-the-art

00:03:40.326 --> 00:03:41.846 A:middle
industry standard that was

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:43.986 A:middle
adopted and approved in 2013.

00:03:45.056 --> 00:03:48.046 A:middle
It was ratified by ISO as MPEG-H

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:52.556 A:middle
part 2 and by ITU as H.265.

00:03:53.676 --> 00:03:55.026 A:middle
We're going to be calling it and

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:57.266 A:middle
referring to it as HEVC.

00:03:57.336 --> 00:04:00.296 A:middle
And Apple is adopting it as its

00:04:00.296 --> 00:04:02.406 A:middle
next-generation codec.

00:04:03.736 --> 00:04:05.146 A:middle
So we'll spend a couple of

00:04:05.146 --> 00:04:07.496 A:middle
minutes talking about what makes

00:04:07.496 --> 00:04:09.356 A:middle
HEVC such a great codec.

00:04:09.506 --> 00:04:13.376 A:middle
Now HEVC is similar to H.264 in

00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:14.886 A:middle
that it is a codec that

00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:18.536 A:middle
processes videos and frames in

00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:19.146 A:middle
blocks.

00:04:19.976 --> 00:04:22.976 A:middle
And it uses temporal and spatial

00:04:22.976 --> 00:04:24.826 A:middle
compression techniques to get

00:04:24.826 --> 00:04:26.006 A:middle
the compression benefits.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.596 A:middle
Now H.264 has a notion of macro

00:04:29.596 --> 00:04:32.696 A:middle
blocks, which are 16 x 16 size

00:04:32.696 --> 00:04:34.576 A:middle
blocks that are used within the

00:04:34.576 --> 00:04:36.046 A:middle
codec for processing.

00:04:36.746 --> 00:04:40.396 A:middle
HEVC introduces notion of CTUs

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:41.486 A:middle
or coding tree units.

00:04:41.926 --> 00:04:43.736 A:middle
And these it start down at 4 x 4

00:04:44.396 --> 00:04:48.116 A:middle
and go all the way up to 64 x

00:04:48.116 --> 00:04:48.756 A:middle
64.

00:04:49.716 --> 00:04:51.646 A:middle
And it's when you can use these

00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:54.996 A:middle
larger sizes is when you realize

00:04:55.056 --> 00:04:56.346 A:middle
the greater compression benefit.

00:04:57.446 --> 00:04:59.936 A:middle
And this is especially true when

00:04:59.936 --> 00:05:00.956 A:middle
you're dealing with high

00:05:00.956 --> 00:05:03.826 A:middle
resolution videos and images.

00:05:03.826 --> 00:05:05.196 A:middle
You can really take advantage of

00:05:05.846 --> 00:05:05.966 A:middle
this.

00:05:07.116 --> 00:05:10.636 A:middle
Similarly, H.264 had 4 x 4 and 8

00:05:10.636 --> 00:05:13.736 A:middle
x 8 DCT or discrete cosine

00:05:13.736 --> 00:05:18.476 A:middle
transform, whereas HEVC not only

00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:19.806 A:middle
uses a discrete cosine

00:05:19.806 --> 00:05:21.486 A:middle
transform, it also uses a DST,

00:05:21.486 --> 00:05:23.066 A:middle
distribute sine transform.

00:05:23.576 --> 00:05:25.076 A:middle
And similarly, with the coding

00:05:25.076 --> 00:05:27.276 A:middle
block sizes for the transform

00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:30.226 A:middle
blocks, it also goes up to 32 x

00:05:30.226 --> 00:05:30.736 A:middle
32.

00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:34.096 A:middle
To get better spatial

00:05:34.096 --> 00:05:36.696 A:middle
compression, HEVC introduces

00:05:36.696 --> 00:05:38.256 A:middle
additional directional modes.

00:05:38.256 --> 00:05:41.456 A:middle
While H.264 had up to nine, HEVC

00:05:41.456 --> 00:05:43.346 A:middle
has up to 35.

00:05:45.456 --> 00:05:48.316 A:middle
A key part of being able to do a

00:05:48.506 --> 00:05:49.866 A:middle
high degree of compression

00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:51.526 A:middle
involves motion estimation or

00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:53.126 A:middle
motion compensation.

00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:56.616 A:middle
And this is where you try to

00:05:56.616 --> 00:05:58.756 A:middle
find -- you basically have a

00:05:58.756 --> 00:06:01.136 A:middle
block in your current image that

00:06:01.136 --> 00:06:02.896 A:middle
you're trying to predict from a

00:06:02.956 --> 00:06:03.926 A:middle
previous image.

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:05.086 A:middle
And what you can do is say, you

00:06:05.086 --> 00:06:05.426 A:middle
know what?

00:06:05.786 --> 00:06:07.756 A:middle
This block is that same block

00:06:07.756 --> 00:06:09.376 A:middle
from the past but moved over by

00:06:09.376 --> 00:06:10.576 A:middle
a certain number of pixels.

00:06:11.566 --> 00:06:14.906 A:middle
Sometimes you don't always land

00:06:14.906 --> 00:06:15.836 A:middle
in a pixel's boundary.

00:06:15.836 --> 00:06:17.046 A:middle
For example, you know, something

00:06:17.046 --> 00:06:18.236 A:middle
could have moved five pixels

00:06:18.236 --> 00:06:18.996 A:middle
over but it could have moved

00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:20.436 A:middle
five-and-a-half pixels over or

00:06:20.436 --> 00:06:21.906 A:middle
five-and-a-quarter pixels over.

00:06:22.976 --> 00:06:23.986 A:middle
When you need to do motion

00:06:23.986 --> 00:06:26.266 A:middle
estimation at that half pixel or

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:28.206 A:middle
quarter pixel boundary, you need

00:06:28.206 --> 00:06:29.356 A:middle
to be able to generate those

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:30.686 A:middle
pixels with accuracy and

00:06:30.686 --> 00:06:32.216 A:middle
precision because those don't

00:06:32.216 --> 00:06:32.566 A:middle
exist.

00:06:32.566 --> 00:06:33.586 A:middle
You just have to pixels at the

00:06:33.586 --> 00:06:34.206 A:middle
boundaries.

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:37.616 A:middle
And so as you can see, HEVC has

00:06:37.616 --> 00:06:40.306 A:middle
advanced filtering which can be

00:06:40.306 --> 00:06:42.756 A:middle
used to generate those sub-pel

00:06:42.756 --> 00:06:44.806 A:middle
and quarter-pel pixels with much

00:06:44.806 --> 00:06:46.226 A:middle
more accuracy and precision.

00:06:46.496 --> 00:06:47.646 A:middle
And that leads to better motion

00:06:47.646 --> 00:06:49.566 A:middle
estimation compensation and,

00:06:49.566 --> 00:06:51.646 A:middle
hence, better compression.

00:06:52.806 --> 00:06:54.456 A:middle
Finally, if you're familiar with

00:06:54.816 --> 00:06:56.796 A:middle
block-based codecs, we talked

00:06:56.796 --> 00:06:59.656 A:middle
about H.264 having macro blocks,

00:07:00.046 --> 00:07:01.576 A:middle
sometimes you can actually see

00:07:01.576 --> 00:07:04.486 A:middle
in the coded video, artifacts

00:07:04.486 --> 00:07:06.646 A:middle
around the edges of that block.

00:07:06.646 --> 00:07:07.456 A:middle
We call those blocking

00:07:07.456 --> 00:07:07.966 A:middle
artifacts.

00:07:07.966 --> 00:07:12.136 A:middle
H.264 introduced a loop filter

00:07:12.576 --> 00:07:14.986 A:middle
called the deblocking filter

00:07:15.316 --> 00:07:16.666 A:middle
that helps get rid of a lot of

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:17.606 A:middle
those artifacts.

00:07:18.036 --> 00:07:19.676 A:middle
Now HEVC improves upon that

00:07:19.736 --> 00:07:21.916 A:middle
filter, but it takes it a step

00:07:21.976 --> 00:07:23.546 A:middle
further and introduces a second

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.746 A:middle
sequential step where we run a

00:07:25.796 --> 00:07:27.636 A:middle
sample adaptive offset filter

00:07:27.886 --> 00:07:28.866 A:middle
which gives us even better

00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:29.376 A:middle
results.

00:07:29.936 --> 00:07:30.856 A:middle
So now these are some of the

00:07:30.856 --> 00:07:32.926 A:middle
highlights that give us a better

00:07:32.926 --> 00:07:35.446 A:middle
compression in HEVC.

00:07:35.446 --> 00:07:36.246 A:middle
And there is more.

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:38.496 A:middle
So having said that, how much

00:07:38.496 --> 00:07:39.846 A:middle
improvement are we talking

00:07:39.846 --> 00:07:40.176 A:middle
about?

00:07:40.446 --> 00:07:42.606 A:middle
And this is why we're excited

00:07:42.606 --> 00:07:44.136 A:middle
about introducing this next

00:07:44.136 --> 00:07:45.386 A:middle
generation codec at Apple.

00:07:46.186 --> 00:07:47.576 A:middle
In the case of general video

00:07:47.576 --> 00:07:49.666 A:middle
content, we're seeing an up to

00:07:49.666 --> 00:07:51.836 A:middle
40 percent compression

00:07:51.836 --> 00:07:53.816 A:middle
improvement over H.264.

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:55.966 A:middle
So you can generate the same

00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:57.446 A:middle
quality video as you were doing

00:07:57.446 --> 00:07:59.276 A:middle
previously but reduced 40

00:07:59.276 --> 00:08:00.396 A:middle
percent less bandwidth.

00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:01.966 A:middle
Or you could keep the same

00:08:01.966 --> 00:08:03.306 A:middle
bandwidth and significantly

00:08:03.306 --> 00:08:05.256 A:middle
improve the video quality.

00:08:05.716 --> 00:08:07.056 A:middle
And we've done quite a bit of

00:08:07.056 --> 00:08:08.976 A:middle
subjective and objective testing

00:08:09.336 --> 00:08:10.646 A:middle
to fine-tune the video to

00:08:10.646 --> 00:08:11.796 A:middle
realize these benefits.

00:08:12.906 --> 00:08:14.616 A:middle
In some use cases, we're seeing

00:08:14.616 --> 00:08:15.806 A:middle
an even greater benefit.

00:08:16.436 --> 00:08:18.186 A:middle
So we've really optimized our

00:08:18.186 --> 00:08:19.936 A:middle
end-to-end pipeline with the iOS

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:20.866 A:middle
Camera Capture.

00:08:21.306 --> 00:08:22.886 A:middle
And in this use case, we're

00:08:22.886 --> 00:08:25.276 A:middle
seeing an up to 2x improvement

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:26.736 A:middle
over H.264.

00:08:27.496 --> 00:08:28.736 A:middle
What this means is you're able

00:08:28.736 --> 00:08:30.386 A:middle
to now store twice as many

00:08:30.386 --> 00:08:32.926 A:middle
movies as you could previously

00:08:32.926 --> 00:08:34.136 A:middle
with H.264.

00:08:36.676 --> 00:08:38.466 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit about

00:08:38.556 --> 00:08:40.336 A:middle
the specifics of what we are

00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:40.916 A:middle
supporting.

00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:45.556 A:middle
Like H.264, HEVC also has the

00:08:45.556 --> 00:08:46.666 A:middle
notion of profiles.

00:08:47.396 --> 00:08:49.476 A:middle
And in HEVC, we're supporting

00:08:49.476 --> 00:08:52.336 A:middle
the Main profile, the Main Still

00:08:52.336 --> 00:08:54.266 A:middle
Picture profile, and finally the

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:55.636 A:middle
Main 10 profile.

00:08:56.226 --> 00:08:58.566 A:middle
So with the Main 10 profile, we

00:08:58.566 --> 00:09:00.716 A:middle
are now able to encode and

00:09:00.716 --> 00:09:02.976 A:middle
decode video with 10-bit

00:09:03.026 --> 00:09:03.626 A:middle
precision.

00:09:04.246 --> 00:09:05.176 A:middle
This means that you can

00:09:05.176 --> 00:09:06.966 A:middle
represent more gray scales and

00:09:06.966 --> 00:09:08.876 A:middle
more colors and increase the

00:09:08.876 --> 00:09:10.656 A:middle
overall quality of the video

00:09:11.026 --> 00:09:12.746 A:middle
end-to-end across our pipeline.

00:09:13.216 --> 00:09:18.836 A:middle
With HEVC, we are requiring the

00:09:18.836 --> 00:09:22.126 A:middle
hvc1 codec type for playback.

00:09:23.046 --> 00:09:24.576 A:middle
This means that the parameter

00:09:24.576 --> 00:09:26.096 A:middle
sets have to be stored in the

00:09:26.096 --> 00:09:28.486 A:middle
decoder configuration record as

00:09:28.486 --> 00:09:29.956 A:middle
opposed to within the samples or

00:09:29.956 --> 00:09:31.516 A:middle
the payload itself.

00:09:32.046 --> 00:09:33.426 A:middle
So make sure when you are

00:09:33.426 --> 00:09:35.936 A:middle
creating HEVC assets that they

00:09:35.936 --> 00:09:38.776 A:middle
are the hvc1 codec type to

00:09:38.776 --> 00:09:40.426 A:middle
enable playback within the Apple

00:09:40.426 --> 00:09:41.056 A:middle
ecosystem.

00:09:44.796 --> 00:09:47.426 A:middle
Finally, we're lucky in that we

00:09:47.426 --> 00:09:48.996 A:middle
can take advantage of the fact

00:09:48.996 --> 00:09:51.236 A:middle
that HEVC naturally fits into

00:09:51.236 --> 00:09:53.266 A:middle
the existing file formats.

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.206 A:middle
So it fits nicely within the

00:09:55.206 --> 00:09:57.116 A:middle
QuickTime movie file format as

00:09:57.116 --> 00:09:59.586 A:middle
well as the ISO MPEG-4 file

00:09:59.636 --> 00:10:00.066 A:middle
format.

00:10:02.776 --> 00:10:05.086 A:middle
So we picked a technology that

00:10:05.086 --> 00:10:06.536 A:middle
is well supported within the

00:10:06.536 --> 00:10:08.416 A:middle
industry and within Apple's

00:10:08.416 --> 00:10:09.066 A:middle
ecosystem.

00:10:09.966 --> 00:10:10.946 A:middle
It has both hardware and

00:10:10.946 --> 00:10:11.826 A:middle
software support.

00:10:12.306 --> 00:10:13.086 A:middle
And later on in the

00:10:13.086 --> 00:10:14.786 A:middle
presentation, Gavin will go into

00:10:14.786 --> 00:10:18.186 A:middle
the details about where and how

00:10:18.186 --> 00:10:18.886 A:middle
that's supported.

00:10:21.936 --> 00:10:24.096 A:middle
It works already with the file

00:10:24.096 --> 00:10:25.616 A:middle
formats that we've talked about.

00:10:25.616 --> 00:10:27.036 A:middle
So it's supporting the QuickTime

00:10:27.036 --> 00:10:28.766 A:middle
movie file format and within the

00:10:28.766 --> 00:10:30.046 A:middle
MPEG-4 file format.

00:10:30.766 --> 00:10:32.656 A:middle
And finally, it's an ideal codec

00:10:33.086 --> 00:10:35.686 A:middle
for both movies as well as still

00:10:35.686 --> 00:10:37.926 A:middle
images, allowing us to use it in

00:10:37.926 --> 00:10:40.896 A:middle
place of H.264 and JPEG.

00:10:41.496 --> 00:10:43.216 A:middle
Now as I've mentioned, HEVC can

00:10:43.216 --> 00:10:45.126 A:middle
use the existing movie file

00:10:45.126 --> 00:10:45.736 A:middle
formats.

00:10:46.216 --> 00:10:48.466 A:middle
That's not the case for when we

00:10:48.466 --> 00:10:49.836 A:middle
want to use it for photos or

00:10:49.836 --> 00:10:50.376 A:middle
images.

00:10:50.786 --> 00:10:52.866 A:middle
So we needed to find a different

00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:54.246 A:middle
file format that we could use

00:10:54.246 --> 00:10:56.416 A:middle
for images that would allow us

00:10:56.496 --> 00:10:58.746 A:middle
to use HEVC as the codec and

00:10:59.066 --> 00:11:01.276 A:middle
that's where HEIF comes in.

00:11:02.776 --> 00:11:05.096 A:middle
So before we get into HEIF,

00:11:05.226 --> 00:11:06.496 A:middle
let's talk a little bit about

00:11:06.496 --> 00:11:08.466 A:middle
the requirements that we wanted

00:11:08.576 --> 00:11:11.496 A:middle
satisfied when adopting a new

00:11:11.496 --> 00:11:13.406 A:middle
file format for images.

00:11:14.606 --> 00:11:15.616 A:middle
We wanted support for

00:11:15.616 --> 00:11:17.236 A:middle
state-of-the-art compression

00:11:17.236 --> 00:11:19.206 A:middle
technology with HEVC being the

00:11:19.206 --> 00:11:20.576 A:middle
primary consideration.

00:11:21.866 --> 00:11:24.086 A:middle
We wanted explicit support for

00:11:24.086 --> 00:11:25.806 A:middle
alpha and depth channels as

00:11:25.856 --> 00:11:27.396 A:middle
primary asset types.

00:11:28.436 --> 00:11:30.756 A:middle
We needed support for animation

00:11:31.136 --> 00:11:33.976 A:middle
with animated GIF or JIF and

00:11:33.976 --> 00:11:34.926 A:middle
Live Photo.

00:11:35.296 --> 00:11:38.766 A:middle
In addition to just still image

00:11:38.766 --> 00:11:41.096 A:middle
support, we wanted support for

00:11:41.096 --> 00:11:43.356 A:middle
image sequences, to be able to

00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:44.856 A:middle
compress and represent those in

00:11:44.856 --> 00:11:46.886 A:middle
a file format such as what

00:11:47.036 --> 00:11:48.476 A:middle
happens when you're dealing with

00:11:48.476 --> 00:11:49.986 A:middle
bursts of photos.

00:11:51.286 --> 00:11:52.926 A:middle
And finally, with images getting

00:11:52.926 --> 00:11:55.026 A:middle
larger and larger in size, it

00:11:55.026 --> 00:11:57.376 A:middle
was important for us to be able

00:11:57.376 --> 00:11:59.106 A:middle
to process these efficiently

00:11:59.496 --> 00:12:00.606 A:middle
with low latency and a

00:12:00.606 --> 00:12:02.026 A:middle
reasonable amount of

00:12:02.506 --> 00:12:03.386 A:middle
performance.

00:12:03.616 --> 00:12:04.756 A:middle
So when you've got a massive

00:12:04.756 --> 00:12:06.566 A:middle
image, you want to be able to

00:12:06.866 --> 00:12:08.986 A:middle
download it and start to preview

00:12:08.986 --> 00:12:09.966 A:middle
it immediately.

00:12:10.306 --> 00:12:11.666 A:middle
And if you're interested in a

00:12:11.706 --> 00:12:13.366 A:middle
particular smaller region in a

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:15.726 A:middle
much wider image, you want to be

00:12:15.726 --> 00:12:18.006 A:middle
able to just decode and process

00:12:18.046 --> 00:12:19.676 A:middle
the relevant tiles.

00:12:20.196 --> 00:12:21.006 A:middle
And so we were looking for

00:12:21.006 --> 00:12:22.376 A:middle
something that would allow us to

00:12:22.376 --> 00:12:25.676 A:middle
take advantage of this kind of a

00:12:26.436 --> 00:12:27.296 A:middle
pipeline.

00:12:27.596 --> 00:12:29.246 A:middle
So with these requirements in

00:12:29.246 --> 00:12:30.826 A:middle
mind, we looked at a few options

00:12:31.106 --> 00:12:32.346 A:middle
and we selected HEIF.

00:12:33.456 --> 00:12:35.086 A:middle
HEIF stands for High Efficiency

00:12:35.126 --> 00:12:36.056 A:middle
Image File Format.

00:12:36.986 --> 00:12:39.906 A:middle
And like HEVC, it is also an

00:12:39.906 --> 00:12:41.626 A:middle
industry standard that was

00:12:41.626 --> 00:12:44.476 A:middle
ratified by ISO in 2015.

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:48.406 A:middle
It's based on the familiar ISO

00:12:48.406 --> 00:12:49.956 A:middle
Base Media File Format.

00:12:50.696 --> 00:12:53.716 A:middle
It is extremely feature-rich.

00:12:54.836 --> 00:12:56.786 A:middle
And it supports both individual

00:12:56.786 --> 00:12:58.286 A:middle
images and sequences.

00:12:59.436 --> 00:13:01.446 A:middle
There are many use cases in

00:13:01.446 --> 00:13:02.836 A:middle
addition to that, that are

00:13:02.836 --> 00:13:04.196 A:middle
supported by this file format

00:13:04.726 --> 00:13:05.756 A:middle
which allows for future

00:13:05.756 --> 00:13:06.656 A:middle
extensibility.

00:13:07.216 --> 00:13:12.316 A:middle
It typically uses HEVC for

00:13:12.316 --> 00:13:13.106 A:middle
compression.

00:13:13.156 --> 00:13:14.426 A:middle
It has the option where you can

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:15.746 A:middle
use other encoders.

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:17.606 A:middle
But at Apple, when we're

00:13:17.606 --> 00:13:20.066 A:middle
generating HEIF assets, they

00:13:20.066 --> 00:13:23.566 A:middle
will only be using the HEVC

00:13:24.476 --> 00:13:24.706 A:middle
encoder.

00:13:24.796 --> 00:13:26.236 A:middle
So why do all this for images?

00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:29.216 A:middle
We saw the benefits for movies

00:13:29.216 --> 00:13:30.076 A:middle
and videos.

00:13:30.596 --> 00:13:32.366 A:middle
And for images, we're also

00:13:32.366 --> 00:13:33.746 A:middle
seeing tremendous gains over

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:34.236 A:middle
JPEG.

00:13:34.656 --> 00:13:37.706 A:middle
So now using HEVC within HEIF,

00:13:38.496 --> 00:13:40.456 A:middle
you're able to capture and store

00:13:40.546 --> 00:13:43.456 A:middle
twice as many images as you were

00:13:43.456 --> 00:13:45.496 A:middle
able to previously with JPEG.

00:13:47.696 --> 00:13:49.296 A:middle
Let's talk a little bit about

00:13:49.386 --> 00:13:51.986 A:middle
the different formats of HEIF

00:13:51.986 --> 00:13:52.896 A:middle
that we are supporting.

00:13:53.486 --> 00:13:56.346 A:middle
So as I mentioned from an encode

00:13:56.346 --> 00:13:58.076 A:middle
or asset creation perspective,

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:00.496 A:middle
we're going to be using the HEVC

00:14:00.496 --> 00:14:02.706 A:middle
encoder, which means we're going

00:14:02.706 --> 00:14:05.346 A:middle
to be generating the .heic file

00:14:05.346 --> 00:14:06.416 A:middle
extension or .heic.

00:14:06.416 --> 00:14:09.246 A:middle
So that's what we're doing from

00:14:09.296 --> 00:14:10.736 A:middle
asset generation perspective.

00:14:10.736 --> 00:14:12.836 A:middle
So we'll be able to create and

00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:13.906 A:middle
play back those files.

00:14:14.556 --> 00:14:16.586 A:middle
In terms of playback, we're also

00:14:16.586 --> 00:14:19.816 A:middle
going to support decoding H.264

00:14:19.986 --> 00:14:23.846 A:middle
HEIF images and, more generally,

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:25.356 A:middle
if there's another codec that's

00:14:25.356 --> 00:14:26.846 A:middle
supported within our system,

00:14:27.206 --> 00:14:29.106 A:middle
we'll also be able to decode and

00:14:29.106 --> 00:14:31.246 A:middle
display those HEIF files.

00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:38.056 A:middle
There is a great video that one

00:14:38.136 --> 00:14:38.976 A:middle
of our colleagues [inaudible]

00:14:38.976 --> 00:14:41.276 A:middle
has done which will provide more

00:14:41.276 --> 00:14:43.896 A:middle
information into the HEIF file

00:14:43.896 --> 00:14:44.426 A:middle
format.

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:45.456 A:middle
So -- and I think he'll be

00:14:45.456 --> 00:14:47.366 A:middle
posted sometime later today or

00:14:47.366 --> 00:14:47.886 A:middle
tomorrow.

00:14:48.266 --> 00:14:49.976 A:middle
So please be sure to check that

00:14:49.976 --> 00:14:52.026 A:middle
out if you want more details

00:14:52.426 --> 00:14:55.526 A:middle
about the HEIF file format, the

00:14:55.526 --> 00:14:57.056 A:middle
different atom types, and how to

00:14:57.056 --> 00:14:58.986 A:middle
parse the file and process it.

00:15:00.636 --> 00:15:02.026 A:middle
So now that we've talked about

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:03.496 A:middle
these new technologies, what

00:15:03.566 --> 00:15:05.776 A:middle
they are and why we decided to

00:15:05.776 --> 00:15:08.016 A:middle
select them at Apple, we'd like

00:15:08.016 --> 00:15:09.936 A:middle
to talk to you about how we are

00:15:09.936 --> 00:15:11.546 A:middle
using them within the Apple

00:15:11.546 --> 00:15:13.636 A:middle
ecosystem and then also provide

00:15:13.686 --> 00:15:15.856 A:middle
some guidance on what you can do

00:15:15.856 --> 00:15:16.696 A:middle
with these fantastic

00:15:16.696 --> 00:15:18.286 A:middle
technologies in your apps and

00:15:18.286 --> 00:15:18.886 A:middle
use cases.

00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:21.426 A:middle
And to talk you through that,

00:15:21.426 --> 00:15:23.106 A:middle
I'd like to hand things over to

00:15:23.106 --> 00:15:23.806 A:middle
Gavin Thomson.

00:15:24.516 --> 00:15:30.486 A:middle
[ Applause ]

00:15:30.986 --> 00:15:31.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Athar.

00:15:31.866 --> 00:15:33.386 A:middle
So my name is Gavin Thomson.

00:15:33.386 --> 00:15:34.676 A:middle
I'm one of the engineering

00:15:34.756 --> 00:15:36.096 A:middle
managers for the camera and

00:15:36.096 --> 00:15:37.386 A:middle
photo organization at Apple.

00:15:39.656 --> 00:15:46.146 A:middle
OK. So with -- we just learned a

00:15:46.366 --> 00:15:47.726 A:middle
lot of the great benefits of

00:15:47.726 --> 00:15:48.956 A:middle
HEIF and HEVC.

00:15:48.956 --> 00:15:50.446 A:middle
But what are the ecosystem

00:15:50.446 --> 00:15:51.196 A:middle
implications?

00:15:51.866 --> 00:15:53.796 A:middle
So at Apple, we've been working

00:15:53.796 --> 00:15:55.836 A:middle
over the last year to adopt HEIF

00:15:55.836 --> 00:15:57.146 A:middle
and HEVC into the Apple

00:15:57.146 --> 00:15:57.866 A:middle
ecosystem.

00:15:58.256 --> 00:16:01.036 A:middle
So today I would like to share,

00:16:01.106 --> 00:16:02.336 A:middle
talk about that adoption and

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:03.536 A:middle
share the changes that were made

00:16:03.536 --> 00:16:04.966 A:middle
to help with that transition.

00:16:05.996 --> 00:16:07.146 A:middle
Our goal is to make the

00:16:07.146 --> 00:16:08.396 A:middle
introduction of these new

00:16:08.396 --> 00:16:10.056 A:middle
formats as transparent as

00:16:10.096 --> 00:16:10.516 A:middle
possible.

00:16:11.146 --> 00:16:13.146 A:middle
So there are three topics that I

00:16:13.146 --> 00:16:14.326 A:middle
would like to talk about.

00:16:15.526 --> 00:16:17.866 A:middle
First is creation: how and where

00:16:17.866 --> 00:16:19.256 A:middle
we can create HEIF image and

00:16:19.256 --> 00:16:20.266 A:middle
HEVC movie content.

00:16:21.696 --> 00:16:24.396 A:middle
There is access: how and where

00:16:24.396 --> 00:16:26.526 A:middle
to access HEIF and HEVC movie

00:16:26.526 --> 00:16:27.036 A:middle
content.

00:16:27.796 --> 00:16:30.406 A:middle
And finally transfer: so what

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:31.386 A:middle
strategies do you need to

00:16:31.386 --> 00:16:33.106 A:middle
consider when you want to move

00:16:33.106 --> 00:16:34.816 A:middle
HEIF or HEVC content off a

00:16:34.816 --> 00:16:35.976 A:middle
capture or supported device?

00:16:42.046 --> 00:16:43.436 A:middle
So first I'd like to start with

00:16:43.436 --> 00:16:44.006 A:middle
access.

00:16:44.246 --> 00:16:45.956 A:middle
So we've discussed the

00:16:45.956 --> 00:16:47.576 A:middle
extensibility of the HEIF format

00:16:47.576 --> 00:16:48.206 A:middle
for images.

00:16:48.686 --> 00:16:49.176 A:middle
What are some of the

00:16:49.176 --> 00:16:50.536 A:middle
characteristics of the Apple

00:16:50.536 --> 00:16:51.716 A:middle
generated HEIF images?

00:16:53.456 --> 00:16:55.786 A:middle
So as we heard, the file format

00:16:55.786 --> 00:16:57.346 A:middle
is an ISO Based Media format.

00:16:58.046 --> 00:16:59.356 A:middle
So those of you that have look

00:16:59.356 --> 00:17:01.496 A:middle
at the internals of the MP4 or a

00:17:01.496 --> 00:17:03.286 A:middle
QuickTime movie file, be very

00:17:03.286 --> 00:17:04.196 A:middle
familiar with the internal

00:17:04.196 --> 00:17:05.496 A:middle
structure as they're based on

00:17:05.496 --> 00:17:06.336 A:middle
the same standard.

00:17:06.906 --> 00:17:08.236 A:middle
So I want to reiterate here,

00:17:08.536 --> 00:17:10.246 A:middle
HEIF is a container format.

00:17:11.036 --> 00:17:12.206 A:middle
Not too similar to the QuickTime

00:17:12.206 --> 00:17:13.426 A:middle
movie file format.

00:17:14.106 --> 00:17:15.466 A:middle
It's got many more options and a

00:17:15.466 --> 00:17:17.856 A:middle
lot more flexibility than a JPEG

00:17:17.916 --> 00:17:18.646 A:middle
file format.

00:17:20.816 --> 00:17:23.056 A:middle
Now, our image payload is

00:17:23.056 --> 00:17:24.676 A:middle
encoded using HEVC.

00:17:25.376 --> 00:17:26.346 A:middle
And as we've learned, that

00:17:26.346 --> 00:17:27.806 A:middle
provides great compression

00:17:27.806 --> 00:17:29.426 A:middle
improvements over JPEG, up to

00:17:29.426 --> 00:17:29.956 A:middle
2X.

00:17:32.276 --> 00:17:34.446 A:middle
We also encode the image payload

00:17:34.446 --> 00:17:37.286 A:middle
as 512 x 512 tiles.

00:17:37.286 --> 00:17:38.576 A:middle
And amongst other advantages,

00:17:38.576 --> 00:17:40.106 A:middle
that provides great flexibility

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:41.946 A:middle
for fast incremental loading of

00:17:41.946 --> 00:17:45.646 A:middle
high resolution content.

00:17:46.256 --> 00:17:48.436 A:middle
We also have a 320 x 240

00:17:48.436 --> 00:17:50.596 A:middle
embedded thumbnail, which is

00:17:50.666 --> 00:17:52.446 A:middle
four times the resolution but

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:54.436 A:middle
only twice the size of our

00:17:54.436 --> 00:17:57.406 A:middle
current 160 x 120 JPEG embedded

00:17:57.406 --> 00:17:57.966 A:middle
thumbnail.

00:17:58.446 --> 00:17:59.266 A:middle
Why can we do this?

00:17:59.266 --> 00:18:00.666 A:middle
Because the thumbnail was also

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:04.066 A:middle
encoded using HEVC.

00:18:04.776 --> 00:18:07.356 A:middle
We still support an image, EXIF

00:18:07.356 --> 00:18:09.766 A:middle
metadata payload compatible with

00:18:09.826 --> 00:18:10.976 A:middle
the payload that we capture in

00:18:10.976 --> 00:18:11.916 A:middle
our JPEG format.

00:18:15.506 --> 00:18:17.996 A:middle
So HEIF with the HEVC encoded

00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:19.336 A:middle
image will be identified in the

00:18:19.336 --> 00:18:21.486 A:middle
file system with a new extension

00:18:21.816 --> 00:18:24.596 A:middle
.heic or .heic as we call it.

00:18:25.136 --> 00:18:26.636 A:middle
So some will know this is a

00:18:26.636 --> 00:18:29.296 A:middle
breakaway from the DCF 8.3

00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:30.766 A:middle
filenaming convention.

00:18:31.296 --> 00:18:32.496 A:middle
So if you have any assumptions

00:18:32.526 --> 00:18:34.026 A:middle
with your file name parsers, a

00:18:34.026 --> 00:18:34.926 A:middle
variant three character

00:18:34.926 --> 00:18:36.596 A:middle
extension, we now have the

00:18:36.596 --> 00:18:38.426 A:middle
default still capture format

00:18:38.426 --> 00:18:39.486 A:middle
that has four characters.

00:18:43.676 --> 00:18:44.986 A:middle
So where is HEIF decode

00:18:44.986 --> 00:18:45.566 A:middle
supported?

00:18:45.896 --> 00:18:48.016 A:middle
It's supported on all of our --

00:18:48.016 --> 00:18:50.106 A:middle
it's available on all of our

00:18:50.106 --> 00:18:51.816 A:middle
supported platforms that have

00:18:51.816 --> 00:18:54.656 A:middle
macOS 10.3 or iOS 11 installed

00:18:55.166 --> 00:18:55.946 A:middle
but there's a variety of

00:18:55.946 --> 00:18:58.676 A:middle
hardware and software support.

00:18:58.756 --> 00:19:01.026 A:middle
For iOS, we have hardware decode

00:19:01.026 --> 00:19:02.876 A:middle
on the minimum config of the A9

00:19:02.876 --> 00:19:03.156 A:middle
chip.

00:19:03.726 --> 00:19:04.836 A:middle
An example, of which, is the

00:19:04.836 --> 00:19:06.876 A:middle
iPhone 6S or the iPad Pro.

00:19:08.116 --> 00:19:09.656 A:middle
On macOS, we have hardware

00:19:09.656 --> 00:19:10.616 A:middle
decode support on the

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:12.376 A:middle
sixth-generation Intel Core,

00:19:12.376 --> 00:19:13.746 A:middle
which is the Skylake family of

00:19:13.746 --> 00:19:14.456 A:middle
processors.

00:19:15.186 --> 00:19:17.836 A:middle
An example of that machine is

00:19:17.836 --> 00:19:18.696 A:middle
the new MacBook with the

00:19:18.696 --> 00:19:21.396 A:middle
touchbar, but we have software

00:19:21.396 --> 00:19:22.896 A:middle
decode support on all of our

00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:25.196 A:middle
supported iOS and macOS devices.

00:19:28.236 --> 00:19:30.026 A:middle
So where do we have HEIF image

00:19:30.026 --> 00:19:30.546 A:middle
support?

00:19:32.136 --> 00:19:34.446 A:middle
ImageIO was Apple's lowest level

00:19:35.036 --> 00:19:35.896 A:middle
image framework.

00:19:36.066 --> 00:19:37.826 A:middle
And it supports HEIF as a source

00:19:37.826 --> 00:19:40.146 A:middle
for decode, incremental loading,

00:19:40.176 --> 00:19:41.726 A:middle
metadata, and thumbnail

00:19:41.726 --> 00:19:42.376 A:middle
abstraction.

00:19:42.806 --> 00:19:44.156 A:middle
This is in line for their other

00:19:44.156 --> 00:19:46.396 A:middle
supported image formats using

00:19:46.396 --> 00:19:49.886 A:middle
exactly the same APIs.

00:19:50.226 --> 00:19:51.926 A:middle
Core Image also supports HEIF as

00:19:51.926 --> 00:19:53.256 A:middle
a source for real-time image

00:19:53.256 --> 00:19:54.006 A:middle
manipulation.

00:19:56.256 --> 00:19:57.666 A:middle
And the PhotoKit APIs which

00:19:57.666 --> 00:19:59.186 A:middle
allow access to assets in the

00:19:59.186 --> 00:20:00.576 A:middle
photo library also supports

00:20:00.576 --> 00:20:02.256 A:middle
direct access to HEIF, but I'll

00:20:02.256 --> 00:20:03.906 A:middle
talk about this framework in a

00:20:03.906 --> 00:20:05.006 A:middle
little more detail in the coming

00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:05.546 A:middle
slides.

00:20:08.336 --> 00:20:10.206 A:middle
Many of Apple's many based

00:20:10.206 --> 00:20:11.686 A:middle
applications will also natively

00:20:11.686 --> 00:20:12.506 A:middle
work with HEIF.

00:20:12.626 --> 00:20:14.536 A:middle
Notable amongst those is photos,

00:20:14.596 --> 00:20:16.576 A:middle
preview, Quick Look but there

00:20:16.576 --> 00:20:17.436 A:middle
are also many others.

00:20:19.806 --> 00:20:21.246 A:middle
OK. Let's move to our movie

00:20:21.246 --> 00:20:22.496 A:middle
format and talk a little bit

00:20:22.496 --> 00:20:24.626 A:middle
about Apple captured HEVC

00:20:24.716 --> 00:20:25.346 A:middle
movies.

00:20:27.796 --> 00:20:28.906 A:middle
So the changes here aren't as

00:20:28.906 --> 00:20:30.816 A:middle
drastic as our newly supported

00:20:30.816 --> 00:20:31.536 A:middle
image format.

00:20:32.076 --> 00:20:33.526 A:middle
We're still capturing using the

00:20:33.526 --> 00:20:36.446 A:middle
QuickTime file format but with

00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:38.336 A:middle
HEVC coded video frames.

00:20:38.826 --> 00:20:40.116 A:middle
As we've learned for Apple

00:20:40.446 --> 00:20:41.796 A:middle
captured video, we're getting

00:20:41.836 --> 00:20:42.946 A:middle
twice the compression that we're

00:20:42.946 --> 00:20:44.686 A:middle
getting from H.264.

00:20:44.686 --> 00:20:46.346 A:middle
And, once again, just to call

00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:48.126 A:middle
out again, we're using HEVC to

00:20:48.306 --> 00:20:50.096 A:middle
encode both our images and our

00:20:50.096 --> 00:20:50.966 A:middle
video formats.

00:20:55.996 --> 00:20:58.846 A:middle
We also support both an 8- and a

00:20:58.846 --> 00:20:59.826 A:middle
10-bit encoding.

00:21:00.226 --> 00:21:01.626 A:middle
So those of you that really care

00:21:01.626 --> 00:21:03.156 A:middle
about image quality or deep

00:21:03.156 --> 00:21:05.376 A:middle
color, we have a non-real-time,

00:21:05.426 --> 00:21:06.996 A:middle
a 10-bit software encoder on

00:21:06.996 --> 00:21:08.606 A:middle
macOS to satisfy your needs.

00:21:11.786 --> 00:21:13.076 A:middle
You'll be happy to learn, with

00:21:13.176 --> 00:21:14.166 A:middle
this new format, we have

00:21:14.166 --> 00:21:15.776 A:middle
retained the three character

00:21:15.776 --> 00:21:17.476 A:middle
.mov extensions, so you won't

00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:18.576 A:middle
have to update any of your

00:21:18.856 --> 00:21:20.896 A:middle
filename parsers for this media

00:21:23.656 --> 00:21:24.056 A:middle
format.

00:21:24.636 --> 00:21:27.066 A:middle
OK. So where do we have decode

00:21:27.316 --> 00:21:29.636 A:middle
support for HEVC movies?

00:21:29.926 --> 00:21:31.496 A:middle
So we have both 8- and 10-bit

00:21:31.646 --> 00:21:33.606 A:middle
decode which is available on all

00:21:33.606 --> 00:21:34.896 A:middle
our supported platforms with,

00:21:34.896 --> 00:21:37.286 A:middle
once again, macOS 10.13 and iOS

00:21:37.286 --> 00:21:38.996 A:middle
11, but there's a variety of

00:21:38.996 --> 00:21:41.366 A:middle
hardware and software support.

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:43.606 A:middle
So in iOS, we have both 8- and

00:21:43.606 --> 00:21:45.086 A:middle
10-bit hardware decode on the

00:21:45.086 --> 00:21:46.546 A:middle
minimum config of the A9 chip.

00:21:47.396 --> 00:21:49.516 A:middle
Once again, the iPhone 6S is an

00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:50.326 A:middle
example there.

00:21:51.286 --> 00:21:52.816 A:middle
For macOS, we have 8-bit

00:21:52.816 --> 00:21:53.936 A:middle
hardware decode in

00:21:53.936 --> 00:21:55.376 A:middle
sixth-generation Intel Core

00:21:55.376 --> 00:21:56.916 A:middle
processor which is the Skylake

00:21:56.916 --> 00:21:58.066 A:middle
family of processors.

00:21:58.486 --> 00:22:00.346 A:middle
And we have 10-bit hardware

00:22:00.346 --> 00:22:01.696 A:middle
decode support on the

00:22:01.736 --> 00:22:03.326 A:middle
seventh-generation Intel Core

00:22:03.326 --> 00:22:05.046 A:middle
processors or the Kaby Lake

00:22:05.046 --> 00:22:06.276 A:middle
family of processors.

00:22:06.966 --> 00:22:09.176 A:middle
And we have both 8- and 10-bit

00:22:09.176 --> 00:22:10.946 A:middle
software decode across all of

00:22:10.946 --> 00:22:13.756 A:middle
our supported macOS and iOS

00:22:13.796 --> 00:22:14.306 A:middle
platforms.

00:22:18.296 --> 00:22:20.236 A:middle
OK. So where do we support HEVC

00:22:20.236 --> 00:22:21.076 A:middle
movies?

00:22:24.066 --> 00:22:25.946 A:middle
AVFoundation is the primal

00:22:25.946 --> 00:22:27.666 A:middle
framework to manage movies.

00:22:27.886 --> 00:22:29.416 A:middle
And it supports play, create,

00:22:29.416 --> 00:22:30.996 A:middle
and edit workflows for HEVC

00:22:30.996 --> 00:22:31.576 A:middle
content.

00:22:32.086 --> 00:22:35.366 A:middle
Once again, PhotoKit will vend

00:22:35.366 --> 00:22:38.066 A:middle
original HEVC movies.

00:22:38.186 --> 00:22:40.386 A:middle
WebKit will also playback HEVC

00:22:40.386 --> 00:22:43.976 A:middle
movies but only on devices that

00:22:43.976 --> 00:22:45.576 A:middle
have hardware acceleration and

00:22:45.576 --> 00:22:47.746 A:middle
all macOS desktops.

00:22:48.456 --> 00:22:50.426 A:middle
There's also support to

00:22:50.546 --> 00:22:52.706 A:middle
encourage HLS streams using

00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:53.816 A:middle
HEVC.

00:22:54.766 --> 00:22:55.796 A:middle
This represents a great

00:22:55.796 --> 00:22:58.536 A:middle
opportunity to improve network

00:22:59.076 --> 00:22:59.696 A:middle
throughput.

00:23:00.506 --> 00:23:01.706 A:middle
And, in fact, the session

00:23:01.706 --> 00:23:03.026 A:middle
directly after this is going to

00:23:03.026 --> 00:23:05.046 A:middle
talk about this initiative in

00:23:05.046 --> 00:23:06.026 A:middle
much more detail.

00:23:08.336 --> 00:23:10.426 A:middle
Also, we have many Apple

00:23:10.426 --> 00:23:11.656 A:middle
applications that will natively

00:23:11.656 --> 00:23:13.546 A:middle
work with HEVC movies, you know,

00:23:13.546 --> 00:23:14.736 A:middle
QuickTime player, Quick Look

00:23:14.736 --> 00:23:17.096 A:middle
photos but also FaceTime.

00:23:17.256 --> 00:23:19.096 A:middle
This is a great example of HEVC

00:23:19.156 --> 00:23:21.046 A:middle
usage to greatly improve network

00:23:21.046 --> 00:23:21.556 A:middle
throughput.

00:23:22.336 --> 00:23:25.646 A:middle
So we have decode support for

00:23:25.736 --> 00:23:28.536 A:middle
HEVC across all of our devices.

00:23:28.996 --> 00:23:30.036 A:middle
What about playback?

00:23:30.596 --> 00:23:32.176 A:middle
This is where the distinction

00:23:32.176 --> 00:23:33.736 A:middle
between decodable and playable

00:23:33.736 --> 00:23:35.446 A:middle
is very important and

00:23:35.556 --> 00:23:37.486 A:middle
particularly so with HEVC.

00:23:38.176 --> 00:23:40.306 A:middle
This is unfamiliar territory for

00:23:40.306 --> 00:23:41.016 A:middle
many of us.

00:23:41.166 --> 00:23:42.456 A:middle
We don't have hardware

00:23:42.456 --> 00:23:43.996 A:middle
acceleration across all

00:23:43.996 --> 00:23:46.116 A:middle
supported devices for default

00:23:46.116 --> 00:23:46.856 A:middle
capture format.

00:23:47.646 --> 00:23:48.826 A:middle
And this is a problem we haven't

00:23:48.826 --> 00:23:50.436 A:middle
had to deal with for a long time

00:23:50.436 --> 00:23:53.736 A:middle
as H.264 hardware decode is

00:23:53.736 --> 00:23:57.506 A:middle
fairly ubiquitous at this point.

00:23:57.556 --> 00:23:58.946 A:middle
So all of our movie formats are

00:23:58.946 --> 00:24:01.026 A:middle
decodable but on some software

00:24:01.026 --> 00:24:02.466 A:middle
systems, there will be formats

00:24:02.466 --> 00:24:03.346 A:middle
that are much slower than

00:24:03.346 --> 00:24:04.636 A:middle
real-time and really only

00:24:04.636 --> 00:24:06.106 A:middle
supported for export or

00:24:06.106 --> 00:24:07.276 A:middle
transcode workflows.

00:24:07.276 --> 00:24:08.716 A:middle
So how do you make the

00:24:08.716 --> 00:24:11.176 A:middle
determination that a format is

00:24:11.866 --> 00:24:13.396 A:middle
suitable for playback on a given

00:24:13.396 --> 00:24:13.896 A:middle
device?

00:24:15.576 --> 00:24:18.026 A:middle
So AVFoundation, through its

00:24:18.026 --> 00:24:19.646 A:middle
API, supports the notion of

00:24:19.736 --> 00:24:20.466 A:middle
"isPlayable."

00:24:21.246 --> 00:24:22.346 A:middle
And this indicates whether a

00:24:22.346 --> 00:24:24.106 A:middle
device's video level supports

00:24:24.326 --> 00:24:26.136 A:middle
the movie for playback.

00:24:26.946 --> 00:24:28.336 A:middle
If true, you should experience

00:24:28.336 --> 00:24:29.936 A:middle
smooth playback without

00:24:29.936 --> 00:24:31.426 A:middle
incurring any significant power

00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:33.146 A:middle
or [inaudible] cost for videos

00:24:33.146 --> 00:24:34.466 A:middle
of extended durations.

00:24:36.856 --> 00:24:39.416 A:middle
For example, even though Apple

00:24:39.416 --> 00:24:41.236 A:middle
captured 4K30 is decodable

00:24:41.236 --> 00:24:42.296 A:middle
across all of our supported

00:24:42.296 --> 00:24:44.166 A:middle
systems, it's unlikely to be

00:24:44.166 --> 00:24:45.296 A:middle
marked as playable on some of

00:24:45.296 --> 00:24:46.746 A:middle
our older hardware like the

00:24:46.746 --> 00:24:47.606 A:middle
iPhone 5S.

00:24:47.666 --> 00:24:49.226 A:middle
So this is a call out to

00:24:49.226 --> 00:24:49.906 A:middle
developers.

00:24:49.906 --> 00:24:51.306 A:middle
It's really, really important,

00:24:51.306 --> 00:24:52.726 A:middle
at this junction, for you to be

00:24:53.036 --> 00:24:54.656 A:middle
observing these playable state

00:24:55.086 --> 00:24:56.876 A:middle
to ensure we provide the best

00:24:56.876 --> 00:24:58.246 A:middle
possible user experience.

00:25:01.936 --> 00:25:04.276 A:middle
OK. For many developers, their

00:25:04.276 --> 00:25:05.686 A:middle
first interaction with original

00:25:05.686 --> 00:25:07.366 A:middle
HEIF and HEVC content will be

00:25:07.366 --> 00:25:09.376 A:middle
through one of the public photo

00:25:10.196 --> 00:25:10.346 A:middle
APIs.

00:25:11.576 --> 00:25:13.466 A:middle
PhotoKit is the widely used

00:25:13.466 --> 00:25:14.956 A:middle
photos API on iOS.

00:25:15.666 --> 00:25:16.726 A:middle
And during his conference,

00:25:16.726 --> 00:25:17.756 A:middle
they'll be some announcements

00:25:17.756 --> 00:25:19.896 A:middle
about its availability on macOS.

00:25:19.896 --> 00:25:21.866 A:middle
So look to the what's new photo

00:25:21.866 --> 00:25:22.866 A:middle
session tomorrow for more

00:25:22.866 --> 00:25:24.826 A:middle
details on that, but it will

00:25:24.826 --> 00:25:26.796 A:middle
vend original HEIF and HEVC

00:25:27.496 --> 00:25:28.546 A:middle
movie content.

00:25:28.886 --> 00:25:30.226 A:middle
Also, the deprecated

00:25:30.276 --> 00:25:31.966 A:middle
AssetLibrary framework is still

00:25:31.966 --> 00:25:33.836 A:middle
very popular in the development

00:25:33.836 --> 00:25:34.226 A:middle
community.

00:25:34.226 --> 00:25:36.946 A:middle
And it will also vend HEIF and

00:25:37.866 --> 00:25:39.536 A:middle
HEVC content.

00:25:40.116 --> 00:25:41.586 A:middle
On macOS, there is also the

00:25:41.586 --> 00:25:42.626 A:middle
Media Library API.

00:25:43.286 --> 00:25:45.406 A:middle
For this release, it will only

00:25:45.406 --> 00:25:46.616 A:middle
be vending transcoded

00:25:46.616 --> 00:25:48.556 A:middle
representations of HEIF and HEVC

00:25:48.556 --> 00:25:51.366 A:middle
as JPEG and H.264 have been an

00:25:51.366 --> 00:25:52.406 A:middle
equivalent resolution.

00:25:55.796 --> 00:25:56.886 A:middle
Because of the popularity of

00:25:56.886 --> 00:25:58.386 A:middle
PhotoKit to access media on

00:25:58.386 --> 00:25:59.766 A:middle
Apple platforms, I wanted to

00:25:59.766 --> 00:26:01.116 A:middle
highlight some of the classes

00:26:01.496 --> 00:26:02.606 A:middle
through which you can access

00:26:02.606 --> 00:26:04.276 A:middle
HEIF and HEVC content.

00:26:05.916 --> 00:26:07.986 A:middle
When requesting images, you use

00:26:07.986 --> 00:26:09.066 A:middle
the PHImageManager.

00:26:09.766 --> 00:26:11.136 A:middle
Through this class, you can

00:26:11.136 --> 00:26:13.136 A:middle
request original HEIF images.

00:26:14.056 --> 00:26:15.216 A:middle
Also, remember requesting video

00:26:15.216 --> 00:26:17.166 A:middle
objects, you can also use the

00:26:17.166 --> 00:26:19.506 A:middle
PHImageManager to request HEVC

00:26:19.506 --> 00:26:20.396 A:middle
movies.

00:26:22.176 --> 00:26:25.676 A:middle
For managing resources, we have

00:26:25.676 --> 00:26:28.126 A:middle
the PHAssetResourceManager which

00:26:28.126 --> 00:26:29.696 A:middle
allows you to manage all the

00:26:29.696 --> 00:26:31.006 A:middle
discrete resources in the photo

00:26:31.006 --> 00:26:31.496 A:middle
library.

00:26:31.776 --> 00:26:33.296 A:middle
Amongst those could be HEIF and

00:26:33.296 --> 00:26:34.246 A:middle
HEVC content.

00:26:37.416 --> 00:26:39.026 A:middle
And for edit workflows, we have

00:26:39.026 --> 00:26:41.066 A:middle
the PHContentEditinginput.

00:26:41.066 --> 00:26:43.226 A:middle
And it will support HEIF image

00:26:43.276 --> 00:26:45.466 A:middle
or HEVC movies as input to an

00:26:45.466 --> 00:26:46.146 A:middle
edit session.

00:26:46.726 --> 00:26:50.716 A:middle
So a point that I really want to

00:26:50.716 --> 00:26:51.966 A:middle
stress here is that if you're

00:26:51.966 --> 00:26:53.386 A:middle
already using Apple frameworks

00:26:53.416 --> 00:26:55.326 A:middle
to manage media, the transition

00:26:55.326 --> 00:26:57.256 A:middle
to HEIF or HEVC should be

00:26:57.256 --> 00:26:58.266 A:middle
transparent.

00:26:58.656 --> 00:26:59.956 A:middle
On the other hand, if you

00:26:59.956 --> 00:27:01.596 A:middle
[inaudible] image or video

00:27:01.596 --> 00:27:03.686 A:middle
stack, you might need to revisit

00:27:03.686 --> 00:27:05.426 A:middle
that integration and possibly

00:27:05.426 --> 00:27:06.626 A:middle
consider adopting one of the

00:27:06.626 --> 00:27:08.356 A:middle
appropriate Apple frameworks.

00:27:08.986 --> 00:27:11.466 A:middle
Amongst those are ImageIO for

00:27:11.466 --> 00:27:14.376 A:middle
images, AVFoundation for videos,

00:27:15.786 --> 00:27:18.206 A:middle
Core Image for video frame or

00:27:18.366 --> 00:27:19.386 A:middle
image manipulation.

00:27:20.396 --> 00:27:22.366 A:middle
We have UIKit for presentation.

00:27:24.236 --> 00:27:26.556 A:middle
We have PhotoKit to access the

00:27:26.556 --> 00:27:27.746 A:middle
resources within the photo

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:28.236 A:middle
library.

00:27:29.086 --> 00:27:30.776 A:middle
So usage of HEIF and HEVC

00:27:30.776 --> 00:27:32.466 A:middle
through these frameworks will be

00:27:32.466 --> 00:27:33.176 A:middle
transparent.

00:27:35.546 --> 00:27:36.896 A:middle
I'm going to make a second call

00:27:36.896 --> 00:27:38.166 A:middle
out to the session that we have

00:27:38.246 --> 00:27:40.236 A:middle
Friday at 11:00 a.m. working

00:27:40.236 --> 00:27:41.116 A:middle
with HEIF and HEVC.

00:27:41.206 --> 00:27:42.996 A:middle
There are lots of great code

00:27:42.996 --> 00:27:45.226 A:middle
examples of using HEIF and HEVC

00:27:45.326 --> 00:27:46.996 A:middle
with these frameworks.

00:27:47.606 --> 00:27:49.166 A:middle
I highly recommend it.

00:27:50.446 --> 00:27:52.546 A:middle
OK. That was access.

00:27:52.796 --> 00:27:54.256 A:middle
Let's move on to creation.

00:27:55.406 --> 00:27:57.646 A:middle
So where and how can we create

00:27:57.646 --> 00:27:59.546 A:middle
HEIF image and HEVC movie

00:27:59.546 --> 00:28:00.076 A:middle
content?

00:28:01.356 --> 00:28:03.236 A:middle
So, as you can see, we currently

00:28:03.236 --> 00:28:05.586 A:middle
only have HEIF encode support

00:28:05.586 --> 00:28:08.096 A:middle
and hardware on iOS with minimum

00:28:08.096 --> 00:28:09.556 A:middle
configuration being the A10

00:28:09.556 --> 00:28:11.316 A:middle
Fusion chip, an example, of

00:28:11.316 --> 00:28:13.026 A:middle
which, is the iPhone 7 and the

00:28:13.026 --> 00:28:13.956 A:middle
iPhone 7 Plus.

00:28:14.516 --> 00:28:15.816 A:middle
So the notable exception at this

00:28:15.816 --> 00:28:17.256 A:middle
point in time is HEIF encode

00:28:17.256 --> 00:28:21.036 A:middle
support on macOS.

00:28:21.636 --> 00:28:23.856 A:middle
How do we create HEIF images?

00:28:24.766 --> 00:28:26.726 A:middle
ImageIO supports HEIF as a

00:28:26.726 --> 00:28:27.476 A:middle
destination.

00:28:28.046 --> 00:28:28.816 A:middle
So you could consider

00:28:28.816 --> 00:28:31.456 A:middle
transcoding your JPEG resources

00:28:31.456 --> 00:28:33.546 A:middle
to HEIF for great storage or

00:28:33.666 --> 00:28:34.726 A:middle
network benefits.

00:28:35.206 --> 00:28:38.596 A:middle
Also, the AVFoundation capture

00:28:38.596 --> 00:28:40.616 A:middle
APIs will support HEIF captured

00:28:40.616 --> 00:28:43.906 A:middle
directly from the camera.

00:28:44.846 --> 00:28:47.516 A:middle
As Athar said, so all the Apple

00:28:47.516 --> 00:28:48.786 A:middle
camera modes will default to

00:28:48.786 --> 00:28:50.146 A:middle
HEIF with the bursts being the

00:28:50.146 --> 00:28:51.026 A:middle
only exception.

00:28:51.346 --> 00:28:52.306 A:middle
So if you have installed the

00:28:52.366 --> 00:28:53.746 A:middle
seed builds on supported

00:28:53.746 --> 00:28:55.136 A:middle
hardware and you're taking

00:28:55.136 --> 00:28:57.576 A:middle
photos, you're capturing them in

00:28:57.576 --> 00:28:58.306 A:middle
the HEIF format.

00:28:59.746 --> 00:29:01.576 A:middle
It's also worth reemphasizing

00:29:01.776 --> 00:29:03.506 A:middle
that only the HEIC variation of

00:29:03.506 --> 00:29:05.126 A:middle
HEIF is supported from code

00:29:05.126 --> 00:29:06.146 A:middle
through Apple frameworks.

00:29:06.586 --> 00:29:08.116 A:middle
So HEIF images with the .hvc

00:29:08.206 --> 00:29:09.436 A:middle
encoded image.

00:29:09.986 --> 00:29:14.206 A:middle
Let's move to movie creation.

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:16.316 A:middle
Here are at the table showing

00:29:16.556 --> 00:29:18.116 A:middle
where we have HEVC encode

00:29:18.116 --> 00:29:18.586 A:middle
support.

00:29:19.466 --> 00:29:21.276 A:middle
So in iOS, we have 8-bit encode

00:29:21.276 --> 00:29:22.876 A:middle
support with minimum

00:29:22.876 --> 00:29:24.626 A:middle
configuration of the A10 Fusion

00:29:24.626 --> 00:29:26.296 A:middle
chip, the iPhone 7 for example.

00:29:27.076 --> 00:29:29.316 A:middle
On macOS, we have 8-bit hardware

00:29:29.316 --> 00:29:30.816 A:middle
encode on the sixth-generation

00:29:30.816 --> 00:29:32.146 A:middle
Intel Core processor or the

00:29:32.146 --> 00:29:33.786 A:middle
Skylake family of processors.

00:29:34.706 --> 00:29:36.776 A:middle
And also on macOS in software we

00:29:36.776 --> 00:29:39.086 A:middle
have a 10-bit encode support.

00:29:39.916 --> 00:29:42.226 A:middle
How do we create HEVC movies?

00:29:43.756 --> 00:29:45.686 A:middle
So AVFoundation is a framework

00:29:45.686 --> 00:29:46.816 A:middle
for movie creation.

00:29:47.286 --> 00:29:49.016 A:middle
And HEVC movies can be created

00:29:49.016 --> 00:29:50.596 A:middle
through an AVFoundation export

00:29:50.596 --> 00:29:51.036 A:middle
session.

00:29:51.566 --> 00:29:55.536 A:middle
So you could export H.264 to

00:29:55.536 --> 00:29:56.676 A:middle
HEVC for great storage or

00:29:56.676 --> 00:29:57.866 A:middle
network optimizations.

00:29:58.496 --> 00:30:01.666 A:middle
You can also capture HEIF movies

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:03.056 A:middle
directly through an AVFoundation

00:30:03.056 --> 00:30:06.776 A:middle
capture session with a camera.

00:30:07.066 --> 00:30:08.746 A:middle
Also, all the current movie

00:30:08.746 --> 00:30:10.766 A:middle
camera modes will default to

00:30:10.766 --> 00:30:12.456 A:middle
HEVC encoded movies.

00:30:12.456 --> 00:30:13.996 A:middle
So, once again, if you've

00:30:13.996 --> 00:30:15.846 A:middle
installed the seed builds and

00:30:15.846 --> 00:30:18.456 A:middle
you're taking movies, you're

00:30:18.456 --> 00:30:22.856 A:middle
capturing them as HEVC movies.

00:30:23.336 --> 00:30:24.246 A:middle
That was creation.

00:30:24.926 --> 00:30:26.486 A:middle
Next we come to transfer.

00:30:27.536 --> 00:30:29.256 A:middle
So what questions should we be

00:30:29.256 --> 00:30:30.186 A:middle
considering when we want to

00:30:30.186 --> 00:30:31.846 A:middle
transfer HEIF image of HEVC

00:30:31.846 --> 00:30:35.636 A:middle
movies from a creation device or

00:30:35.636 --> 00:30:36.996 A:middle
other supported devices?

00:30:39.556 --> 00:30:41.366 A:middle
When transferring HEIF or HEVC

00:30:41.366 --> 00:30:43.136 A:middle
off a supported device, you

00:30:43.136 --> 00:30:44.456 A:middle
don't have the same ecosystem to

00:30:44.456 --> 00:30:46.656 A:middle
code support that JPEG or H.264

00:30:46.656 --> 00:30:47.196 A:middle
provides.

00:30:47.806 --> 00:30:48.616 A:middle
You might want to consider

00:30:48.616 --> 00:30:49.426 A:middle
transcoding.

00:30:50.776 --> 00:30:52.336 A:middle
There are a few approaches you

00:30:52.336 --> 00:30:53.096 A:middle
might want to consider.

00:30:53.626 --> 00:30:55.346 A:middle
The first and the simplest would

00:30:55.346 --> 00:30:56.916 A:middle
be to always transcode.

00:30:58.056 --> 00:30:59.806 A:middle
Another option might be to

00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:02.036 A:middle
support a capabilities exchange.

00:31:02.566 --> 00:31:05.766 A:middle
Let's start with looking at an

00:31:05.766 --> 00:31:07.226 A:middle
example for workflow where you

00:31:07.226 --> 00:31:08.476 A:middle
might always transcode.

00:31:10.816 --> 00:31:12.466 A:middle
In this example, you have your

00:31:12.466 --> 00:31:13.806 A:middle
own social networking client

00:31:13.926 --> 00:31:15.806 A:middle
that allows users to add HEIF or

00:31:15.806 --> 00:31:17.966 A:middle
HEVC content to a timeline.

00:31:19.336 --> 00:31:21.076 A:middle
So with this architecture, there

00:31:21.076 --> 00:31:22.266 A:middle
is really no opportunity to

00:31:22.266 --> 00:31:24.106 A:middle
evaluate the capabilities of all

00:31:24.106 --> 00:31:25.786 A:middle
the receiving devices and

00:31:25.786 --> 00:31:27.266 A:middle
possibly no server transcode

00:31:27.266 --> 00:31:27.716 A:middle
support.

00:31:29.016 --> 00:31:31.306 A:middle
So the option here is to always

00:31:31.306 --> 00:31:32.016 A:middle
transcode.

00:31:32.566 --> 00:31:37.326 A:middle
So for this scenario, both

00:31:37.526 --> 00:31:38.986 A:middle
supported and unsupported

00:31:38.986 --> 00:31:40.366 A:middle
devices would receive the

00:31:40.366 --> 00:31:42.226 A:middle
transcoded representation, for

00:31:42.226 --> 00:31:47.426 A:middle
example a JPEG or H.264.

00:31:47.426 --> 00:31:48.856 A:middle
Another approach that we might

00:31:48.856 --> 00:31:49.666 A:middle
want to consider is a

00:31:49.666 --> 00:31:51.106 A:middle
capabilities exchange.

00:31:52.046 --> 00:31:53.496 A:middle
Let's take a look at an example

00:31:53.546 --> 00:31:54.386 A:middle
of that workflow.

00:31:55.776 --> 00:31:56.866 A:middle
So here you might have a

00:31:57.426 --> 00:31:58.696 A:middle
application that is adopted,

00:31:58.696 --> 00:32:00.366 A:middle
Apple's Multipeer Connectivity

00:32:00.366 --> 00:32:00.796 A:middle
APIs.

00:32:01.696 --> 00:32:03.246 A:middle
If you're exchanging media with

00:32:03.246 --> 00:32:04.986 A:middle
a supported device, you don't

00:32:04.986 --> 00:32:06.476 A:middle
want to incur the cost of

00:32:06.476 --> 00:32:07.966 A:middle
transcode and high network

00:32:07.966 --> 00:32:09.526 A:middle
latency of always sending a

00:32:09.526 --> 00:32:11.826 A:middle
transcoded JPEG or H.264.

00:32:12.356 --> 00:32:15.086 A:middle
So you could introduce your

00:32:15.086 --> 00:32:16.496 A:middle
capabilities exchange in the

00:32:16.496 --> 00:32:17.436 A:middle
initial handshake.

00:32:19.716 --> 00:32:21.736 A:middle
The sending device would

00:32:21.736 --> 00:32:23.336 A:middle
evaluate the capabilities of the

00:32:23.336 --> 00:32:24.976 A:middle
receiving device and decide

00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:26.276 A:middle
whether to transcode or not.

00:32:27.046 --> 00:32:29.196 A:middle
So the hope, over time, is that

00:32:29.196 --> 00:32:30.576 A:middle
as the support for these formats

00:32:30.746 --> 00:32:34.776 A:middle
grows, the amount of times that

00:32:34.776 --> 00:32:36.566 A:middle
we need to transcode decreases.

00:32:37.426 --> 00:32:38.916 A:middle
So this strategy is really

00:32:38.916 --> 00:32:40.646 A:middle
suitable for both P2P and in

00:32:40.646 --> 00:32:42.026 A:middle
client/server architectures.

00:32:44.676 --> 00:32:46.566 A:middle
So how is Apple handling many

00:32:46.566 --> 00:32:47.606 A:middle
similar workflows?

00:32:47.996 --> 00:32:51.616 A:middle
Here are a couple of examples.

00:32:51.876 --> 00:32:53.406 A:middle
So it's mail.

00:32:53.486 --> 00:32:54.796 A:middle
It's not really possible to

00:32:54.796 --> 00:32:56.306 A:middle
evaluate the capabilities of all

00:32:56.306 --> 00:32:57.286 A:middle
the receiving clients.

00:32:57.286 --> 00:32:58.536 A:middle
And we don't have server

00:32:58.536 --> 00:33:00.646 A:middle
transcode support so before

00:33:00.646 --> 00:33:03.746 A:middle
sending HEIF or HEVC as a mail

00:33:03.816 --> 00:33:06.026 A:middle
attachment, we always transcode.

00:33:06.576 --> 00:33:08.956 A:middle
Now for those developers that

00:33:08.956 --> 00:33:11.066 A:middle
have share extensions, we'll

00:33:11.066 --> 00:33:14.016 A:middle
also transcode before handing

00:33:14.016 --> 00:33:16.556 A:middle
off a HEIF or HEVC.

00:33:16.686 --> 00:33:18.646 A:middle
This simplifies that integration

00:33:18.716 --> 00:33:20.576 A:middle
for the time being anyway.

00:33:22.796 --> 00:33:24.566 A:middle
We've also adopted the

00:33:24.566 --> 00:33:25.686 A:middle
capabilities exchange for a

00:33:25.686 --> 00:33:26.696 A:middle
number of workflows.

00:33:26.996 --> 00:33:29.466 A:middle
Example of those, P2P and

00:33:29.466 --> 00:33:29.896 A:middle
AirDrop.

00:33:30.596 --> 00:33:33.166 A:middle
So with these integrations, we

00:33:33.166 --> 00:33:34.996 A:middle
always evaluate the capabilities

00:33:34.996 --> 00:33:37.306 A:middle
of the receiver before deciding

00:33:37.406 --> 00:33:39.546 A:middle
whether to transcode or not.

00:33:42.976 --> 00:33:44.816 A:middle
So in summary, there are a few

00:33:44.816 --> 00:33:46.736 A:middle
points with regards to HEIF and

00:33:46.786 --> 00:33:48.136 A:middle
HEVC that I'd really like to

00:33:48.806 --> 00:33:48.966 A:middle
highlight.

00:33:50.256 --> 00:33:52.616 A:middle
HEVC is Apple's next-generation

00:33:52.616 --> 00:33:54.306 A:middle
codec, which we're going to use

00:33:54.576 --> 00:33:56.776 A:middle
for both encoding images and

00:33:56.776 --> 00:33:58.506 A:middle
videos and is providing up to

00:33:58.506 --> 00:33:59.606 A:middle
two times the compression

00:33:59.606 --> 00:34:00.856 A:middle
improvement for Apple captured

00:34:00.856 --> 00:34:01.376 A:middle
content.

00:34:01.896 --> 00:34:05.796 A:middle
We're adopting HEIF as our image

00:34:05.796 --> 00:34:06.556 A:middle
file format.

00:34:07.766 --> 00:34:09.296 A:middle
This image container provides us

00:34:09.296 --> 00:34:10.916 A:middle
with a flexible format which we

00:34:10.916 --> 00:34:14.256 A:middle
can use well into the future.

00:34:14.826 --> 00:34:16.696 A:middle
If you're using Apple frameworks

00:34:16.696 --> 00:34:18.726 A:middle
within the Apple ecosystem, the

00:34:18.726 --> 00:34:20.966 A:middle
transition to HEIF and HEVC

00:34:20.966 --> 00:34:22.296 A:middle
should be mostly transparent.

00:34:22.956 --> 00:34:23.856 A:middle
But if you need to move that

00:34:23.856 --> 00:34:25.016 A:middle
content outside of that

00:34:25.016 --> 00:34:26.666 A:middle
ecosystem, you should consider

00:34:27.136 --> 00:34:28.806 A:middle
your transcoding options to

00:34:28.806 --> 00:34:30.646 A:middle
provide the best backwards

00:34:30.986 --> 00:34:34.976 A:middle
compatibility for our users.

00:34:35.096 --> 00:34:36.886 A:middle
And finally, we really want

00:34:36.886 --> 00:34:39.836 A:middle
developers to embrace HEIF and

00:34:39.836 --> 00:34:42.016 A:middle
HEVC for creation and access

00:34:42.076 --> 00:34:43.966 A:middle
workflows as we believe this

00:34:43.966 --> 00:34:45.566 A:middle
will provide great benefits to

00:34:45.566 --> 00:34:47.276 A:middle
not only developers but all of

00:34:47.276 --> 00:34:48.106 A:middle
our customers.

00:34:48.756 --> 00:34:50.656 A:middle
So for more details on this

00:34:50.656 --> 00:34:51.826 A:middle
particular session, you can go

00:34:51.826 --> 00:34:58.376 A:middle
to the following website, but we

00:34:58.376 --> 00:35:00.756 A:middle
also have a number of sessions

00:35:00.756 --> 00:35:01.166 A:middle
and labs.

00:35:01.306 --> 00:35:02.856 A:middle
We can learn more about HEIF and

00:35:02.926 --> 00:35:03.216 A:middle
HEVC.

00:35:03.586 --> 00:35:04.576 A:middle
Just a few to highlight.

00:35:05.396 --> 00:35:06.586 A:middle
The session following this is

00:35:06.586 --> 00:35:09.006 A:middle
advances in HTTP Live Streaming.

00:35:11.936 --> 00:35:13.826 A:middle
