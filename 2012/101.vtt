00:00:10.372 --> 00:00:10.373
Hello everybody and welcome to WWDC 2012.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660
I'm very happy to be here and see you all here.

00:00:18.137 --> 00:00:19.551
It's a big room.

00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:23.936
So, I hope you like what you saw this morning

00:00:23.936 --> 00:00:26.284
in the Keynote, there were lots of new announcements

00:00:26.284 --> 00:00:28.166
lots of new hardware.

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:31.510
The new MacBook Pro,wow!

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.464
A great machine

00:00:33.464 --> 00:00:41.510
We also announced a lot of new features in OSX

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.943
There was xxx new feature in OSX

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:46.634
And I'm not going to go through it again this afternoon

00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:52.369
But a lot of new features in Mountain Lion, the new OSX

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:55.779
Same thing with iOS, a lot of new features

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:57.646
I think like 200 new features

00:00:57.646 --> 00:01:01.773
And here again, I'm not going to go through all the features

00:01:01.773 --> 00:01:03.878
Those are very great announcements

00:01:03.878 --> 00:01:07.286
and I'm sure you're going to love those 2 OS's

00:01:07.286 --> 00:01:08.767
So for you developers,

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:12.347
and I went through last time xxx one by one

00:01:12.347 --> 00:01:15.551
And there were more than 3000 new APIs

00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:17.294
I stopped at 3000

00:01:17.294 --> 00:01:22.730
But there is like 3000 new APIs for you to discover

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.531
That is what this week is about

00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:26.800
To dive into those new APIs

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.426
and learn, and see what you can use for your new product

00:01:31.426 --> 00:01:36.592
Or when you update your current application

00:01:36.592 --> 00:01:44.650
So with iOS and OSX, we have 2 huge ecosystems

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.370
Ecosystems built on top of the 2 leading platforms in the industry

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.937
At Apple, we care about the complete experience from end to end

00:01:54.937 --> 00:01:58.763
So we care about the hardware, the software, the services

00:01:58.763 --> 00:02:01.655
The content, and even the accessories

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:08.484
We want the user to experience the full experience from end to end

00:02:08.484 --> 00:02:11.356
You developers are also part in this ecosystem

00:02:11.356 --> 00:02:13.674
You're taking advantage of this huge ecosystem

00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:17.727
to be able to sell your application to lots of customers

00:02:17.727 --> 00:02:20.864
And so you are improving our ecosystem

00:02:20.864 --> 00:02:26.115
and you are helping us to be so successful.

00:02:26.115 --> 00:02:29.323
Some numbers were shown this morning

00:02:29.323 --> 00:02:32.717
650,000 apps -- that's huge

00:02:32.717 --> 00:02:35.768
I've been at Apple for more than 20 years

00:02:35.768 --> 00:02:39.183
and believe me, this is huge

00:02:39.183 --> 00:02:44.295
30 billion downloads -- that's also a humongous number

00:02:44.295 --> 00:02:48.568
And 400 million Store Accounts

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:53.680
That's 400 million potential customers for your application

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.288
So a lot of customers

00:02:56.288 --> 00:02:58.688
So, what you're going to do this afternoon

00:02:58.688 --> 00:03:01.163
is step back a little bit

00:03:01.163 --> 00:03:04.263
We want to give you 10 actual items

00:03:04.263 --> 00:03:07.301
10 things that you should be doing in your next application

00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:10.555
or when you upgrade your current application

00:03:10.555 --> 00:03:13.102
10 things that we really care about

00:03:13.102 --> 00:03:14.760
because we are spending a lot of resources,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.922
a lot of time, a lot of effort on

00:03:16.922 --> 00:03:21.135
And our customers want those things to be in your application

00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:24.799
So we're going to go through those 10 action items

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.516
Take notes, there's going to be a quiz at the end

00:03:28.516 --> 00:03:31.878
So let's start

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:35.599
Number 1: Design

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.399
So design is something we deeply care about here at Apple

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:42.509
In our hardware, in our software

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:44.385
Design is part of our DNA

00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:47.507
We spend a lot of time designing our applications

00:03:47.507 --> 00:03:48.972
designing our hardware

00:03:48.972 --> 00:03:51.880
This is what we are all about

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.935
So for you developers, how does it start?

00:03:53.935 --> 00:03:55.289
It starts with this big idea

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.664
"Oh my God, this big idea is going to be fantastic"

00:03:57.664 --> 00:04:02.539
and -<i>woof</i>- you go and start typing code and writing code

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:05.843
And there is a big missing step here

00:04:05.843 --> 00:04:10.842
You have to look at the design of your application

00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:12.429
There is a famous quote that says

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:16.955
"Genius is 1% inspiration, and 99% perspiration"

00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:19.629
For you, the idea is really the 1% here

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:21.354
The rest is how you're going to deliver

00:04:21.354 --> 00:04:22.955
your idea to your customers

00:04:22.955 --> 00:04:25.760
This is what's important

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.439
So, design -- what is this about?

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.912
We can define 3 types of design

00:04:31.912 --> 00:04:33.705
There is the Interaction design

00:04:33.705 --> 00:04:35.328
The Implementation design

00:04:35.328 --> 00:04:37.140
and the Visual design

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.765
And they are not 3 steps that you can do 1, 2, 3 and you're done

00:04:39.765 --> 00:04:41.593
and move on

00:04:41.593 --> 00:04:45.521
They all -- this is something that's going to evolve during the lifetime

00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:47.485
during your development cycle

00:04:47.485 --> 00:04:51.485
And they are all interacting with each other

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Your change in interaction design is going to change your implementation obviously, and it may change your visual.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So they are all working dependent on each other, and you have to constantly make them evolve.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Let's describe briefly what I mean here.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
The interaction design is all about shaping your application for people use.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
It means making it efficient, engaging, intuitive.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
If you know the expression "Look and feel" - it's about the "feel" in "look and feel".

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You don't want your user to have to read a 300 pages manual.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
It's obvious, but ????????

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
We have great documentation at Apple with User Interface Guidelines - one for OS X and one for iOS.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Because the interaction is obviously not exactly the same.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So, read these documents. It's a most mandatory for you to read these documents.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Spend time understanding how you can implement the best interaction possible.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
The single(?) type of design certain aspect of design is the implementation design.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And here I'm sure there are a lot of engineers in this room today. This is probably where you're gonna be spending most of your time.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
This is about finding the right technology for your idea, the right architecture and the feature set.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Looking at performance, plan for your resources - the people, the time.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
All those things that are key to be successful.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
It's also the time to make the right trade-offs.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You may have this grandiose idea, but it turns out that, you know, the technology is not there, or you don't have time to do it so.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
This is the time to figure out, what you can do in the time you have to go to market.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Finally, the visual design. This is about making your application beautiful and unique.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Giving the perfect experience to your customers.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
This is about choosing the visual elements that are going to make your application unique.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
The right typography, the right colour, the right patterns.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Everything that's going to make a memorable experience.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So, may sound obvious but you need to think about these things.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And figure out if you are going through this whole cycle for your application.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Skipping (?) on design - you wan't get what you want at the end.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You may have this great idea - but you wan't have any success.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So this is about design. Your first action item - don't skip on design.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
The number two action item is about iCloud.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So iCloud is Apple cloud service. The idea is very simple.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
We want our customer to have all their documents, all their stuff up in the cloud.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And they can access it wirelessly anywhere on any devices.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
That's the goal of iCloud.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
iCloud was introduced last year. It's integrated in OS X and iOS. It's a free service.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And it's simple and easy for our users to use.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
As I said we are integrating iCloud in all our applications and services.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
On iOS it is in Mail, Calendar, Address book. It's in Backup.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
It's in the store, in the music store. We announced the new share photo stream.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
It's in the iMessage. So we are including iCloud everywhere.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And on both iOS and OS X.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
As of March of 2012 we had 125 Million iCloud users.
