00:00:08.726 --> 00:00:12.537
Good morning everyone.

00:00:12.537 --> 00:00:15.104
Thank you for coming.

00:00:15.104 --> 00:00:17.840
So. This is session 212. Basics + Habits.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.285
Building your software projects to last.

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:26.484
I am Ken Kocienda and again, thank you for coming.

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:30.680
So, I think, right, when you think about building a

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.404
great project, I mean, it means for us,

00:00:32.404 --> 00:00:35.692
for this audience, it means building a great application.

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:37.165
Right? That's why you're at WWDC.

00:00:37.165 --> 00:00:42.748
You're an app developer and you want to make great apps.

00:00:42.748 --> 00:00:45.476
And if you are successful in making an app

00:00:45.476 --> 00:00:47.336
it means that your app is probably going

00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:49.664
to change. You're gonna be shipping updates

00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:52.890
to app as new features, new OS releases

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.672
come out

00:00:53.672 --> 00:00:56.760
There gonna be bugfixes, updates, you know,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.969
all of these kinds of things.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.504
So success means, your software is going to change.

00:01:02.504 --> 00:01:03.520
And you probably know that

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.104
radical changes rarely work.

00:01:05.104 --> 00:01:08.120
If you take the example from biology

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.604
there only in evolution, most mutations

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:12.377
kill the organism right, you have

00:01:12.377 --> 00:01:15.397
a radical change, it doesn't work.

00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:18.692
The same holds true for software

00:01:18.692 --> 00:01:21.472
So, incremental change is better.

00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:23.220
Last year, how many of you saw

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.370
my "Easy-to-change code" talk,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.365
last year perhaps?

00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:27.327
Oh, there are a couple of hands...

00:01:27.327 --> 00:01:28.965
Security, those are the people.

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:30.229
You probably wanna leave.

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.185
They're crazy enough to come to my

00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:32.545
talk to years in a row.

00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:35.785
But no, thank you, thank you for coming again.

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:37.608
But for those of you who weren't here

00:01:37.608 --> 00:01:40.288
last year with the easy-to-change code talk,

00:01:40.288 --> 00:01:45.288
I talked about this mental change idea last year,

00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:49.448
but in getting some of your feedback

00:01:49.448 --> 00:01:52.296
I realized there were some problems with some

00:01:52.296 --> 00:01:54.201
of the things that I said.

00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:58.152
Like: I talked about notifications.

00:01:58.152 --> 00:02:00.705
I said in one part of the talk: "Notifications are

00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:03.317
good, because the promoto loose coupling.

00:02:03.317 --> 00:02:06.349
between different parts of your system and

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:07.684
that's a good thing.

00:02:07.684 --> 00:02:10.325
But in another part of the talk I said, half jokingly

00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:14.476
that notifications are bad, because they're just

00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:16.532
glorified GOTOstatements. So kind of

00:02:16.532 --> 00:02:19.685
seems that both of these can't be right.

00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:21.925
But hang on, there's more, right?

00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:24.929
I also talked in my session about hygiene, alright?

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:28.500
The best writing is rewriting, quoting there

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.128
E.B. White, a great writer. But then also said

00:02:32.128 --> 00:02:34.986
don't trhow away old code, right? You just want to

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:38.472
incrementally change software to sort of bring new

00:02:38.472 --> 00:02:40.833
features to it or change it, and this kind of seems again

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:44.824
both of those cant be right. It's paradox

00:02:44.824 --> 00:02:46.484
you wind up with this: Too many cooks

00:02:46.484 --> 00:02:48.509
spoil the broth, but many hands make

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:49.645
light work.

00:02:49.645 --> 00:02:52.628
Right? Again: Things don't seem to make sense

00:02:52.628 --> 00:02:56.360
when you say them both at the same time.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.621
But, of course, they do I think in all of these

00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:02.840
cases, if you say one of these things in the right

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.804
context, right?

00:03:03.804 --> 00:03:05.649
Those tatements don't exist in a vacuum

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:07.396
When they, do, yeah, you can wind up with

00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:10.206
nonsense. But if you've got the context

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:13.464
if you know how to match one of these things

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:15.400
it can make sense.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:23.109
and so this talk is really the context, i think, for that

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.929
incremental change that I talked about last

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:28.496
year, fills in more of the detail. you can kind of

00:03:28.496 --> 00:03:30.628
understand, perhaps even go out on iTunes and look

00:03:30.628 --> 00:03:32.616
at last years talk this year and sort of have

00:03:32.616 --> 00:03:35.492
our own little time travel.

00:03:35.492 --> 00:03:37.804
Right, it's the context of incremental change.

00:03:37.804 --> 00:03:39.901
Basics + Habits. What does that mean?

00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:42.621
Basics: When I basics, it's the fundamental

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:47.741
choices that you make at the start of a project.

00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:50.352
You kind of make this whole serie

00:03:50.352 --> 00:03:52.684
of choices about what your project's gonna

00:03:52.684 --> 00:03:55.212
what your idea is, what software to use, all

00:03:55.212 --> 00:03:57.200
of these kinds of things. All those mental choices

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.409
you make at the beginning of a project.

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.784
And then Habits are the things that you do

00:04:01.784 --> 00:04:04.608
every day after that.

00:04:04.608 --> 00:04:06.782
Building on the basics and then you actually

00:04:06.782 --> 00:04:08.681
go and do all the work, invest all of the

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:10.657
time and effort to actually make the projec

00:04:10.657 --> 00:04:13.936
come to life.

00:04:13.936 --> 00:04:17.864
And so basics plus habits, hopefully, you;ll see

00:04:17.864 --> 00:04:20.821
I've got some ideas today about how this

00:04:20.821 --> 00:04:24.760
will create this context that then you can add

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.300
in your incremental change, some of your ideas from

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.730
last years talk.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.770
And eventyally, riught, wind up with a framework

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.809
that will help you to make your software

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:37.933
project successful and last a long time.

00:04:37.933 --> 00:04:42.241
I've got 6 basics that i'd like to talk about today

00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:44.736
i;ll go through them, the first one being

00:04:44.736 --> 00:04:48.617
define you physics and chemistry

00:04:48.617 --> 00:04:53.330
so physics and chemistry, i like this little analogy.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
you think about this in terms of software, again,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.760
it's an analogy, it's physics are the fundamental

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.730
laws of your project of your software world that

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.169
you create in your software.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.645
and then chemistry are the way that things can

00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:09.445
mix together. i'll be using this analogy quite a bit.

00:05:09.445 --> 00:05:12.800
and here's the first example. when I think about

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.157
kind of a very basic, kind of block diagram, a generic

00:05:16.157 --> 00:05:18.949
one, physics are the blue boxes.

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.781
they're kind of the basic, kind of elements of your system.

00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:24.357
particularly when you look at them from the outside

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:27.977
its the basic phyics, the real sort of unchangable

00:05:27.977 --> 00:05:30.330
nuggets in your system. at least the fundamental;

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.531
nuggest.

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:33.900
and then the arrows are the chemistry, or the

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.329
way these things combine, in this case like the

00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:38.505
Model-view-controller example, they combine

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:45.410
in ways that ... in keeping that MVC pattern.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.181
they combine in well-defined ways, right,

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.101
to mae your software work in the way that it does.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.269
so: the physics and the chemistry.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:57.493
now, i mean this is such a basic idea, such a fundamental

00:05:57.493 --> 00:06:00.301
idea, about how software works, that i think there

00:06:00.301 --> 00:06:03.850
are other analogies that people use oftentimes.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.297
like: nouns and verbs, where nouns are the abstractions

00:06:06.297 --> 00:06:08.781
and verbs are the way the things combine with each

00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:12.760
other. another, obviously very popular one, is objects

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.771
and interfaces, it's the encapsulated bits and the

00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:18.845
exposed bits and the interfaces that you have to

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:21.833
get at these exposed bits.

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:25.900
i still think that physics and chemistry though is the

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.361
best analogy, and again, i'll be returning to this quite

00:06:28.361 --> 00:06:32.425
a few times during the rest of the talk.

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:35.293
and i do think that ultimately most coding

00:06:35.293 --> 00:06:39.257
is chemistry. you;re most often kind of

00:06:39.257 --> 00:06:41.693
using the interfaces that you create. i mean you

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:45.620
create interfaces much less often than you use them.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.721
and of courtse this chemistry is expressed in terms

00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:52.565
of those interfaces, in terms of those physics.

00:06:52.565 --> 00:06:55.589
and so here now if we go back and look at a

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:59.117
more concrete example of that diagram that i had

00:06:59.117 --> 00:07:03.181
before: this basically, very basically, describes

00:07:03.181 --> 00:07:08.393
the design for the ios keyboard text entry system, that

00:07:08.393 --> 00:07:11.804
I do a lot of work for. this was my design for the

00:07:11.804 --> 00:07:14.217
1.0 keyboard. as you can see at the top i've got a

00:07:14.217 --> 00:07:18.264
keyboard controller, over then on the input manager

00:07:18.264 --> 00:07:21.632
side right that's where ive got the model and then there

00:07:21.632 --> 00:07:23.457
on this side i;ve got the user interface, keyboard

00:07:23.457 --> 00:07:28.708
layout, textfield... really it is kind of an mvc type pattern.

00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:32.237
now, if i go in and add the arrows, i'd like you to look

00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:35.421
closely or perhaps if you can't see i'll describe the

00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:40.694
view side, the arrows are bidirectional. they go both

00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:42.582
ways.

00:07:42.582 --> 00:07:47.357
yet on the model side, the arrows only go one way.

00:07:47.357 --> 00:07:50.729
and this actually is kind of an important design idea.

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:54.937
again, at the beginning a basic decision about how the

00:07:54.937 --> 00:07:58.730
software system was going to work. i didnt want

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.625
the dictionary to be calling back up to the controller.

00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:05.900
nonono, the dictionary, the input manager system was

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.781
called and returned a value. that's all that it did. it

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.909
only came into the system when it was called, whereas,

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:16.461
of course, the view system needed to respond to user

00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:19.229
touches, and of course needed to be updated

00:08:19.229 --> 00:08:23.549
as appropriate maybe when an autocorrection suggestion

00:08:23.549 --> 00:08:29.333
came in. and again here, the point is that this fundamental

00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:31.541
design was a basic decision that i made at the

00:08:31.541 --> 00:08:36.133
beginning of the project. and that i carried through

00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:40.363
through the rest of system. it wasnt liek this.

00:08:40.363 --> 00:08:43.336
very specifically it wasnt like that where anything could

00:08:43.336 --> 00:08:45.657
call anything else.

00:08:45.657 --> 00:08:47.913
of course it wouldn't be a show if it didnt have

00:08:47.913 --> 00:08:53.700
flames. so this is a much more kind of sensible

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:59.257
basic design for an mvc system.

00:08:59.257 --> 00:09:00.537
ok.

00:09:00.537 --> 00:09:03.757
So the idea is I think, too, is I think you wanna strive

00:09:03.757 --> 00:09:06.956
for solid physics, again for those last example those

00:09:06.956 --> 00:09:11.655
big blue boxes, they were senisble. sensible design.

00:09:11.655 --> 00:09:17.765
sensible big ideas for compoentns of the system

00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:20.956
and so you wanna strive for that solid physics at

00:09:20.956 --> 00:09:22.901
the beginning of your project and you don;t wan to

00:09:22.901 --> 00:09:25.841
be redefining the rules of your universe very lightly.

00:09:25.841 --> 00:09:27.973
of course you can;t change gravity and the

00:09:27.973 --> 00:09:29.960
conservation of energy and these are the physics

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.937
of the natural world are decided for us, but in your

00:09:33.937 --> 00:09:36.968
software you can change this just about as want.

00:09:36.968 --> 00:09:43.730
But dont! with great power comes great resposibilyt, right?

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.257
You wanna kind of get your physics right at the start

00:09:45.257 --> 00:09:47.296
of your project if you can.

00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:49.409
and perhaps maybe even the final way of talking

00:09:49.409 --> 00:09:52.132
about this is maybe a little bit more playful.

00:09:52.132 --> 00:09:54.821
maybe something that makes writing softeware so

00:09:54.821 --> 00:09:56.709
attractive to all of us is that you can make it a

00:09:56.709 --> 00:10:01.925
sandbox that then you go and play with. again it is

00:10:01.925 --> 00:10:03.997
sort of like you have that good feeling about a god

00:10:03.997 --> 00:10:07.469
successful project which you have made light and

00:10:07.469 --> 00:10:09.837
and you enjoy improving it, making it better, and

00:10:09.837 --> 00:10:11.727
then of course, all of you are going to make great apps.

00:10:11.727 --> 00:10:13.913
that go out to customers and you get great feedback

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:16.305
from them. it feels good if you have a successful

00:10:16.305 --> 00:10:19.249
project like that.

00:10:19.249 --> 00:10:26.857
So again: defining phsycs and chemistry, the first basic decision you need to make.

00:10:26.857 --> 00:10:29.537
second: choosing the right technology.

00:10:29.537 --> 00:10:31.593
make a technology choice for how you;re going to

00:10:31.593 --> 00:10:33.889
make your project work right at the beginning.

00:10:33.889 --> 00:10:36.957
now, of cours,e in choosing technology: you're here

00:10:36.957 --> 00:10:40.743
at WWDC, it is kind of preaching to the choir. You already

00:10:40.743 --> 00:10:42.973
have chosen great technology: you've chosen Apple,

00:10:42.973 --> 00:10:48.685
you;ve chosen macos and ios, so congratulations, you're all awesame.

00:10:48.685 --> 00:10:53.381
give yourself a round of applause.

00:10:53.381 --> 00:10:56.110
you have also chosen this talk this morning, so

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:59.309
thank you for that.

00:10:59.309 --> 00:11:05.105
but now: more to the point, if you think about

00:11:05.105 --> 00:11:09.529
tools when you maybe gonna build a house, sometimes

00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:11.160
you need to go and grab a hammer, and that is

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.740
an appropriate tool, and then you grab a wrench

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.113
and that's an appropriate tool. but they;re not appropriate

00:11:15.113 --> 00:11:19.737
for all tasks; pretty obvious. the same is true for software.

00:11:19.737 --> 00:11:24.801
we have got some great software on our paltforms.

00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:28.317
coredata is a good example. it is a great piece of software

00:11:28.317 --> 00:11:31.701
for if you;re developing and app and you got some

00:11:31.701 --> 00:11:35.600
objects in your system. at runtime you maybe wanna

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.853
save the state of some of these objects, you m aybe

00:11:37.853 --> 00:11:40.149
wanna save the objects themselves. use coredata, sace

00:11:40.149 --> 00:11:44.713
them to a database, it is a great technology. it does

00:11:44.713 --> 00:11:46.684
that object relational mapping system. how many people

00:11:46.684 --> 00:11:49.553
are "yes, my name is xxx and i have made my own object

00:11:49.553 --> 00:11:53.320
mapping system. i have a problem". i have done that problem

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.256
many times. coredata solves that problem. you dont have

00:11:57.256 --> 00:11:59.784
to do that yourself. it is a great technology choice

00:11:59.784 --> 00:12:03.240
if you're an app developer. But if you're building a web

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.476
search engine and you're building a big server farm

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:10.357
ithen probably core data is not the best choice, even

00:12:10.357 --> 00:12:12.912
though it is a great technology.

00:12:12.912 --> 00:12:16.236
it;s not the great best choice for that particular task.

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:21.588
so i think the message here, aprticularly at WWDC

00:12:21.588 --> 00:12:25.620
is that if you;re new to our platforms, kind of new to

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.749
ios, new to macos development: learn our frameworks!

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:31.837
know what;s available. go to the labs. find an apple

00:12:31.837 --> 00:12:34.213
engineer. if you;ve got an idea, see if we've got

00:12:34.213 --> 00:12:39.105
software already there for you to take advantage of.

00:12:39.105 --> 00:12:43.184
learn our framework. know what's available and figure

00:12:43.184 --> 00:12:46.417
out how to best match what you need to do to the task

00:12:46.417 --> 00:12:49.193
you want to accomplish.

00:12:49.193 --> 00:12:52.769
now sometimes even after you do that you find out

00:12:52.769 --> 00:12:55.185
everything that's avaialbe, everything that we've got,

00:12:55.185 --> 00:12:57.705
and it doesn't quite match what you want to do,

00:12:57.705 --> 00:13:01.701
sometimes then, but only from knowledge, you need to

00:13:01.701 --> 00:13:03.198
go outside the box.

00:13:03.198 --> 00:13:06.509
and again, there is an example that I would like to tell

00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:11.428
you about: it's NSString in Foundation. Of course it's great

00:13:11.428 --> 00:13:17.509
for general purpose programming, but is it great for high-performance string handlign?

00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:22.330
High performance when I need to do substrings lots na lots of comparisons, like

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.217
again the example was the iphone keybaord.

00:13:26.217 --> 00:13:29.864
when i was making the original autocorrection algorithm

00:13:29.864 --> 00:13:33.784
the first few tries that i made was basically brute-force.

00:13:33.784 --> 00:13:38.738
searching the entire dictionary every time you typed a key.

00:13:38.738 --> 00:13:42.187
logically, that's what is was doing, but it could do that,

00:13:42.187 --> 00:13:46.724
so i needed some kind of high performance string routines to

00:13:46.724 --> 00:13:50.290
make that actually perform well. and so what I wound up

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.366
doing was developing my own custom c++ string class

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:56.928
using a lot of stack-allocation, using the shrot string

00:13:56.928 --> 00:13:59.740
optimization, yeah, get a little bit of c++ geekness

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.253
into every show.

00:14:01.253 --> 00:14:05.370
not only that, yes, this shortstring optimization is now

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.872
in libc++. the new c++ library that we're developong

00:14:09.872 --> 00:14:12.377
and making available as part of llvm which

00:14:12.377 --> 00:14:16.650
is really nice. we didnt have that back in 2005.

00:14:16.650 --> 99:59:59.999
so: should you do this? probably not!

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Only, you only make a choice to go outside of the box

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
when you have determined that you really need to.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Because, again, what we are providing to you as part of

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
our frameworks don't quite fit the bill.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Now, I will say, interestingly, that even though this seems like

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
a sort of a low level optimization, was that premature optimization?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And I don't really think that it is. Again, I think because this is

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
an optimization that has to do with physics, I could have

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
changed the class out for another one with the same

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
interface and it would have been alright.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I didn't really paint myself into a corner.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
In other words, this was an optimization that was a

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
technology choice, not an activity, not making sort of

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
very very complicated algorithms that had a lot of

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
interdependencies with each other - which then are much

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
more difficult to undo if you decide it doesn't really

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
quite work, or that you need to change them.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
It was kind of optimization in terms of physics. It sometimes

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
can be a little bit safer than optimizations in chemistry.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Again, the real share in this section is: Learn our frameworks.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Come to our labs, after the show, go to our

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
developer forums, find an Apple engineer, learn what

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
we have available.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So that's basic number 2.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Basic number 3 is "Build solid abstractions".

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
When you're thinking about your project upfront you

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
kind of think about, again, maybe even basic chemistry

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
building blocks that you want to use for your code.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And so I got an example. Here is a declaration of the

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
dispatch_async call, aprt of the dispatch framework.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Of course, this is a really, really great part of our frameworks,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
because as it says "schedule the block for concurrent

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
execution with the dispatch framework"

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Really neat technology. It makes writing concurrent code

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
much easier to do.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So. Now that you know this... Right? You've read the

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
man page, you;ve read the developer documentation...

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And now you've got a piece of code like this where

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
you've got a loop and you need to do expensive work

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
with every object in an array and - ugh - you go and

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
you profile and it's slow.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So you figure "I've got a couple of cores on this system

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I'll just go and fix it like that, right?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I'll do dispatch_async and do all this work on the background

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
thread and it's just like "Wahoo!", right?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Ermm... No. Not "Wahoo!". Why is that not the right answer?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Now, I think, that what you've done, what that piece of

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
code has done, is that gives you chemistry without physics.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You just sprinkle in a little dispatch_async... It's probably

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
not the right thing to do. And again, this is why

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
it is not the right thing to do: You've got chemistry without

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
physics. Concurrent code is complex and I think when you

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
introduce that into your program, you need suitable

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
abstractions to build on, to make it come out right.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So. I think the way to do that is in terms of objects

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
and interfaces. Define your work in terms of the job that

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
you want done.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So here is this little trivial example. Let's maybe use a

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
different example that's a little more real world, which is

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
maybe a piece of an image app that generates thumbnails

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
for larger images.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You see here, I've got a ThumbnailMaker interface that says make a thumbnail.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Then an Observer which gives me a hook to call back

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
after a thumbnail is finished being made.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Here's a piece of code to do this:

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I've got my photo program which is itself a ThumbnailMakerObserver

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Maybe I've got this interface that perhaps some other part

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
of my software calls.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
to say "ok, i've got an image and I need a thumbnail for it".

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I dispatch_async onto a background queue to the

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
ThumbnailMaker object, which is, of course, defined on

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
the bottom of the screen, to make a thumbnail and I

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
pass myself in as the observer, right?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Now, of course, that code goes and runs. It makes the

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
thumbnail - churn, churn, churn - does the work, makes

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
the thumbnail, dispatches async back to the observer,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
back to the main program, says it is done. Ok.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Thumbnail available now, go and update the user interace.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Take the gray box and replace it with the thumbnail.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Very very simple.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
But, I think you can see, that this is chemistry with physics.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
There is design.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
dispatch_async is an implementation detail of this larger picture.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
which you could sketch on a board. You've have your big

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
boxes now.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
It's better. That's a much much better way to approach

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
the problem. Again - kind of a trivial example - but I think

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
it gets across a really important point.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Because, now, you're thinking about the software not

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
in terms of thumbnails, not in terms of just dispatching

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
as part of a loop... You've got sort of structure, a framework

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
for your thinking.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You've got an interface that will hopefully stand the test

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
of time.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And additionally, if you have to change your implementation,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
sometime in the future, to maybe server-generated

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
thumbnails that are now shipping as images over a

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
network. The thumbnail generated and then come back.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Probably that interface, that might actually work,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Instead of dispatch_async, well, send the raw image, the

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
full resolution image over the network and have a thumbnail

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
generated for you.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I think that's a much much more solid abstraction.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Again, defining your work in terms of the job

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
that you want done.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And I think that's basic number 3.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Number 4: Optimize for humans

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And I think this is something that is a good idea

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
to always keep in mind as you're designing your project.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Particularly, if it is going to have a long life, that you're

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
gonna be maintaining it. And you want to be kind to

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
your future self today. So here is an example of

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
that: A lot of times we use these data and wire formats

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
in our programs... XML, JSON, plists, Google Protocol Buffers, what have you.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Here is an example of a little JSON structure that I might

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
be getting. It is a coupon. It has an expiration date, a name

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
and - hey - it's got a pitch, too: Get 25% off on your

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
next purchase.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Now, you might that, well, I am gonna be receiving

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
this over the network from some service or partner,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
perhaps I'm making the next great coupon app.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I might think that in my program then I receive that

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
JSON over the network and that I'm gonna need some

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Objective-C code to deal with that coupon, and I'll

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
just write it like this: I'll just have a getProperty, setProperty

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
interface for the coupon, and that's how I'll pick apart

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
the details.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I think, that's a bad idea.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Now you have chemistry trumping your physics.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Now you've got the fact that you are using JSON or

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
one of these other wire formats making decisions about

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
how your software is designed. You're not designing

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
for yourself, you're designing it for this wire format.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And you wind up with a weird universe like that.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Instead of something like this

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
you wind up with something like this!

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You have over-emphasized how data is traveling from

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
one place to another, rather than how you need

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
to deal with it when it gets to your program.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And I think this is bad, because brain power is your

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
scarcest resource. If you try to remember what property

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
name was pitch inside of a dictionary? You don't

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
don't want to be worried about that.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
It's not CPU power or network bandwidth that is or will

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
be the limiting factor in making your sofware.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
It's brain power. You want to conserve that

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
as much as you can

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So what can you do about this?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Instead of having an interface - a weak object interface - getProperty, setProperty...

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I think you could do something like this:

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Instead where you've got methods that take JSON data

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
in, create your object, can also vend the JSON data back

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
out in case you need to send it back out to the network

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
even after modifying it, and then give yourself a nice

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
good strong object interface to work with.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Now you don't need to remember "is the pitch inside of

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
some kind of dictionary?"

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
If it is or is not does not matter, you will have taken care

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
of that - presumably - in the init method.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And now that property is just available for you

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
to go to and use.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Now you can go and see - maybe you've gone away from this code for a few months - you can look at

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
the header and see "what's a coupon?"

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You don't need to kind of go "Do I have an example

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
of this kind of coupon JSON data somewhere on disk?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You don't need to worry about that.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You've done the work to give yourself a good strong

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
object interface. You've optimized for yourself. Not

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
for serialization or the networking protocol.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And again, that's something that you bake into your project

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
at the beginning, when you're making your fundamental

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
interfaces and designing how your system works.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Optimize for yourself!

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Next: Basic number 5.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Focus your development effort.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
I think at the beginning of a project it is a good idea

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
to ask yourself what you are trying to be great at

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You should have a good answer for that question.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Who is your audience? Who else in the world, once

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
they find my app, is going to think "this is great"?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
and why are they gonna think that it is great?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You wanna make sure you have answers for these questions.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And you wanna make sure that you're building that!

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
That you are actually delivering on that greatness that

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
you are trying to achieve.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And I think that, of course, iOS and OS X give you

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
great foundation to stand on, literally and figuratively,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
you know, Foundation, Framework, right?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Stand on our shoulders, build your great software, using

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
our frameworks. Learn them.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Again. I am sounding like broken record, for those of

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
you who are old enough to know what that is...

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And it is kind of interesting, too. I mean it's a little

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
digression. We wind up with a little recursive physics

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
and chemistry. There are people, obviously, in Apple

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
where UIKit is there little chemistry set. They're going

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
to be developing UIKit deciding on what the chemistry

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
and chemistry is.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
For you that's just physics. UIKit is what it is.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
It's not changeable by you. It's just part of the physical

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
reality, the unchangable law of your universe if you are

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
working on iOS.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And that is kind of interesting, too. You might want to

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
do that in your own software.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Develop libraries that are then unchangeable by

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
higher levels of code.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You might even want to do this for models - the model

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
of your program - and then have user interface level

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
level: One for iPhone, one for iPad, that treats that layer

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
as sort of an unchangable physics. Kind of an interesting

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
little idea.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Ok, now more concrete examples.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Which is sort of getting to the idea of that you want

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
to focus on what makes your software novel and interesting,.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
An example is: if you love the way that iOS device auto

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
rotation works, don't spend time implementing that yourself.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You need to learn our frameworks and find out that UIViewController provides that for you.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Similarly, if you need database interaction, you want to

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
save some of your app's runtime data in a database, learn

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
about CoreData. Don't go invent your own object-relational

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
mapping software.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
If you need animation, learn CoreAnimation. It's the same

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
thing.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
If you need X, then you maybe not even quite sure, what that is.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
What name to call it, because you don't if we have that in our frameworks, ask in the labs. That's

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
why you're here this week; or the developer forums

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
after. This week, since you're here, find an Apple

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
engineer and ask your question.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Because in the end you want to be working on the thing

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
that's gonna make or break your application.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
That's what you want to be working on. That's where you want to be spending your time.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So focus your development effort right from the start.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And then lastly: You always want to be looking to the horizon a little bit.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
What if you're successful? What if your app works?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And people love it? They're downloading it!

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
What if maybe you've got a little service that's attached

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
to it where people can upload content, download content... Can you handle it?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
What about performance? How much headroom do you have in your software for things like performance,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
or perhaps even for future features which you may be able to get in your 1.0,

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
but you definitely want to get to for your 2.0.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
So you really want to be building in a little bit of

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
headroom, if you can, into your application.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
But how to do that?

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Another area to think about if you saw Andre's talk

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
on Monday about Internationalization:

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
There is a huge opportunity out there for you to ship

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
your app all around the world.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
If you localize it into the language spoken by those

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
people in other countries.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
We've got great support for internationalizing, localizing

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
your application. Strings, dates, times, addresses, names, whatever...

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You want to be thinking about using our software

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
right from the beginning, so then when it comes

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
to localize your kind of on the road.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
You can kind of take advantage of our great localization

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
features to ship your app all over the world. I really

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
urge you to do that, it is a huge opportunity for you.

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
And kind of getting back to that idea - I said, you might

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
have an idea about a 2.0 of your program - or maybe

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
you think of a great new feature after you've got
